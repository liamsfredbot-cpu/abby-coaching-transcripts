## Transcript

[00:00:00] Abby Jorgensen: But right now, I'm just kind of learning as I go.
[00:00:05] Abby Jorgensen: So a lot of different tasks.
[00:00:07] Abby Jorgensen: So it's a lot of information all at once.
[00:00:11] Abby Jorgensen: Yes, it is, isn't it?
[00:00:12] Gerard Donnelly: Yeah.
[00:00:14] Abby Jorgensen: You're good at absorbing stuff.
[00:00:16] Gerard Donnelly: Yeah.
[00:00:17] Abby Jorgensen: I mean, it's like I'm catching on.
[00:00:18] Abby Jorgensen: It's just depending on who's training me that day.
[00:00:21] Abby Jorgensen: Some people are better at laying information than others.
[00:00:28] Gerard Donnelly: It gives you a good insight into how important it is to be explaining things, doesn't it?
[00:00:34] Gerard Donnelly: Yeah.
[00:00:35] Abby Jorgensen: Well, I mean, the one guy, like he's one of the owners, but he just talks and talks and like, like, it's almost too much.
[00:00:41] Abby Jorgensen: I'm like, just let me watch and do it.
[00:00:45] Abby Jorgensen: You don't have to talk all the time, but it's all good.
[00:00:50] Gerard Donnelly: How are you feeling with your own training?
[00:00:52] Gerard Donnelly: Are feeling tired or are you okay?
[00:00:55] Abby Jorgensen: Yeah, I'm okay.
[00:00:56] Abby Jorgensen: I'm just getting used to getting up early again on the days I work because
[00:01:00] Abby Jorgensen: I work 7.
[00:01:01] Abby Jorgensen: I go in at 7 a.m., so I try to get up by 4.15, 4.30 and get whatever I need to get done in because I don't get off usually.
[00:01:11] Abby Jorgensen: I get a break in the middle of the day a little bit, but not enough to, like, really do much.
[00:01:16] Abby Jorgensen: And then I don't get home until after 6, and I really don't like to work out that late at night.
[00:01:22] Abby Jorgensen: Yep.
[00:01:23] Abby Jorgensen: Yep.
[00:01:24] Gerard Donnelly: And what are you doing in your break?
[00:01:25] Gerard Donnelly: Are just having a bit of a rest, a bit of a lunch and rest?
[00:01:28] Gerard Donnelly: Yeah, lunch.
[00:01:29] Abby Jorgensen: I'll come home.
[00:01:30] Abby Jorgensen: If I don't bring my dogs to work, I'll walk them, and occasionally I'll do a small little strength session.
[00:01:37] Abby Jorgensen: Yep.
[00:01:37] Abby Jorgensen: Okay.
[00:01:38] Abby Jorgensen: Yep.
[00:01:39] Gerard Donnelly: That's great.
[00:01:40] Gerard Donnelly: So are we getting your schedule right with the Monday, Thursday, Sunday?
[00:01:46] Gerard Donnelly: Yeah.
[00:01:47] Abby Jorgensen: Today was, I just, going to bed last night, I didn't know what I was doing.
[00:01:52] Abby Jorgensen: So, like, I kind of didn't have enough.
[00:01:57] Abby Jorgensen: I wanted to get some other stuff done, so I just went for two hours.
[00:02:00] Abby Jorgensen: First today, I think.
[00:02:02] Abby Jorgensen: Yeah.
[00:02:03] Abby Jorgensen: But my apologies.
[00:02:05] Gerard Donnelly: That was me being late.
[00:02:07] Abby Jorgensen: It's all right.
[00:02:08] Abby Jorgensen: I was like, well, I'll just do a bike when I get up and then swim in a little bit.
[00:02:13] Abby Jorgensen: But then I was like, I got up and I saw two and a half hours and I was like, well, I'll just go swim now.
[00:02:20] Gerard Donnelly: As of swimming, you enjoying it?
[00:02:23] Abby Jorgensen: Yeah, it's I think it helps with my recovery more than anything.
[00:02:27] Abby Jorgensen: Yeah.
[00:02:29] Abby Jorgensen: Yeah.
[00:02:30] Abby Jorgensen: And everything just feels, I don't know, I feel pretty smooth in the water right now.
[00:02:34] Abby Jorgensen: Yeah, that's good.
[00:02:35] Abby Jorgensen: Yep.
[00:02:36] Gerard Donnelly: And what about, we're not trying to ride hard, but does it feel like when you're riding just for fun rather than, you know, staying in numbers and having restrictions about what you should do?
[00:02:50] Gerard Donnelly: Does that feel enjoyable again?
[00:02:52] Gerard Donnelly: Because that's what we're trying to do.
[00:02:54] Gerard Donnelly: Yeah.
[00:02:55] Abby Jorgensen: Yeah, I don't even, I didn't really pay attention too much to my numbers today.
[00:02:59] Abby Jorgensen: So, I just.
[00:03:00] Abby Jorgensen: It's kind of went out and rode my normal route.
[00:03:03] Abby Jorgensen: mean, it's really hot here for almost October, so that part wasn't super enjoyable.
[00:03:13] Gerard Donnelly: Well, just remember, it's going to be cold soon.
[00:03:16] Abby Jorgensen: Oh, I try to tell myself, I'm like, don't complain because pretty soon.
[00:03:22] Gerard Donnelly: Have you had any more thoughts about the next six months of events and goals?
[00:03:32] Abby Jorgensen: I mean, I did just sign up for a half marathon in three weeks here in Des Moines.
[00:03:39] Abby Jorgensen: So I'll have that.
[00:03:41] Abby Jorgensen: I figured that's really nothing to me at this point.
[00:03:47] Abby Jorgensen: But yeah, and then I think I want to do like the, it'd be a marathon here in Des Moines in March.
[00:03:54] Abby Jorgensen: It's usually our St.
[00:03:56] Abby Jorgensen: Paddy's.
[00:03:56] Abby Jorgensen: It's a St.
[00:03:57] Abby Jorgensen: Paddy's Day.
[00:03:58] Abby Jorgensen: Yes, okay.
[00:03:59] Gerard Donnelly: Marathon.
[00:04:00] Abby Jorgensen: And then the Des Moines 70.3, they moved to Omaha, so I think I'll do that for sure, because that's only, like I said, two hours.
[00:04:11] Gerard Donnelly: What month's that?
[00:04:12] Gerard Donnelly: I'm just making notes here.
[00:04:14] Gerard Donnelly: June.
[00:04:14] Abby Jorgensen: June, like, 8th.
[00:04:16] Abby Jorgensen: It's like the early June.
[00:04:18] Abby Jorgensen: And then a possible, like, September 70.3 in Michigan, possibly.
[00:04:27] Gerard Donnelly: So you said they moved Des Moines' race to where?
[00:04:31] Gerard Donnelly: Omaha, Nebraska.
[00:04:34] Gerard Donnelly: Okay.
[00:04:35] Gerard Donnelly: And that's only a couple of hours' drive.
[00:04:37] Abby Jorgensen: Yeah.
[00:04:38] Gerard Donnelly: And then September is a 70.3.
[00:04:40] Gerard Donnelly: Where was that?
[00:04:42] Abby Jorgensen: Michigan.
[00:04:43] Abby Jorgensen: Okay.
[00:04:44] Abby Jorgensen: Is that hilly?
[00:04:46] Gerard Donnelly: I haven't really looked at it.
[00:04:47] Abby Jorgensen: I just kind of decided.
[00:04:49] Gerard Donnelly: You need to check before you decide what races you're doing.
[00:04:55] Abby Jorgensen: I don't think it's too bad, actually.
[00:04:57] Abby Jorgensen: Yeah.
[00:04:57] Gerard Donnelly: What's the Nebraska line?
[00:04:59] Abby Jorgensen: Uh...
[00:05:00] Abby Jorgensen: It's probably about the same as here in Des Moines.
[00:05:03] Abby Jorgensen: Yeah, okay.
[00:05:04] Abby Jorgensen: It has, I mean, it has some rolling hills, but it's not, like, crazy.
[00:05:11] Abby Jorgensen: Is it a very big marathon, the one at home?
[00:05:15] Gerard Donnelly: Not really.
[00:05:16] Abby Jorgensen: It's just kind of a, like, hey, it's St.
[00:05:18] Abby Jorgensen: Maddie's Day, and they do a half marathon and a full.
[00:05:22] Abby Jorgensen: Yeah.
[00:05:22] Abby Jorgensen: So it's not, like, sanctioned by, like, you can't qualify for Boston or anything with it.
[00:05:29] Abby Jorgensen: Yeah.
[00:05:31] Gerard Donnelly: All right.
[00:05:31] Gerard Donnelly: Well, that's a good little starting point, I think.
[00:05:35] Gerard Donnelly: Yeah.
[00:05:36] Gerard Donnelly: That's a little bit of work between now and March.
[00:05:39] Gerard Donnelly: mean, it's already October.
[00:05:40] Gerard Donnelly: So we've got October, November, December, January, February.
[00:05:42] Gerard Donnelly: So we've got five months to get you.
[00:05:49] Gerard Donnelly: What would you be thinking your goal would be for the marathon now that you've already run one at four hours in an Ironman?
[00:05:56] Abby Jorgensen: Um, I, like, I was looking at, I know this, this marathon.
[00:06:00] Abby Jorgensen: Thank you.
[00:06:00] Abby Jorgensen: you.
[00:06:00] Abby Jorgensen: One isn't like a Boston qualifier, but for my age group, it's like 345, 340, and I think that's doable for me.
[00:06:13] Abby Jorgensen: Yes, I would agree.
[00:06:16] Gerard Donnelly: Would you want to qualify for Boston somewhere?
[00:06:19] Abby Jorgensen: I think eventually that would be like another cool kind of goal.
[00:06:23] Abby Jorgensen: Everybody talks about like it's a cool thing to do.
[00:06:27] Abby Jorgensen: What month is Boston?
[00:06:30] Gerard Donnelly: Uh, is it April?
[00:06:34] Abby Jorgensen: No.
[00:06:36] Abby Jorgensen: April, May.
[00:06:38] Abby Jorgensen: I can't remember off the top of my head.
[00:06:40] Abby Jorgensen: know it's...
[00:06:42] Abby Jorgensen: I'll Google it.
[00:06:43] Gerard Donnelly: Sorry.
[00:06:48] Gerard Donnelly: 20th of April.
[00:06:50] Gerard Donnelly: Yeah, I figured it was April.
[00:06:52] Abby Jorgensen: Yep.
[00:06:53] Gerard Donnelly: Um, so...
[00:06:58] Gerard Donnelly: Um...
[00:06:59] Gerard Donnelly: Um...
[00:06:59] Gerard Donnelly: Um...
[00:07:00] Gerard Donnelly: Maybe two thousand twenty seven.
[00:07:03] Abby Jorgensen: Yeah, that would be kind of I was kind of too late to to sign up for anything.
[00:07:08] Abby Jorgensen: Yeah.
[00:07:09] Abby Jorgensen: This year.
[00:07:10] Abby Jorgensen: And with my full Ironman, it was kind of like, yeah, that's too, too much.
[00:07:15] Abby Jorgensen: Yeah.
[00:07:17] Abby Jorgensen: I want my I'm my friends are trying to convince me to do a backyard ultra next year.
[00:07:24] Abby Jorgensen: Late fall as well.
[00:07:26] Abby Jorgensen: But no.
[00:07:31] Gerard Donnelly: If you if you seriously want to get better at marathon, you've got to run another one at Des Moines.
[00:07:39] Gerard Donnelly: Between Des Moines and 2027 April, you've got to run another marathon to qualify.
[00:07:44] Gerard Donnelly: So, you know, the choice would be not to do a marathon in March at Des Moines.
[00:07:50] Gerard Donnelly: Just do the half at St.
[00:07:52] Gerard Donnelly: Paddy's Day and then do another marathon somewhere where you can actually qualify.
[00:07:57] Gerard Donnelly: It gives you more time.
[00:07:59] Gerard Donnelly: I don't know.
[00:08:00] Gerard Donnelly: You would have to look at the qualifying races that are near to you.
[00:08:05] Gerard Donnelly: So if you really wanted to go down that track, you know, doing a marathon in March is probably, you know, not the best idea.
[00:08:13] Gerard Donnelly: If you wanted to do one in, I don't know, June, July, August, September, you wouldn't want to be doing, you know, three marathons.
[00:08:24] Abby Jorgensen: I could do the one I'm doing here in three weeks, the half, they have a full.
[00:08:30] Abby Jorgensen: And that one's a qualifier for the next year, so you could do that too as well.
[00:08:37] Gerard Donnelly: But it's just so short notice, haven't really been.
[00:08:40] Gerard Donnelly: I know you've got fitness from the Ironman, but it's, yeah, I think that's a bad idea.
[00:08:50] Gerard Donnelly: To do a in March, like wait until.
[00:08:53] Gerard Donnelly: No, I thought you said in three weeks time to do a marathon.
[00:08:56] Gerard Donnelly: Oh, no, no.
[00:08:59] Abby Jorgensen: Just to do do that.
[00:09:00] Abby Jorgensen: Half, the half there, the half in March, and then a full October, yeah.
[00:09:08] Gerard Donnelly: Yeah, but you'd have to pick a race that's, you know, easily accessible to you, and, you it's a very competitive field to get into, so, you know, you want to look at, like I do with the pros that we coach, you know, they don't necessarily have to go to the biggest races, you know, like there's, like there's 50 races in a year, you know, of course they would like to do the world championships, but every other race, you would look at, you know, who's going to go there, so they've got the best opportunity to do well, you know, it's not avoiding competition, it's just making sure that you get the goal of what you want to do, which is perform well, and sponsors, as, you know, professionals, as sponsors, they want to, they want to see you getting, you know, they they want to see you coming.
[00:10:01] Gerard Donnelly: You know, they want to see you in the first three or four, so you wouldn't go to races where the top 15 athletes are in every race.
[00:10:08] Gerard Donnelly: You go and find races where they're not.
[00:10:11] Gerard Donnelly: So same thing with an age group marathon.
[00:10:13] Gerard Donnelly: You wouldn't want to go to the race that's the most popular race for people qualifying.
[00:10:17] Gerard Donnelly: You go and find a race that's, you know, no one's going to.
[00:10:21] Gerard Donnelly: That way you've got more, you're going to give yourself more opportunity, that's all.
[00:10:25] Gerard Donnelly: Yeah.
[00:10:28] Gerard Donnelly: But yeah, all right, let's have a little bit of a look at what races are around.
[00:10:37] Gerard Donnelly: There's nothing wrong with doing the Des Moines Marathon in March.
[00:10:40] Gerard Donnelly: There's nothing wrong with that.
[00:10:41] Gerard Donnelly: But if you're going to do another marathon, it's kind of, you know, you would have done one.
[00:10:46] Gerard Donnelly: When was the Ironman?
[00:10:47] Gerard Donnelly: What month was that?
[00:10:49] Gerard Donnelly: July?
[00:10:50] Abby Jorgensen: September.
[00:10:51] Abby Jorgensen: What?
[00:10:52] Gerard Donnelly: Or the Ironman you just did.
[00:10:54] Gerard Donnelly: Was that?
[00:10:54] Gerard Donnelly: How many weeks ago was it?
[00:10:56] Gerard Donnelly: About four.
[00:10:57] Abby Jorgensen: Four weeks.
[00:10:58] Abby Jorgensen: Yeah.
[00:10:58] Gerard Donnelly: So, yeah, it's a marathon there.
[00:11:00] Gerard Donnelly: Marathon.
[00:11:00] Gerard Donnelly: March, Marathon, October, Marathon back in April.
[00:11:06] Gerard Donnelly: So that's four marathons in 12 months.
[00:11:10] Gerard Donnelly: Yeah, that's a lot for your body to cope with.
[00:11:14] Gerard Donnelly: So there, just thinking about that, that's all.
[00:11:16] Abby Jorgensen: Yeah, makes sense when you look at it like that.
[00:11:19] Gerard Donnelly: Yeah.
[00:11:20] Gerard Donnelly: You could do it.
[00:11:21] Gerard Donnelly: Yeah.
[00:11:23] Gerard Donnelly: You're just not getting the recovery, you know.
[00:11:28] Gerard Donnelly: and people go, oh, I could do three Ironmans in a year.
[00:11:31] Gerard Donnelly: Well, you can, but you're probably not going to do them as fresh as you want to every time.
[00:11:36] Gerard Donnelly: You're going to carry fatigue.
[00:11:37] Gerard Donnelly: You just keep carrying fatigue all the time.
[00:11:38] Gerard Donnelly: You can't train because you have to recover from the damn thing.
[00:11:41] Gerard Donnelly: have to taper into it, then recover.
[00:11:43] Gerard Donnelly: So it's like a six-week thing, two-week taper, four-week recovery.
[00:11:47] Gerard Donnelly: So, all right, well, that's something we can keep discussing, hey?
[00:11:54] Abby Jorgensen: Yeah, that's fine.
[00:11:55] Abby Jorgensen: Good.
[00:11:56] Gerard Donnelly: All right, we'll jump into the athletes.
[00:11:58] Gerard Donnelly: Anything else on you?
[00:11:59] Gerard Donnelly: All
[00:12:00] Gerard Donnelly: Uh, no, that should be good.
[00:12:02] Gerard Donnelly: Um, so if we're going to do a bit more run focus, I think we need to add another run somewhere, Abby.
[00:12:14] Abby Jorgensen: That's fine.
[00:12:14] Abby Jorgensen: I'd prefer that.
[00:12:16] Abby Jorgensen: That's fine.
[00:12:16] Abby Jorgensen: Yeah.
[00:12:17] Gerard Donnelly: Easier sometimes.
[00:12:19] Abby Jorgensen: Yeah.
[00:12:20] Gerard Donnelly: Um.
[00:12:25] Gerard Donnelly: Yeah, I'll just have to play around with your calendar.
[00:12:27] Gerard Donnelly: It's a bit restricting when you've got.
[00:12:29] Gerard Donnelly: I know.
[00:12:29] Gerard Donnelly: Your rest days are Monday, Thursday, Sundays.
[00:12:35] Gerard Donnelly: So maybe, maybe, uh, we, we knock out the Saturday or Wednesday ride and replace that with a run.
[00:12:49] Gerard Donnelly: Okay.
[00:12:50] Gerard Donnelly: Okay.
[00:12:51] Abby Jorgensen: That's fine.
[00:12:51] Gerard Donnelly: So, yeah.
[00:12:55] Gerard Donnelly: If we're going to, so you've got, you've got Sunday off and Monday off.
[00:12:59] Gerard Donnelly: So we're really.
[00:13:04] Abby Jorgensen: Yeah, mean, I can run back-to-back, that never really bothers me.
[00:13:09] Abby Jorgensen: Yeah.
[00:13:12] Gerard Donnelly: I'm just thinking we make the Sunday a bit longer ride and a run, and then Monday a longer run without the ride.
[00:13:20] Gerard Donnelly: That would be good to do.
[00:13:23] Gerard Donnelly: I'll have a play around with it.
[00:13:24] Abby Jorgensen: Okay.
[00:13:27] Gerard Donnelly: All right.
[00:13:30] Gerard Donnelly: We're going start with the new people.
[00:13:31] Gerard Donnelly: Where's Michael Abernathy going?
[00:13:34] Abby Jorgensen: Good.
[00:13:35] Abby Jorgensen: Let me see.
[00:13:36] Abby Jorgensen: I just was talking to him about his, he has a century ride this weekend.
[00:13:41] Abby Jorgensen: Yes.
[00:13:42] Abby Jorgensen: So I wanted to, he wanted a little bit of recovery before that because he wants to do well.
[00:13:49] Abby Jorgensen: His runs have been feeling, he says he's not sore.
[00:13:52] Abby Jorgensen: He's feeling really good.
[00:13:54] Abby Jorgensen: He's hitting.
[00:13:55] Abby Jorgensen: So I said, we, you know, start to, so the next week I thought maybe just like.
[00:14:00] Abby Jorgensen: Start with like a 20-minute like easy run and just kind of ease them in that way.
[00:14:05] Abby Jorgensen: Yep.
[00:14:07] Gerard Donnelly: I'll share the page with you.
[00:14:20] Gerard Donnelly: You used FJP last week, too.
[00:14:22] Abby Jorgensen: Yeah.
[00:14:25] Abby Jorgensen: It went up a little bit.
[00:14:29] Gerard Donnelly: How was his execution?
[00:14:31] Gerard Donnelly: it okay?
[00:14:33] Gerard Donnelly: It wasn't the best.
[00:14:36] Abby Jorgensen: It's very kind of choppy.
[00:14:42] Gerard Donnelly: So what equipment is he on?
[00:14:45] Gerard Donnelly: on a road bike?
[00:14:46] Gerard Donnelly: Just remind me.
[00:14:48] Abby Jorgensen: No, it's a TT.
[00:14:51] Abby Jorgensen: I'm trying to remember.
[00:14:52] Abby Jorgensen: Oh, it's a road bike, but he's having trouble finding aero bars for it because it has.
[00:14:59] Abby Jorgensen: Yeah.
[00:15:00] Abby Jorgensen: Yeah.
[00:15:00] Abby Jorgensen: Thank
[00:15:00] Abby Jorgensen: Yeah.
[00:15:01] Abby Jorgensen: Flat bars or whatever those are.
[00:15:04] Gerard Donnelly: Well, he did reach out to me about that.
[00:15:09] Abby Jorgensen: When he gets a bike fit, he's going to ask the guy.
[00:15:13] Abby Jorgensen: And I think that's in a few weeks here, so.
[00:15:16] Abby Jorgensen: Good.
[00:15:22] Gerard Donnelly: Sorry.
[00:15:24] Gerard Donnelly: I'm just looking up.
[00:15:28] Gerard Donnelly: I'm just looking up his...
[00:15:33] Gerard Donnelly: FJP, what was he last time?
[00:15:36] Abby Jorgensen: Well, he had redone it because then he didn't like it.
[00:15:42] Abby Jorgensen: He said he didn't execute it well and something went wrong.
[00:15:45] Abby Jorgensen: So then we were going to decide based off of his first session, he was above all of his zones.
[00:15:57] Abby Jorgensen: So I was like, I asked him what is scheduled.
[00:16:00] Abby Jorgensen: don't give minutes.
[00:16:00] Abby Jorgensen: And if he was, he wanted to, like, be able to do it again, and we did, but it still looks like he did it late, too, which I don't necessarily like that late, but his schedule is a little all over the place.
[00:16:15] Abby Jorgensen: I can't see him in the spreadsheet.
[00:16:17] Gerard Donnelly: Is he?
[00:16:18] Gerard Donnelly: I don't know if I have.
[00:16:22] Abby Jorgensen: Can you reach out to?
[00:16:24] Abby Jorgensen: Marv.
[00:16:26] Gerard Donnelly: Marv.
[00:16:27] Gerard Donnelly: Or Floyd, doesn't matter.
[00:16:29] Gerard Donnelly: Either one, I'll just put.
[00:16:34] Abby Jorgensen: I'm trying to look for his name.
[00:16:35] Gerard Donnelly: He's not there.
[00:16:38] Abby Jorgensen: His first one was 242, and this one was, like, 252.
[00:16:45] Abby Jorgensen: 252, so 10 watts difference, I think.
[00:16:48] Abby Jorgensen: That's fantastic.
[00:16:49] Gerard Donnelly: It's just, it's really, what is he doing here with 380?
[00:16:55] Abby Jorgensen: That's what I, yeah.
[00:16:57] Abby Jorgensen: I don't know if he loses focus.
[00:16:59] Abby Jorgensen: Is he still?
[00:17:00] Gerard Donnelly: And he up there, that would be the first thing.
[00:17:04] Gerard Donnelly: He's changed gears there.
[00:17:08] Gerard Donnelly: His cadence is really good.
[00:17:11] Abby Jorgensen: He rides a lot, he just isn't used to riding on a trainer.
[00:17:21] Gerard Donnelly: Have you given him some feedback on this, yeah?
[00:17:24] Abby Jorgensen: Yeah, we've talked about it.
[00:17:26] Gerard Donnelly: Yeah, his execution was good.
[00:17:31] Gerard Donnelly: Yeah, it's not terrible.
[00:17:32] Abby Jorgensen: It just has a lot of ups and downs.
[00:17:33] Abby Jorgensen: Yeah, so you've just got to try and get rid of those.
[00:17:38] Gerard Donnelly: That's good.
[00:17:38] Gerard Donnelly: He's got improvement.
[00:17:39] Gerard Donnelly: That's great.
[00:17:40] Gerard Donnelly: And you're thinking like he's coping with the five-minute runs?
[00:17:46] Abby Jorgensen: Yeah, he said, like, even after this morning's run, he was feeling fine.
[00:17:54] Gerard Donnelly: That's good.
[00:17:56] Gerard Donnelly: What's his goal, Abby?
[00:17:57] Gerard Donnelly: I've forgotten.
[00:17:59] Abby Jorgensen: Iron Man.
[00:18:00] Abby Jorgensen: Iron
[00:18:00] Abby Jorgensen: Jacksonville.
[00:18:01] Abby Jorgensen: Next.
[00:18:02] Abby Jorgensen: Yeah.
[00:18:04] Gerard Donnelly: Could you start doing coaching notes again?
[00:18:06] Gerard Donnelly: Great.
[00:18:08] Abby Jorgensen: Great.
[00:18:13] Gerard Donnelly: Well done.
[00:18:15] Gerard Donnelly: Did we make a note last time?
[00:18:17] Abby Jorgensen: No.
[00:18:20] Gerard Donnelly: I just want to hide this note.
[00:18:26] Gerard Donnelly: Ironman what?
[00:18:29] Abby Jorgensen: Jacksonville, Florida.
[00:18:31] Gerard Donnelly: Oh, yeah, Jacksonville.
[00:18:34] Gerard Donnelly: When's that?
[00:18:36] Abby Jorgensen: May.
[00:18:37] Abby Jorgensen: Next May.
[00:18:41] Gerard Donnelly: Yeah.
[00:18:44] Gerard Donnelly: It's not that far away, is it?
[00:18:46] Gerard Donnelly: No, I mean, I'll be here before you know it.
[00:18:49] Abby Jorgensen: Okay.
[00:18:54] Gerard Donnelly: All right.
[00:18:55] Gerard Donnelly: So next week.
[00:18:58] Gerard Donnelly: So how have you been...
[00:19:00] Abby Jorgensen: Jillian, so far you've been doing his – yeah, it's kind of week to week, but it looks like he can fit in depending on when his daughter's volleyball is.
[00:19:13] Abby Jorgensen: That's kind of usually the kicker of when he can do a double.
[00:19:19] Abby Jorgensen: Yeah.
[00:19:21] Gerard Donnelly: Oh, my God, 11 o'clock at night.
[00:19:23] Abby Jorgensen: Yeah, that's why it's like those matches get done.
[00:19:26] Abby Jorgensen: Like one night he texted me like a picture of the match.
[00:19:29] Abby Jorgensen: He's like, we're still going, and it was like, yeah, like 9 o'clock at night, like their time, so.
[00:19:36] Abby Jorgensen: Yeah.
[00:19:41] Gerard Donnelly: So you got him doing three rides, three runs, and two swims, yeah, or three swims.
[00:19:51] Gerard Donnelly: Well, he added an extra one.
[00:19:53] Abby Jorgensen: He just wanted to do some drills one day.
[00:19:55] Abby Jorgensen: had time, so I was like, go do some drills if you want to.
[00:19:59] Gerard Donnelly: Yeah.
[00:20:02] Gerard Donnelly: Okay, so he ran out of time for the bunch ride?
[00:20:07] Abby Jorgensen: Yep.
[00:20:08] Abby Jorgensen: Yep.
[00:20:10] Gerard Donnelly: But generally he's okay, isn't he?
[00:20:12] Abby Jorgensen: Yeah.
[00:20:13] Gerard Donnelly: He's only just started, so.
[00:20:18] Gerard Donnelly: So I think Abby just remind him that it's great to keep practice.
[00:20:23] Gerard Donnelly: Is he a bad swimmer, is he?
[00:20:25] Gerard Donnelly: Yeah, he's not the best.
[00:20:27] Abby Jorgensen: He doesn't have the volume, so like we only did a 500 to start with.
[00:20:34] Gerard Donnelly: Yeah, I'm okay with that, but just remind him that riding is 50% of the event and that we, you know, if we're going to concentrate on one sport, it's going to be doing more riding.
[00:20:52] Gerard Donnelly: So, yeah, we want to make sure that, so this week, this week's different because he's got the 100 miles.
[00:20:58] Gerard Donnelly: So, and then obviously.
[00:21:00] Gerard Donnelly: So he'll have to recover a little bit next week.
[00:21:09] Gerard Donnelly: Yeah, think your running's really good, 20, 30, that's great.
[00:21:13] Gerard Donnelly: Just keep building in like that.
[00:21:18] Gerard Donnelly: So you need to add another run in next week.
[00:21:20] Gerard Donnelly: So you've got two runs.
[00:21:23] Gerard Donnelly: Oh, you've got the third, sorry, take that back.
[00:21:25] Gerard Donnelly: third run.
[00:21:26] Gerard Donnelly: So I'm not sure about scheduling three swims, Abby.
[00:21:31] Gerard Donnelly: I'd be saying two swims, definitely.
[00:21:35] Gerard Donnelly: Okay.
[00:21:36] Gerard Donnelly: And then I'd be doing another.
[00:21:39] Gerard Donnelly: With that short run, I'd be doing another ride, like a Zone 2 ride.
[00:21:47] Gerard Donnelly: If you wanted to creep into Zone 3, that would be okay.
[00:21:52] Gerard Donnelly: But, yeah, I'd be doing, you know, something like, you know, a 50 to...
[00:22:00] Gerard Donnelly: 70-minute ride with a 30-minute run off the bike.
[00:22:04] Gerard Donnelly: On Sunday or Wednesday?
[00:22:06] Abby Jorgensen: Sunday, yeah.
[00:22:08] Gerard Donnelly: And you could do it on Wednesday, depending on what the day that he's got more time.
[00:22:12] Gerard Donnelly: Which day does he have more time?
[00:22:15] Gerard Donnelly: I don't think during the week he's got that much time, has he?
[00:22:17] Abby Jorgensen: Yeah, I would say probably this Sunday.
[00:22:19] Abby Jorgensen: Yeah.
[00:22:20] Gerard Donnelly: Okay, so all the time we want to just keep pushing that, you know, three minimum bikes and four is the goal.
[00:22:28] Gerard Donnelly: Okay?
[00:22:29] Abby Jorgensen: Okay.
[00:22:31] Gerard Donnelly: And tell him the reason why, you know.
[00:22:34] Gerard Donnelly: We don't want to spend equal time in swimming as we do in the riding when swimming's 10% and riding's 50%.
[00:22:44] Gerard Donnelly: If you keep chipping away at the swimming, you know, we've got a long time to get there.
[00:22:50] Gerard Donnelly: We just need you to be fit and efficient.
[00:22:52] Gerard Donnelly: Whereas the bike riding, it's so hard to get you from a two-and-a-half-hour, three-hour rider to a far,-a-half-hour
[00:23:00] Gerard Donnelly: Six-hour rider.
[00:23:02] Gerard Donnelly: You can't just jump from two to three hours to five to six, as you well know, so, okay?
[00:23:11] Gerard Donnelly: Yep.
[00:23:13] Gerard Donnelly: Okay, anything on him?
[00:23:16] Gerard Donnelly: Anything else?
[00:23:17] Gerard Donnelly: Nope.
[00:23:19] Gerard Donnelly: What about Coco?
[00:23:22] Gerard Donnelly: She's good.
[00:23:23] Abby Jorgensen: It took her a little bit to recover from Italy, but she's back on.
[00:23:29] Abby Jorgensen: Yep.
[00:23:35] Gerard Donnelly: So, you're giving her a deload next week.
[00:23:39] Gerard Donnelly: What's your theory there?
[00:23:41] Abby Jorgensen: We haven't tested her FTP in, like, since July.
[00:23:44] Abby Jorgensen: Yes, okay.
[00:23:45] Gerard Donnelly: Yep.
[00:23:52] Gerard Donnelly: Look, she's just done that half marathon two weeks ago, is it?
[00:23:58] Gerard Donnelly: Yes, we'll we'll be back And be We'll Okay.
[00:24:00] Gerard Donnelly: We'll
[00:24:00] Gerard Donnelly: I would be trying to give her a 10k maybe to see.
[00:24:04] Gerard Donnelly: Okay.
[00:24:07] Gerard Donnelly: And if you feel that she's recovered from the race, I'd be giving her a normal Tuesday.
[00:24:16] Gerard Donnelly: FTP Thursday is absolutely fine, but I'd give her some VO2 on the Tuesday.
[00:24:22] Gerard Donnelly: Okay.
[00:24:22] Gerard Donnelly: I wouldn't be calling it a deload week.
[00:24:24] Gerard Donnelly: I'd be saying, yes, we need to test.
[00:24:28] Gerard Donnelly: But you've pretty much had a recovery week this week.
[00:24:31] Gerard Donnelly: No, no, you haven't.
[00:24:33] Gerard Donnelly: You've got a proper week.
[00:24:36] Abby Jorgensen: But she's had a recovery week there.
[00:24:42] Gerard Donnelly: Yeah.
[00:24:43] Gerard Donnelly: I'd be giving her, you know, this Tuesday session, I'd be giving that to her next Tuesday.
[00:24:47] Gerard Donnelly: Okay.
[00:24:48] Gerard Donnelly: I wouldn't, I'd be testing her if you want.
[00:24:50] Gerard Donnelly: Yeah.
[00:24:50] Gerard Donnelly: But I don't know if you needed a swim tester, but definitely FTP tester.
[00:24:55] Gerard Donnelly: And if you wanted to do a 10k run, I wouldn't be giving her a half marathon, especially after.
[00:25:00] Gerard Donnelly: The two weeks after she's just done one in a race.
[00:25:06] Abby Jorgensen: Okay?
[00:25:07] Abby Jorgensen: Yep.
[00:25:23] Gerard Donnelly: She's really good with her injuries, isn't she?
[00:25:25] Gerard Donnelly: She's not struggling at all?
[00:25:28] Gerard Donnelly: Yeah, no, she says she's all good.
[00:25:30] Gerard Donnelly: Yeah, I'd swap that half marathon for a 10k with a big warm-up and a cool-down to get the endurance into her, okay?
[00:25:38] Abby Jorgensen: Yep.
[00:25:39] Gerard Donnelly: You all right with that?
[00:25:40] Gerard Donnelly: Yep.
[00:25:45] Gerard Donnelly: Yep.
[00:25:46] Gerard Donnelly: need these other blocks.
[00:25:49] Gerard Donnelly: That's more an Ironman block, that one.
[00:25:53] Gerard Donnelly: The week of the 13th.
[00:25:58] Abby Jorgensen: 13th.
[00:25:58] Abby Jorgensen: 13th.
[00:25:59] Gerard Donnelly: Yeah.
[00:26:00] Gerard Donnelly: 14th.
[00:26:01] Gerard Donnelly: So just still have...
[00:26:03] Abby Jorgensen: Yeah, week three.
[00:26:05] Abby Jorgensen: Just have week three.
[00:26:08] Gerard Donnelly: So just to recap, this is week one.
[00:26:14] Gerard Donnelly: Last week was week one.
[00:26:17] Gerard Donnelly: Okay.
[00:26:18] Gerard Donnelly: Okay, yep.
[00:26:19] Abby Jorgensen: This week's week two.
[00:26:23] Gerard Donnelly: Next week's week three.
[00:26:26] Gerard Donnelly: And then because you've tested it there, you don't need to...
[00:26:31] Gerard Donnelly: I would give her another week here.
[00:26:35] Gerard Donnelly: And then maybe recovery week.
[00:26:38] Gerard Donnelly: And then how many weeks into my bio?
[00:26:40] Gerard Donnelly: One, two, yep.
[00:26:45] Gerard Donnelly: Let's just go with this, see how she goes.
[00:26:47] Gerard Donnelly: Okay.
[00:26:48] Abby Jorgensen: We're just on that.
[00:26:51] Gerard Donnelly: All right, Dougie?
[00:26:54] Gerard Donnelly: I'm trying to get him on a schedule.
[00:26:57] Abby Jorgensen: Yeah.
[00:26:58] Abby Jorgensen: Um...
[00:26:58] Abby Jorgensen: I talked to him, I'm like, what's your schedule?
[00:27:00] Abby Jorgensen: Look like for he's trying to get trained for that high rocks and also that bike ride.
[00:27:07] Abby Jorgensen: So I was like, all right, give me give me how much time and what he has still has with his rugby that he's doing.
[00:27:15] Abby Jorgensen: So he did that.
[00:27:19] Abby Jorgensen: Today.
[00:27:20] Abby Jorgensen: Yes.
[00:27:26] Abby Jorgensen: What's his event he's training for?
[00:27:28] Abby Jorgensen: Oh, he's going to.
[00:27:31] Abby Jorgensen: He's looking for about two to three different sprints next year because they're going into winter here soon, too.
[00:27:40] Abby Jorgensen: So.
[00:27:41] Gerard Donnelly: So did something different happen in his FTP?
[00:27:45] Gerard Donnelly: Yeah, he didn't.
[00:27:47] Abby Jorgensen: He said he wasn't able to do it.
[00:27:49] Abby Jorgensen: So he just rode.
[00:27:55] Abby Jorgensen: Or it was like he did something.
[00:27:56] Abby Jorgensen: Yeah, I don't know.
[00:27:58] Abby Jorgensen: He said he didn't have time, so he just got out on the bike.
[00:28:00] Abby Jorgensen: God.
[00:28:00] Abby Jorgensen: Okay.
[00:28:00] Abby Jorgensen: And see time.
[00:28:01] Abby Jorgensen: But I don't know why none of the other data came over.
[00:28:07] Gerard Donnelly: So we've got to be super careful that he's not interested in obviously testing and that's what I'm seeing.
[00:28:14] Gerard Donnelly: Is that right?
[00:28:15] Abby Jorgensen: Yeah, mean, he was like, he's like, I wanted to do it.
[00:28:17] Abby Jorgensen: I just didn't have the time or capacity to do it.
[00:28:21] Gerard Donnelly: Well, just when someone doesn't put any power on, there's something going on.
[00:28:25] Gerard Donnelly: But why have you eliminated your power?
[00:28:28] Gerard Donnelly: What did he sort of have an answer for that?
[00:28:35] Abby Jorgensen: I'm trying to remember what he said.
[00:28:37] Abby Jorgensen: Like I said, I don't.
[00:28:42] Gerard Donnelly: Was he happy with the triathlon?
[00:28:44] Abby Jorgensen: Yeah, he he's the one that like he did like 17 minutes faster than he left his last sprint triathlon.
[00:28:57] Abby Jorgensen: He is.
[00:28:57] Abby Jorgensen: He says he is starting a a swift.
[00:29:00] Abby Jorgensen: He's He's trying
[00:29:00] Abby Jorgensen: Racing League on Tuesdays, which I.
[00:29:17] Gerard Donnelly: What's his purpose of doing that?
[00:29:20] Gerard Donnelly: Just something.
[00:29:22] Abby Jorgensen: And I don't know, indoors, he said that could complement.
[00:29:27] Abby Jorgensen: Something for triathlon, that's what he said, Swift Racing League, new on Tuesday evenings.
[00:29:37] Abby Jorgensen: I don't know much about the Swift Racing.
[00:29:43] Gerard Donnelly: Yeah, it's just a Swift race, which we've got no control over.
[00:29:48] Gerard Donnelly: Yeah.
[00:29:50] Gerard Donnelly: A lot of the guys ask me if they can do it, and I say, yeah, but you wouldn't want to be doing that every week.
[00:29:55] Gerard Donnelly: And the trouble is, it's every week, Abby, every week, if you join a team.
[00:30:00] Gerard Donnelly: You're expected to turn up every Tuesday.
[00:30:03] Gerard Donnelly: It just interferes with the whole program.
[00:30:07] Gerard Donnelly: So it's not something I would encourage.
[00:30:10] Gerard Donnelly: It goes away from us being able to give him the proper training program that we want to, because all you're doing is doing a race every Tuesday.
[00:30:20] Gerard Donnelly: And that's great.
[00:30:21] Gerard Donnelly: But if you just keep doing that for three months, you're not getting any stimulus other than the same race every week.
[00:30:32] Gerard Donnelly: And that's the kind of conversation you need to have with him.
[00:30:37] Gerard Donnelly: So, yeah, look, we're okay with that.
[00:30:39] Gerard Donnelly: But you do realize you're not going to get any overload because you're racing the same people every week.
[00:30:45] Gerard Donnelly: You know, it will be good to a point, then it won't be, because you're just doing the same thing.
[00:30:52] Gerard Donnelly: And so, you know, we're unable to give him some VO2 stuff because he's just doing these races.
[00:30:57] Gerard Donnelly: We're unable to, you we have to drop one of the sessions, one of these.
[00:31:00] Gerard Donnelly: One of his high-intensity sessions, we dropped in terms of a race.
[00:31:07] Gerard Donnelly: And I know this is the winter period he's coming into, so we don't want to get too fussy, and we want him to have enjoyment.
[00:31:19] Gerard Donnelly: But as long as you have that conversation, we don't want to do that for six months, because it just really means you're only doing one of our organised sessions.
[00:31:30] Gerard Donnelly: A week, instead of two.
[00:31:33] Gerard Donnelly: Okay.
[00:31:37] Gerard Donnelly: There's also Zwift Endurance races on the weekend that he can do instead, which I'd prefer they did.
[00:31:44] Abby Jorgensen: Okay, Zwift Endurance.
[00:31:46] Abby Jorgensen: Yep.
[00:31:52] Gerard Donnelly: So, you know, just telling you, you've spoken to me, and, you know, on a Saturday or a Sunday, there's lots of races that go between 80 and 100.
[00:32:01] Gerard Donnelly: So, you know, 60 miles to 80 miles that you can do all of, part of, like for example, I did one on Saturday morning, it's 100 kilometers, so what's that, 60 miles, is it?
[00:32:17] Gerard Donnelly: I can't remember, yeah, it's a, yeah, it's a two hour 50 Zwift race, you know, it's really hard, but you're only riding really zone two to zone three the whole time, but that's perfect for it.
[00:32:37] Gerard Donnelly: So, that's, that's a better use of time indoors than, than doing the Zwift racing for the, the, the teams.
[00:32:49] Gerard Donnelly: But anyway, we don't want him to do, you know, another race where he's doing a Tuesday race and a Saturday race, and he's, therefore we've limited him to one training session, you know.
[00:33:02] Gerard Donnelly: Yeah, so we're wanting to have fun with these other things, like, you know, High Rocks is so much different to what we're training for.
[00:33:12] Gerard Donnelly: So, yeah, I just worry that if he starts going down these other tracks, that he doesn't need us anymore.
[00:33:23] Gerard Donnelly: You know, if he hasn't got a real goal for next summer, then he'll be saying, I don't need this program during winter.
[00:33:32] Gerard Donnelly: Do you know what I'm saying?
[00:33:34] Gerard Donnelly: Yeah.
[00:33:35] Abby Jorgensen: I mean, I have him looking for, he's going to look for three to four sprint races next year.
[00:33:43] Abby Jorgensen: Yep, okay.
[00:33:45] Gerard Donnelly: And if we want to improve his running, we want to get him into some 5K park runs and some 10Ks.
[00:33:51] Gerard Donnelly: During the winter.
[00:33:55] Gerard Donnelly: And, yeah, just getting to think about getting another year of really good training.
[00:34:02] Gerard Donnelly: Get that winter period of strength and conditioning on the bike and as a runner, so that when it comes to next summer, he's such a more fitter, prepared athlete.
[00:34:14] Gerard Donnelly: That's the same message for every single athlete who's going into the winter.
[00:34:19] Gerard Donnelly: Exactly the conversation I had with you.
[00:34:22] Gerard Donnelly: Use this opportunity when there's no pressure for triathlon races to really boost your fitness.
[00:34:28] Gerard Donnelly: And most of the athletes think about it the other way.
[00:34:30] Gerard Donnelly: They think, oh, there's no races.
[00:34:32] Gerard Donnelly: There's no pressure on me, so I don't need to be so keen on training.
[00:34:36] Gerard Donnelly: It's the wrong way to think.
[00:34:39] Gerard Donnelly: You know, this is the time to get better rather than getting less structured.
[00:34:48] Gerard Donnelly: Okay?
[00:34:49] Abby Jorgensen: Yep.
[00:34:50] Gerard Donnelly: Andrew, Booth?
[00:34:53] Gerard Donnelly: He's good.
[00:34:55] Abby Jorgensen: Everything's starting to feel back to normal for him.
[00:34:58] Abby Jorgensen: Yep.
[00:34:58] Abby Jorgensen: After the crash.
[00:34:59] Abby Jorgensen: So, like, today was...
[00:35:01] Abby Jorgensen: First time, the swim felt normal.
[00:35:04] Abby Jorgensen: Yeah, great.
[00:35:05] Gerard Donnelly: He just had a meeting.
[00:35:06] Gerard Donnelly: had to cut it short.
[00:35:08] Abby Jorgensen: Yep.
[00:35:10] Abby Jorgensen: But, yeah, other than that, he got outside and rode last weekend.
[00:35:14] Abby Jorgensen: Or this, yeah.
[00:35:15] Abby Jorgensen: Yep.
[00:35:16] Abby Jorgensen: So, and then he did an actual, like, half marathon and then ran extra.
[00:35:23] Abby Jorgensen: There was, like, a half marathon he jumped into.
[00:35:26] Gerard Donnelly: Yep.
[00:35:29] Gerard Donnelly: Well, that's good.
[00:35:35] Gerard Donnelly: Okay, so he went running and then he joined the race.
[00:35:38] Abby Jorgensen: Yeah.
[00:35:39] Abby Jorgensen: Fantastic.
[00:35:40] Abby Jorgensen: It was, like, put on by his work or something, so he felt obligated.
[00:35:44] Abby Jorgensen: Yeah, that's really good.
[00:35:48] Gerard Donnelly: Okay.
[00:35:49] Gerard Donnelly: And he got his big ride in on Sunday.
[00:35:52] Abby Jorgensen: Yep.
[00:35:55] Gerard Donnelly: Is that a hilly course that he's doing?
[00:35:58] Gerard Donnelly: No.
[00:35:59] Gerard Donnelly: Yep, okay.
[00:36:02] Gerard Donnelly: I mean, it looks like it, but it's really not.
[00:36:04] Abby Jorgensen: Yep.
[00:36:08] Gerard Donnelly: Is he feeling like he's handling the load?
[00:36:13] Abby Jorgensen: Yeah, he said, like, the ride, the first ride outside here that he did, he's like, I know the power wasn't probably where we need it, but he's like, it felt, he's like, I wasn't, like, super tired later in the day, and it's, like, the first time I felt like I was able to.
[00:36:32] Abby Jorgensen: Get it all in.
[00:36:33] Abby Jorgensen: Great, that's good for him this week, that's great.
[00:36:36] Abby Jorgensen: Yeah, and then he'll be, next weekend he comes, he actually comes back to Des Moines, and so we're going to swim on Monday together, we don't know if we'll do a pool, or we might try open water, because it's still, it's still like 90 degrees here today.
[00:36:50] Gerard Donnelly: Yeah, the more open waters you can get him to do before Florida, the better.
[00:36:54] Gerard Donnelly: Yeah.
[00:36:56] Abby Jorgensen: Florida will be ocean, but.
[00:36:58] Abby Jorgensen: Yep.
[00:36:59] Abby Jorgensen: We, we don't have that here.
[00:37:01] Abby Jorgensen: Yep.
[00:37:04] Gerard Donnelly: Just some of these, between now and Florida, Abby, he needs to have a long ride, long run, today.
[00:37:11] Gerard Donnelly: Have you got one?
[00:37:15] Gerard Donnelly: There's one there.
[00:37:20] Gerard Donnelly: Yep.
[00:37:33] Gerard Donnelly: Yeah, this weekend's run, can you make that a bit further?
[00:37:37] Abby Jorgensen: Yeah.
[00:37:38] Abby Jorgensen: Yep.
[00:37:39] Abby Jorgensen: Can you cope with that, two and a half?
[00:37:42] Abby Jorgensen: He should be able to, yeah.
[00:37:44] Abby Jorgensen: I mean, he did.
[00:37:45] Abby Jorgensen: Yep, 320 last week.
[00:37:49] Gerard Donnelly: Okay, good.
[00:37:51] Gerard Donnelly: Cindy's still off, is she?
[00:37:52] Gerard Donnelly: Yeah, as far as I know.
[00:37:55] Abby Jorgensen: I saw her do a ride on Strava, but it was a short ride.
[00:37:59] Abby Jorgensen: Yep.
[00:38:02] Gerard Donnelly: Yeah, okay.
[00:38:05] Gerard Donnelly: Isabella?
[00:38:09] Abby Jorgensen: We are – she's doing that Melbourne marathon.
[00:38:19] Abby Jorgensen: So, yeah, we're to get through this week and then taper next week.
[00:38:23] Abby Jorgensen: I have a call with her on Thursday to try to cover a few things nutrition-wise.
[00:38:30] Abby Jorgensen: Yeah, great.
[00:38:35] Gerard Donnelly: She's pretty – she's not that prepared for her, she?
[00:38:38] Abby Jorgensen: I mean, probably not, no.
[00:38:41] Abby Jorgensen: But she was – she went and took somebody's spot or somebody was offering it and she took it and then told me.
[00:38:49] Abby Jorgensen: So, you know how that goes.
[00:38:52] Abby Jorgensen: It's not your fault.
[00:38:52] Abby Jorgensen: It's just classic her.
[00:38:55] Abby Jorgensen: I mean, she is getting on the bike, so we'll give her that.
[00:38:58] Abby Jorgensen: Yep.
[00:38:59] Abby Jorgensen: Yeah.
[00:39:00] Abby Jorgensen: No, you've – You've turned
[00:39:01] Abby Jorgensen: Put her around.
[00:39:01] Abby Jorgensen: That's great.
[00:39:04] Gerard Donnelly: She's going to be really struggling after the Melbourne Marathon.
[00:39:06] Gerard Donnelly: She needs a good two or three weeks of just easy training, especially that first week.
[00:39:14] Gerard Donnelly: She's going to be so knocked around from this race.
[00:39:23] Abby Jorgensen: What's that course like?
[00:39:24] Abby Jorgensen: Is it pretty flat?
[00:39:25] Abby Jorgensen: Or is it?
[00:39:26] Gerard Donnelly: It's always going to be windy, so it's going to have a big wind issue.
[00:39:30] Gerard Donnelly: Jordan's doing the same race.
[00:39:31] Gerard Donnelly: Yeah.
[00:39:33] Gerard Donnelly: But then at the end, Abby, they come up St Kilda Road, which is the main road through Melbourne, and instead of going into the finish, they turn right and go up through some hills in the last 3km.
[00:39:45] Gerard Donnelly: It's really cruel.
[00:39:47] Gerard Donnelly: So you think you're going okay, then you have to run up in the hills.
[00:39:53] Gerard Donnelly: So you're going to need to tell her that.
[00:39:56] Gerard Donnelly: It's called the TAN.
[00:39:58] Gerard Donnelly: They send you into the TAN, which is the...
[00:40:01] Gerard Donnelly: It's called the Botanical Gardens, and the TAN is short for Botanical, so it's the famous running venue for all the runners in Melbourne, they run around the TAN, or they used to say, let's go running around the Botanical Gardens, now they say, let's go running around the TAN, and it runs up the TAN, up to the highest point, near Government House, and then comes back down, so it's quite up, and then it's quite back down, so it's a bit of a, other than that, it's really windy and flat.
[00:40:28] Gerard Donnelly: And the weather in Melbourne can be anything, it can be 16, or it can be 26, it's just so, in spring, it's just so, all over the place.
[00:40:43] Gerard Donnelly: That's here too, that's fine.
[00:40:46] Abby Jorgensen: It's supposed to be fall, but it's summer now, still.
[00:40:51] Gerard Donnelly: How's Kevin going, our Scandinavian man?
[00:40:54] Abby Jorgensen: He's good, his pedals are supposed to be here Wednesday.
[00:40:59] Abby Jorgensen: Yep.
[00:41:00] Abby Jorgensen: So.
[00:41:01] Abby Jorgensen: It's not stopping him, is it?
[00:41:03] Abby Jorgensen: Uh-uh.
[00:41:04] Abby Jorgensen: No, yeah, he's doing a...
[00:41:06] Abby Jorgensen: As long as he's not traveling.
[00:41:08] Gerard Donnelly: Yeah.
[00:41:10] Gerard Donnelly: Jeez, so he's going outside.
[00:41:12] Gerard Donnelly: Oof.
[00:41:13] Gerard Donnelly: Come on.
[00:41:14] Abby Jorgensen: Is it cold there right now, or...
[00:41:16] Abby Jorgensen: don't think...
[00:41:16] Abby Jorgensen: It seems plain too much, but...
[00:41:21] Gerard Donnelly: It's 10 degrees, and so that's like 30.
[00:41:25] Gerard Donnelly: Oh, no thank you.
[00:41:27] Abby Jorgensen: Yeah.
[00:41:28] Abby Jorgensen: I have like a limit.
[00:41:30] Abby Jorgensen: Maybe Jesse.
[00:41:36] Gerard Donnelly: But is he...
[00:41:37] Gerard Donnelly: You happy with him?
[00:41:38] Gerard Donnelly: Yeah, he's...
[00:41:40] Abby Jorgensen: I mean, he communicates well, and then, yeah, he does everything I ask of him.
[00:41:45] Abby Jorgensen: So.
[00:41:48] Abby Jorgensen: Actually, 10's 50.
[00:41:49] Gerard Donnelly: 10's 50 degrees.
[00:41:51] Gerard Donnelly: Oh, okay.
[00:41:52] Abby Jorgensen: That's manageable.
[00:41:54] Abby Jorgensen: Manageable.
[00:41:56] Gerard Donnelly: What's Kevin's goal?
[00:41:58] Gerard Donnelly: Oh, God.
[00:41:58] Gerard Donnelly: You've got to keep writing these goals down.
[00:42:05] Abby Jorgensen: It's a year, isn't it?
[00:42:07] Abby Jorgensen: Ironman and a year's time.
[00:42:08] Abby Jorgensen: Yeah, that's an Ironman way down the road.
[00:42:12] Abby Jorgensen: Yeah.
[00:42:19] Abby Jorgensen: He's been injured there, hasn't he?
[00:42:21] Abby Jorgensen: Yeah, he can't run yet.
[00:42:22] Abby Jorgensen: He just saw his PT, and the PT says to hold off still.
[00:42:26] Abby Jorgensen: mean, it's improving, but the PT wants to hold off, so.
[00:42:30] Abby Jorgensen: Yeah.
[00:42:35] Gerard Donnelly: Yeah, that's good.
[00:42:37] Gerard Donnelly: You're giving him five bike sessions and two swims.
[00:42:40] Gerard Donnelly: Great.
[00:42:41] Gerard Donnelly: Six, three swims.
[00:42:43] Gerard Donnelly: Three swims, yeah.
[00:42:45] Abby Jorgensen: And then he wanted some strength, so I added that too.
[00:42:49] Abby Jorgensen: Yeah.
[00:42:49] Gerard Donnelly: If you find on Wednesday it's too wet, make sure you give him another option with the recovery ride indoor, okay?
[00:42:58] Gerard Donnelly: Okay.
[00:42:59] Gerard Donnelly: And if you find it Saturday is going to be Wednesday.
[00:43:01] Gerard Donnelly: Just don't forget to give him another option.
[00:43:04] Gerard Donnelly: You know in the library there's a Zwift Endurance.
[00:43:12] Gerard Donnelly: You see that?
[00:43:14] Gerard Donnelly: When you open it up, so if you're wanting to ride 3.30, so you want it basically to ride three hours with intensity or without intensity.
[00:43:23] Gerard Donnelly: So I've got both.
[00:43:25] Gerard Donnelly: So no intensity with intensity.
[00:43:27] Gerard Donnelly: You see that?
[00:43:27] Gerard Donnelly: So just put that there and if you open it up, it'll say select any Zwift Endurance ride that's around 80, 220k or three hours plus.
[00:43:38] Gerard Donnelly: Look for a solid ride with undulations, consistent pressure on the pedal.
[00:43:41] Gerard Donnelly: So it's a really good session, a general session for them to have.
[00:43:45] Gerard Donnelly: And so they need to go and select an Endurance.
[00:43:47] Gerard Donnelly: That's the one I was talking about for, who were we talking about before?
[00:43:52] Gerard Donnelly: Dougie.
[00:43:53] Gerard Donnelly: Dougie, yeah.
[00:43:54] Gerard Donnelly: So that's an option.
[00:43:56] Gerard Donnelly: Remember they're there.
[00:43:57] Gerard Donnelly: Hopefully you've got them in your library.
[00:43:59] Gerard Donnelly: There's 17 of them.
[00:44:00] Gerard Donnelly: Zwift Endurance.
[00:44:00] Gerard Donnelly: about one of can't faut I Europe It's
[00:44:01] Gerard Donnelly: Wait, check.
[00:44:02] Gerard Donnelly: I'm pretty sure I've seen that one.
[00:44:14] Abby Jorgensen: Yeah, yep, I got it.
[00:44:16] Abby Jorgensen: Good.
[00:44:20] Gerard Donnelly: Okay.
[00:44:22] Gerard Donnelly: Well, any questions on him?
[00:44:25] Gerard Donnelly: Nope.
[00:44:26] Abby Jorgensen: Richard?
[00:44:29] Abby Jorgensen: He's doing pretty good.
[00:44:31] Abby Jorgensen: Um, we're still, uh, he does his sessions late, so he's still easing back into the swim, and then, uh, bike, and then we're, um, took a break from running.
[00:44:46] Abby Jorgensen: His physical therapist wanted a break because his calf is seizing up on him, so we took a break from running for a second.
[00:44:54] Gerard Donnelly: Well, he's nyling the box sessions, so that's good.
[00:44:57] Abby Jorgensen: Yeah, I even had, like, we had a conversation because his FTP went up.
[00:45:01] Abby Jorgensen: then...
[00:45:01] Abby Jorgensen: ...
[00:45:01] Abby Jorgensen: ...
[00:45:01] Abby Jorgensen: ...
[00:45:01] Abby Jorgensen: And he was struggling to hit some numbers, so I decreased the percentage a little bit.
[00:45:07] Gerard Donnelly: And you're going to test this week?
[00:45:10] Gerard Donnelly: Yep.
[00:45:12] Gerard Donnelly: And is he getting instruction in those swim lessons?
[00:45:16] Abby Jorgensen: They're just, since his bicep is not fully, like, ready to swim, he's just testing it out.
[00:45:21] Abby Jorgensen: So he's just doing some things to feel it out.
[00:45:25] Abby Jorgensen: Yep.
[00:45:27] Abby Jorgensen: What's he training for again?
[00:45:30] Abby Jorgensen: At the moment, he was going to do Morro Bay in November, but he thinks he's going to X that for now because of, like, his running and swimming aren't quite right there.
[00:45:43] Abby Jorgensen: So he wants to stick with Olympic distance come next year.
[00:45:50] Abby Jorgensen: So he has some races in mind, but nothing like solid concrete.
[00:45:55] Abby Jorgensen: Yep.
[00:45:56] Abby Jorgensen: Yep.
[00:45:56] Gerard Donnelly: Same message, use the winter period to really build just strength and
[00:46:01] Gerard Donnelly: Yeah, that's what he wants.
[00:46:04] Abby Jorgensen: He had been doing sprints, and he's like, do you think I'm capable of Olympic?
[00:46:08] Abby Jorgensen: And I'm like, yeah, like, you're already doing the, like, you can do all the sprints already, so that's not an issue.
[00:46:14] Abby Jorgensen: Great.
[00:46:15] Gerard Donnelly: Well, just try to push a few more bike sessions into him, if you can.
[00:46:18] Gerard Donnelly: Okay.
[00:46:20] Gerard Donnelly: I know you've got five there, but that's a bit of a deload week, is it?
[00:46:28] Abby Jorgensen: Yeah, because we're testing.
[00:46:31] Abby Jorgensen: So that's good.
[00:46:32] Gerard Donnelly: You've already given him strength efforts plus 4020s, coffee ride, coffee ride, and endurance ride, which is – was he indoors there, was he?
[00:46:47] Gerard Donnelly: He might have tried to go outside.
[00:46:49] Abby Jorgensen: He hasn't – like, he was – Yeah, he's indoors.
[00:46:52] Gerard Donnelly: It's resorted to an FTP test.
[00:46:56] Gerard Donnelly: Oh, yeah.
[00:46:57] Gerard Donnelly: He texted me that.
[00:46:58] Abby Jorgensen: He's like, I don't know why.
[00:46:59] Abby Jorgensen: Okay.
[00:46:59] Abby Jorgensen: If it's –
[00:47:01] Abby Jorgensen: Came over, he's like, I stopped it, obviously, and then just kept, because I think if you scroll down, there's another session.
[00:47:09] Abby Jorgensen: Yep.
[00:47:09] Abby Jorgensen: Yeah.
[00:47:10] Abby Jorgensen: He started again.
[00:47:11] Abby Jorgensen: Yep, okay.
[00:47:12] Gerard Donnelly: And don't forget, we've got the endurance, you know, the wet weather endurance.
[00:47:16] Gerard Donnelly: We've got those five.
[00:47:20] Gerard Donnelly: And then we've got the other 28 endurance ones indoors.
[00:47:25] Gerard Donnelly: So if you're in doubt for anybody, just give them, you know, the Zwift endurance race, these endurance training peak sessions, or the outdoor endurance ride.
[00:47:37] Gerard Donnelly: So you could well have three loaded sessions.
[00:47:40] Gerard Donnelly: So, I mean, you've got it here already.
[00:47:43] Gerard Donnelly: Yeah.
[00:47:44] Gerard Donnelly: But if, you know, just keep, you need to know each athlete.
[00:47:47] Gerard Donnelly: Can they ride outside if they can?
[00:47:49] Gerard Donnelly: And it all of a sudden turns wet on them.
[00:47:52] Gerard Donnelly: You're not supposed to know whether it's wet in London or Norway or, you know, Australia or, you can't be.
[00:48:01] Gerard Donnelly: Be across every weather.
[00:48:03] Gerard Donnelly: So just to cover yourself, Abby, you know, just say outdoor or indoor or training peaks or Zwift or whatever.
[00:48:10] Gerard Donnelly: Just keep putting or.
[00:48:12] Abby Jorgensen: Yeah.
[00:48:12] Abby Jorgensen: Just always.
[00:48:13] Abby Jorgensen: He's indoors right now because of the bicep.
[00:48:15] Abby Jorgensen: He can't.
[00:48:16] Abby Jorgensen: He doesn't want to risk going outside.
[00:48:18] Abby Jorgensen: Yeah.
[00:48:18] Abby Jorgensen: You know your athletes.
[00:48:20] Abby Jorgensen: So.
[00:48:20] Abby Jorgensen: He was going to try to be outside soon, but he was in California, so he can be outside.
[00:48:28] Abby Jorgensen: That's true.
[00:48:29] Abby Jorgensen: Anything else on him?
[00:48:30] Abby Jorgensen: Nope.
[00:48:32] Abby Jorgensen: Michaela, how's she recovering?
[00:48:34] Gerard Donnelly: Yeah.
[00:48:34] Gerard Donnelly: She said she felt good today.
[00:48:36] Abby Jorgensen: think she had a swim.
[00:48:38] Abby Jorgensen: Yeah.
[00:48:41] Abby Jorgensen: But yeah, we're going to.
[00:48:43] Abby Jorgensen: She's got a couple Olympics and then she's going to do the Sydney one again next.
[00:48:51] Abby Jorgensen: She said, right?
[00:48:53] Abby Jorgensen: Is it early this year?
[00:48:54] Abby Jorgensen: Early next year?
[00:48:55] Abby Jorgensen: Oh, I didn't know that.
[00:48:57] Gerard Donnelly: Sorry.
[00:48:58] Gerard Donnelly: She's like, she's like, I want the redemption.
[00:49:00] Abby Jorgensen: And I was like, okay.
[00:49:01] Abby Jorgensen: okay.
[00:49:01] Abby Jorgensen: Yeah.
[00:49:01] Abby Jorgensen: So next September, she's like, no, they moved it to May.
[00:49:07] Abby Jorgensen: Wow.
[00:49:08] Abby Jorgensen: So, yeah, I don't know.
[00:49:09] Abby Jorgensen: That's interesting.
[00:49:10] Abby Jorgensen: Yeah.
[00:49:14] Gerard Donnelly: I'm just going to hide that.
[00:49:17] Gerard Donnelly: Good.
[00:49:18] Gerard Donnelly: All right.
[00:49:19] Gerard Donnelly: And has she got some local races she can do?
[00:49:24] Abby Jorgensen: Yes.
[00:49:25] Abby Jorgensen: Yeah, it's an Olympic and then a sprint.
[00:49:27] Abby Jorgensen: Like an Olympic, I think it's still in New Zealand, but she has to travel and then one in her hometown sprint or something.
[00:49:37] Abby Jorgensen: Yep.
[00:49:38] Abby Jorgensen: All right.
[00:49:39] Gerard Donnelly: Anything else on her?
[00:49:40] Abby Jorgensen: No.
[00:49:41] Gerard Donnelly: Anything you're worried about with any athlete, please yell out.
[00:49:45] Gerard Donnelly: Yeah.
[00:49:49] Gerard Donnelly: Rihanna, the least consistent athlete I've ever seen in my life.
[00:49:53] Gerard Donnelly: Right.
[00:49:54] Gerard Donnelly: Yeah.
[00:49:55] Abby Jorgensen: Like she, if look at her half marathon times, she somehow.
[00:50:01] Abby Jorgensen: I Yeah.
[00:50:01] Abby Jorgensen: I.
[00:50:02] Abby Jorgensen: It's really not that bad.
[00:50:05] Abby Jorgensen: She's done traveling, except for this weekend, they're going back home home real quick.
[00:50:12] Abby Jorgensen: But she's like, I want to do an FTP and I want to start to get serious now that travel is over with.
[00:50:21] Abby Jorgensen: Her execution was horrible.
[00:50:26] Abby Jorgensen: She doesn't have to run it for fun.
[00:50:29] Abby Jorgensen: She's like, we just party paced it.
[00:50:31] Gerard Donnelly: I know, but even then, you want to, why would you do that to yourself?
[00:50:35] Gerard Donnelly: Literally, she ran the first half a minute per kilometer faster than the second half.
[00:50:41] Gerard Donnelly: Like, it's just, I just don't know why you would do that.
[00:50:47] Gerard Donnelly: She was 6.42 pace and she's run the first half in 5.50, 5.
[00:50:58] Gerard Donnelly: Just to say.
[00:51:01] Abby Jorgensen: And I just let her kind of do it because I didn't want her to do it because obviously she hasn't been training.
[00:51:08] Abby Jorgensen: But her and her fiance were determined just they've already paid for it and they were going to just go and do it and then do it.
[00:51:16] Gerard Donnelly: Yeah, I think some of your athletes, if it's too vague, get a meeting with them to say, look, we're going to plan out this winter leading into summer.
[00:51:28] Gerard Donnelly: What are our goals?
[00:51:29] Gerard Donnelly: What, you know, and in the stepping stones over winter, let's pick some running races we can do that are actually in our program that we don't want to get a surprise from.
[00:51:40] Gerard Donnelly: Do you know what mean?
[00:51:40] Gerard Donnelly: It's hard to coach someone who says, oh, by the way, I've entered this race, you know, like Isabella did.
[00:51:49] Gerard Donnelly: You know, it's infuriating if you've to coach someone properly because you know that they're not going to get the best out of themselves because you haven't planned that.
[00:51:59] Abby Jorgensen: Mm-hmm.
[00:52:01] Gerard Donnelly: So try to get into each athlete and start making notes at the start of them and hide them for me.
[00:52:09] Gerard Donnelly: So what is the discussion I've had with this athlete?
[00:52:14] Gerard Donnelly: Autumn is like the change of, you know, what are we doing for the next autumn-winter period?
[00:52:19] Gerard Donnelly: And spring's the same in Australia.
[00:52:21] Gerard Donnelly: What are we doing for the next summer period?
[00:52:23] Gerard Donnelly: So I'm having conversations now with all my athletes going, right, what races are you thinking of doing if they haven't already thought it through?
[00:52:29] Gerard Donnelly: So over – because all our races are now Abby, November, December, January, February, March, April.
[00:52:33] Gerard Donnelly: That's all our races are.
[00:52:35] Gerard Donnelly: For you, it's the winter period.
[00:52:37] Gerard Donnelly: Like, you know, what are we going to work on in winter?
[00:52:40] Gerard Donnelly: Are you lacking in the endurance on the bike?
[00:52:42] Gerard Donnelly: Have you got a good ability to absorb the running load?
[00:52:45] Gerard Donnelly: Do we need to keep extending your running duration?
[00:52:49] Gerard Donnelly: Have you got some 5 and 10K and half marathons that we could kick over the winter period?
[00:52:54] Gerard Donnelly: You know, not all of your athletes are going into winter.
[00:52:57] Gerard Donnelly: You've got some in summer, obviously, Michaela.
[00:52:59] Gerard Donnelly: I'm going as an example.
[00:53:00] Gerard Donnelly: But – I'm
[00:53:01] Gerard Donnelly: But, yeah, try to prevent the haphazardness of athletes' randomness in their goal setting.
[00:53:10] Gerard Donnelly: That's kind of what I'm trying to say for everybody you're coaching, you know.
[00:53:14] Abby Jorgensen: That's great.
[00:53:14] Gerard Donnelly: It's great for Diana saying, I want to do an FTP test.
[00:53:17] Gerard Donnelly: I want to see where I'm at.
[00:53:18] Gerard Donnelly: That's brilliant.
[00:53:20] Gerard Donnelly: But make sure we're testing on the right bike, in the TT position, using the right power meter.
[00:53:24] Gerard Donnelly: You know, because she just hasn't trained properly since we've started.
[00:53:28] Gerard Donnelly: So, you know, if you and I scroll back, it's just all red.
[00:53:32] Gerard Donnelly: You know, there's literally three weeks of some good training, and then you just see more reds.
[00:53:41] Gerard Donnelly: You know, all of a sudden she gets a run on, and then there's a big patch of more reds.
[00:53:49] Gerard Donnelly: So it's easy to let them do what they want, but we want to have a part of that happen, that they're happy doing what they want.
[00:53:58] Gerard Donnelly: We want that, but it has to be guided.
[00:54:00] Gerard Donnelly: That's all.
[00:54:02] Gerard Donnelly: Are okay with that?
[00:54:03] Gerard Donnelly: Yep.
[00:54:05] Abby Jorgensen: Blair?
[00:54:07] Gerard Donnelly: He's good.
[00:54:09] Abby Jorgensen: We just tested last week with him, and then we are starting kind of a – because he's Ironman Canada next.
[00:54:17] Abby Jorgensen: Yes.
[00:54:19] Abby Jorgensen: August, I think.
[00:54:21] Abby Jorgensen: So he's got a long time, yeah.
[00:54:22] Gerard Donnelly: Yeah, so I was like, we're just going to kind of build your fitness.
[00:54:28] Abby Jorgensen: Yep.
[00:54:29] Abby Jorgensen: And he's good with that.
[00:54:30] Abby Jorgensen: He's ready to work, he said.
[00:54:33] Gerard Donnelly: Yep, so he just did 2.18, Abby.
[00:54:38] Gerard Donnelly: I'm looking at his data.
[00:54:42] Gerard Donnelly: Yeah.
[00:54:43] Abby Jorgensen: Is that right in June?
[00:54:45] Gerard Donnelly: Is that his last FTP in June?
[00:54:47] Gerard Donnelly: He did 1.80?
[00:54:49] Gerard Donnelly: Has he gone up 40?
[00:54:50] Gerard Donnelly: What?
[00:54:52] Abby Jorgensen: Is that right?
[00:54:53] Abby Jorgensen: He did that huge bike ride, so we did a lot of biking.
[00:54:57] Abby Jorgensen: Yeah.
[00:54:58] Abby Jorgensen: It still has – I feel like it still has room to
[00:55:03] Abby Jorgensen: And especially when he smashed that last.
[00:55:07] Gerard Donnelly: So when they're doing that, I get worried when they jump 40 watts that something's not right, whether his power meter, he's using the wrong power meter, he's using the kicker, or are you confirming every time they do this with them?
[00:55:22] Abby Jorgensen: Yeah, because I know last time he said that the kicker power, he had, like, one of the first times we tested.
[00:55:34] Abby Jorgensen: So now it's, he's like, I made sure that.
[00:55:42] Gerard Donnelly: Yep.
[00:55:42] Gerard Donnelly: All right, well, that's happy days.
[00:55:44] Gerard Donnelly: It's a huge jump.
[00:55:46] Abby Jorgensen: Yeah, his 5k was also really improvement as well.
[00:55:57] Gerard Donnelly: So his last 5k in June was 21.57, is that right?
[00:56:01] Gerard Donnelly: last 5k bit.
[00:56:01] Gerard Donnelly: you.
[00:56:03] Abby Jorgensen: Yeah, want to say it was like a 40, a 50 minute, or a 50 second PR.
[00:56:10] Gerard Donnelly: 21.37.
[00:56:12] Gerard Donnelly: Yeah, 20 second, 20 second PR.
[00:56:15] Gerard Donnelly: And just message Marv that it's not in TrainingPeaks.
[00:56:23] Abby Jorgensen: Okay.
[00:56:24] Gerard Donnelly: I mean, it's not in the spreadsheet.
[00:56:26] Gerard Donnelly: I didn't mean to say TrainingPeaks, sorry.
[00:56:31] Gerard Donnelly: That was last Saturday, wasn't it?
[00:56:34] Abby Jorgensen: Yeah.
[00:56:36] Gerard Donnelly: Is he swimming there?
[00:56:38] Gerard Donnelly: Yes, he swims in there.
[00:56:40] Gerard Donnelly: Yeah, just message him.
[00:56:50] Gerard Donnelly: That's good.
[00:56:52] Gerard Donnelly: His swim was a bit slower.
[00:56:58] Gerard Donnelly: 2.08, please.
[00:57:00] Gerard Donnelly: He said he felt...
[00:57:01] Abby Jorgensen: They said it felt fine.
[00:57:05] Abby Jorgensen: I mean.
[00:57:06] Abby Jorgensen: Yep.
[00:57:08] Abby Jorgensen: Yep.
[00:57:10] Gerard Donnelly: Well, that's a good bike and good run.
[00:57:13] Gerard Donnelly: That's really good.
[00:57:13] Gerard Donnelly: Well done.
[00:57:22] Gerard Donnelly: How is his running coming along?
[00:57:25] Gerard Donnelly: He hasn't run a whole lot, so I don't want to.
[00:57:28] Abby Jorgensen: Is it from the injury?
[00:57:29] Abby Jorgensen: Yeah.
[00:57:30] Abby Jorgensen: Yeah, because he had some Achilles issues after his 70.3, so we took a little break from running.
[00:57:39] Abby Jorgensen: Yep.
[00:57:43] Gerard Donnelly: So just keep doing what you're doing with the shorter runs.
[00:57:47] Gerard Donnelly: Is he able to run off the bike, is he?
[00:57:50] Abby Jorgensen: Yes, someday.
[00:57:53] Abby Jorgensen: Usually during the week he has one day that he can fit in a shorter run.
[00:57:59] Gerard Donnelly: Yep.
[00:58:00] Gerard Donnelly: I would get in.
[00:58:01] Gerard Donnelly: Do another short run off here, 15 minutes off the long ride, just to get that extra run in.
[00:58:06] Abby Jorgensen: Okay.
[00:58:11] Gerard Donnelly: Okay.
[00:58:13] Gerard Donnelly: Glenn Hendricks.
[00:58:19] Abby Jorgensen: We're doing pretty good.
[00:58:21] Abby Jorgensen: had a rough week last week, just feeling tired, and he said it's getting hot there in Bali again.
[00:58:30] Abby Jorgensen: And so we're just trying, I'm trying to get him to understand that he needs to fuel more, because he was, I don't know, he was only about at 50 to 60 grams an hour.
[00:58:39] Abby Jorgensen: And I was like, you need way more than that.
[00:58:47] Gerard Donnelly: Yeah, that's something that he shouldn't, you shouldn't have to have that conversation.
[00:58:51] Abby Jorgensen: Yeah.
[00:58:54] Gerard Donnelly: He did a good 60-minute, Abby.
[00:58:56] Gerard Donnelly: Far out.
[00:58:58] Gerard Donnelly: And what was his 10K like?
[00:59:00] Abby Jorgensen: Ah.
[00:59:01] Abby Jorgensen: I didn't think it was bad.
[00:59:03] Abby Jorgensen: He always wants to be a faster runner, but.
[00:59:06] Abby Jorgensen: That's his PB.
[00:59:08] Abby Jorgensen: Yeah, I mean, I was like, you PB'd, so I don't know why you're complaining.
[00:59:13] Abby Jorgensen: I don't know.
[00:59:13] Abby Jorgensen: He just always has these higher expectations, I think.
[00:59:16] Abby Jorgensen: So sometimes I have to bring him back down to, like, hey.
[00:59:21] Abby Jorgensen: Well, make sure you do.
[00:59:22] Gerard Donnelly: Yeah.
[00:59:23] Abby Jorgensen: He's very, he has all these very, very high expectations, and I.
[00:59:29] Abby Jorgensen: That's a two-minute improvement.
[00:59:30] Gerard Donnelly: For God's sake.
[00:59:32] Gerard Donnelly: Yeah.
[00:59:33] Abby Jorgensen: Yeah, mean, his running has been really good, I think.
[00:59:37] Abby Jorgensen: And he's 60-minute.
[00:59:38] Gerard Donnelly: He's gone from 34 k's an hour.
[00:59:41] Gerard Donnelly: Oh, that was indoor.
[00:59:44] Gerard Donnelly: Yeah, we finally got him to do a proper outdoor.
[00:59:47] Abby Jorgensen: That was great.
[00:59:48] Abby Jorgensen: I told him to message Jordan, too, and, like, I was like, you got to find a good route, because with all this Ironman stuff, I need you outdoors.
[00:59:57] Abby Jorgensen: It's just possible.
[00:59:58] Abby Jorgensen: I know the roads are terrible, but.
[01:00:01] Gerard Donnelly: Are you looking at his spreadsheet, Abby?
[01:00:03] Gerard Donnelly: Can you jump on there?
[01:00:04] Gerard Donnelly: Can you jump on his spreadsheet?
[01:00:06] Gerard Donnelly: Yep.
[01:00:07] Abby Jorgensen: Glenn, Glenn.
[01:00:12] Abby Jorgensen: Yep.
[01:00:13] Gerard Donnelly: Can you see, like, he's run 4.22 for the first half and 4.11.
[01:00:20] Gerard Donnelly: That's absolutely brilliant.
[01:00:22] Gerard Donnelly: I mean, running 4.11, you know, I would be just jumping for joy with that result.
[01:00:29] Gerard Donnelly: You know, he can really challenge himself to start at, you know, 4.15s, if you wanted to, which is, you know, when he first started with this, he was running a nearly five-minute K pace.
[01:00:43] Gerard Donnelly: You know, he's run 49, 48, 44, 42.
[01:00:48] Gerard Donnelly: He's improved seven minutes in the space of nine months.
[01:00:54] Gerard Donnelly: Wow.
[01:00:54] Gerard Donnelly: You need to point these things out to him, okay?
[01:00:56] Gerard Donnelly: Okay.
[01:00:57] Gerard Donnelly: Yep.
[01:01:00] Gerard Donnelly: And even...
[01:01:03] Gerard Donnelly: The 60-minute, I mean, obviously we can't compare that one with indoor, but his speed now is 37 k's an hour, you know, that's getting up there, so that's really good.
[01:01:15] Abby Jorgensen: Yeah, I mean, he has that new TT bike, which helps.
[01:01:19] Gerard Donnelly: Yes, that makes sense, yep.
[01:01:22] Gerard Donnelly: So, yeah, really good.
[01:01:31] Gerard Donnelly: So, that's great, you're getting him to do a long run, a long, progressive, fast run.
[01:01:34] Gerard Donnelly: So, and what week's that?
[01:01:39] Gerard Donnelly: A week.
[01:01:44] Gerard Donnelly: You tested this week, is that what you did?
[01:01:46] Gerard Donnelly: No, that was a test this week.
[01:01:49] Gerard Donnelly: Yeah, that was a this week.
[01:01:51] Gerard Donnelly: So one.
[01:01:54] Gerard Donnelly: How did he go in his 20-minute, 238, so he improved on his 20-minute as well.
[01:02:00] Gerard Donnelly: Mm-hmm.
[01:02:03] Gerard Donnelly: Got to be happy with that.
[01:02:04] Gerard Donnelly: So that's week one?
[01:02:05] Abby Jorgensen: Yeah, mean, he's really determined because he did a VO2 max on the treadmill and then he did a sweat test this weekend as well.
[01:02:15] Abby Jorgensen: So we're waiting on the sweat test results.
[01:02:17] Abby Jorgensen: So hopefully that makes him open up his eyes to what he needs to do for nutrition a little bit.
[01:02:24] Abby Jorgensen: Okay.
[01:02:26] Abby Jorgensen: Now that program's good, Abby.
[01:02:28] Gerard Donnelly: If you can, you know, just keep pushing this run out to an hour, right?
[01:02:36] Gerard Donnelly: Okay.
[01:02:37] Gerard Donnelly: And Thursday run the same.
[01:02:39] Gerard Donnelly: It's got to be closer to an hour, an hour 20, right?
[01:02:43] Gerard Donnelly: So just add to the warm-up and cool-down?
[01:02:46] Abby Jorgensen: Yeah, yeah.
[01:02:47] Gerard Donnelly: Just leave the session the way you've written it, but just add more time to the warm-up and cool-down.
[01:02:51] Gerard Donnelly: Yeah.
[01:02:53] Gerard Donnelly: Is he coping with those?
[01:02:55] Gerard Donnelly: No, he hasn't done it.
[01:02:58] Abby Jorgensen: He did.
[01:02:59] Abby Jorgensen: I think he did some couple.
[01:03:01] Abby Jorgensen: Yeah.
[01:03:07] Abby Jorgensen: He did buy a treadmill, so now we have that, when it gets too hot, they're in here.
[01:03:14] Gerard Donnelly: Yep, yep, good.
[01:03:15] Gerard Donnelly: Okay.
[01:03:17] Gerard Donnelly: Yep, good.
[01:03:18] Gerard Donnelly: Mark Kroll?
[01:03:21] Gerard Donnelly: Yeah, we'll test him again.
[01:03:22] Abby Jorgensen: He's in Utah right now, but testing Wednesday, I believe.
[01:03:28] Abby Jorgensen: So, he's done his first block of training with us?
[01:03:32] Gerard Donnelly: Yep.
[01:03:33] Gerard Donnelly: And how's the communication going with him?
[01:03:36] Gerard Donnelly: Really good, yeah.
[01:03:37] Abby Jorgensen: We, a few times a week, because a lot of times, depending on his work schedule, since he's a eye surgeon, things get a little all over the place, and the weather, so.
[01:03:51] Abby Jorgensen: Where's he living?
[01:03:56] Gerard Donnelly: Can you ask Floyd to put Mark Kroll in the spreadsheet?
[01:04:02] Gerard Donnelly: Please.
[01:04:04] Gerard Donnelly: And catch up his previous testing.
[01:04:32] Gerard Donnelly: Are with the grandkids?
[01:04:34] Gerard Donnelly: No, they're actually next door.
[01:04:37] Gerard Donnelly: Our two grandkids are at kindergarten, but these are the kids next door.
[01:04:46] Gerard Donnelly: I'm up in Sunshine Coast, in Queensland.
[01:04:51] Gerard Donnelly: Okay.
[01:04:54] Abby Jorgensen: With Liam.
[01:04:55] Gerard Donnelly: Liam and you know where Sunshine Coast 70.3 was two weeks ago?
[01:05:00] Gerard Donnelly: Weird.
[01:05:02] Gerard Donnelly: Did you have anybody in that race?
[01:05:06] Gerard Donnelly: Michaela.
[01:05:07] Abby Jorgensen: No, she was in West.
[01:05:09] Abby Jorgensen: No, I didn't have anybody in the...
[01:05:11] Abby Jorgensen: Sunshine Coast.
[01:05:16] Gerard Donnelly: So you're happy with the way Mark has been training?
[01:05:18] Abby Jorgensen: Yeah, he's been hitting his numbers and is running because he has a half marathon in a few weeks.
[01:05:23] Abby Jorgensen: So, or four weeks, three weeks, four weeks.
[01:05:25] Abby Jorgensen: So, yeah.
[01:05:27] Abby Jorgensen: Yeah, that's good.
[01:05:29] Gerard Donnelly: Yeah.
[01:05:31] Gerard Donnelly: How's he going with his other session?
[01:05:36] Abby Jorgensen: This week it...
[01:05:38] Abby Jorgensen: Where was it?
[01:05:39] Abby Jorgensen: It was on the previous...
[01:05:41] Abby Jorgensen: We moved it to the Sunday of the previous week.
[01:05:44] Abby Jorgensen: Yeah.
[01:05:48] Gerard Donnelly: Great.
[01:05:49] Gerard Donnelly: Fantastic.
[01:05:54] Gerard Donnelly: Okay.
[01:05:55] Gerard Donnelly: So, what did he do last test?
[01:05:59] Gerard Donnelly: you...
[01:05:59] Gerard Donnelly: you.
[01:06:00] Gerard Donnelly: Yeah.
[01:06:00] Gerard Donnelly: Okay.
[01:06:01] Gerard Donnelly: Bye.
[01:06:02] Gerard Donnelly: Bye.
[01:06:02] Gerard Donnelly: Oh, I can't remember off the top of my head.
[01:06:07] Gerard Donnelly: 179, so, yeah.
[01:06:12] Gerard Donnelly: And he started at 181, so, yeah, tell him to start, you know, a little bit more conservative, maybe 178, 177.
[01:06:22] Gerard Donnelly: Okay.
[01:06:23] Gerard Donnelly: And then go for it.
[01:06:30] Gerard Donnelly: Okay, so, good, Chattanooga, that's really helpful for me, now I know, and he's got November 2nd, this is what I need to see.
[01:06:36] Gerard Donnelly: I thought I had it and all, I go through it sometimes a little fast.
[01:06:42] Gerard Donnelly: So, testing week, great, okay.
[01:06:44] Gerard Donnelly: And then he's got church on Saturdays, doesn't he?
[01:06:47] Gerard Donnelly: Or, yeah, some sort of thing.
[01:06:52] Abby Jorgensen: I don't know if I can handle that, but, yeah.
[01:06:55] Gerard Donnelly: Okay, anything else on Mac?
[01:06:58] Gerard Donnelly: Nope.
[01:06:59] Abby Jorgensen: Phillip?
[01:07:01] Abby Jorgensen: He's...
[01:07:02] Abby Jorgensen: He's testing this week as well.
[01:07:05] Abby Jorgensen: Great.
[01:07:08] Gerard Donnelly: Happy with the way he's training?
[01:07:09] Abby Jorgensen: Yeah, he's happy with it all.
[01:07:14] Abby Jorgensen: He's going into their winter too, but he has some hunting trips coming up on the weekend, so we've been communicating on all that stuff.
[01:07:23] Abby Jorgensen: But yeah, he's been hitting his sessions.
[01:07:26] Abby Jorgensen: Yep.
[01:07:28] Gerard Donnelly: And make sure you keep, you know, you're giving 30, 15, 6 by 5, make sure that, you know, remember, Abby, we've got in the threshold section, we've got those eight threshold sessions over or under, and I've added three more, six, seven, and eight.
[01:07:50] Gerard Donnelly: Okay.
[01:07:51] Gerard Donnelly: Yeah, so there's some more there.
[01:07:54] Gerard Donnelly: And don't forget, we've got the mixture group.
[01:07:58] Gerard Donnelly: So just try to make sure that they're not getting the same stuff.
[01:08:01] Gerard Donnelly: And we've got the.
[01:08:02] Gerard Donnelly: You know, sorry, not that one.
[01:08:05] Gerard Donnelly: The VO2, this is probably the one I would be pushing most athletes to be doing.
[01:08:11] Gerard Donnelly: We've got a VO2 and threshold mixture.
[01:08:14] Gerard Donnelly: And also you've got, you you've given him strength efforts, but you've also got the, you know, obviously all the VO2s.
[01:08:22] Gerard Donnelly: You've got 30-15s, 30-30s, 40-20s, 60-30s, 60-60s.
[01:08:27] Gerard Donnelly: And then you've got the eight minute, you've got these.
[01:08:32] Gerard Donnelly: One, two, three, four in a row of those three by eight threshold efforts.
[01:08:40] Gerard Donnelly: Okay.
[01:08:41] Gerard Donnelly: Just keep reminding yourself that there's, you know, and then also we've got the five by, you know, we've got the five by five strength.
[01:08:48] Gerard Donnelly: And then we've got the five by five normal cadence, you know, up to six of those.
[01:08:54] Gerard Donnelly: So try to give them, you know, the eight minute threshold sessions instead of the five minute.
[01:09:01] Gerard Donnelly: You can give them 60.
[01:09:02] Gerard Donnelly: You
[01:09:02] Gerard Donnelly: Sixties, you can give them the over-unders, like I was showing you.
[01:09:08] Gerard Donnelly: There's eight of those.
[01:09:09] Gerard Donnelly: So just keep mixing for each block up so that the athlete doesn't feel like, oh, not these again.
[01:09:18] Gerard Donnelly: Okay?
[01:09:19] Gerard Donnelly: Yep.
[01:09:20] Abby Jorgensen: Yeah, I never know what to do next, I guess.
[01:09:23] Abby Jorgensen: Yeah.
[01:09:24] Abby Jorgensen: I mean, yeah.
[01:09:28] Abby Jorgensen: It's hard sometimes to know what they're capable of.
[01:09:32] Abby Jorgensen: I hear a message warning, suspicious calling.
[01:09:37] Gerard Donnelly: Nice scammer.
[01:09:40] Abby Jorgensen: Sorry.
[01:09:41] Abby Jorgensen: Just got a call.
[01:09:42] Gerard Donnelly: had a suspicious calling platform.
[01:09:46] Abby Jorgensen: You get those all the time.
[01:09:50] Gerard Donnelly: Okay, so let's just see how it goes with his testing.
[01:09:52] Abby Jorgensen: Yep.
[01:09:53] Abby Jorgensen: Erin?
[01:09:56] Abby Jorgensen: We did test her last week, or at least swim and FTP, just to get her back on.
[01:10:02] Abby Jorgensen: On track, but then she's doing like a 10-day road trip with her parents.
[01:10:09] Abby Jorgensen: So we're just going to try to – she's going be motivated to get back on track.
[01:10:14] Abby Jorgensen: It's just she's had some travel coming up here with family.
[01:10:19] Gerard Donnelly: So she tested last Thursday, is that right?
[01:10:23] Abby Jorgensen: Yep.
[01:10:23] Abby Jorgensen: She was happy with it considering.
[01:10:26] Abby Jorgensen: Yep.
[01:10:28] Gerard Donnelly: So you might have to make a note.
[01:10:30] Gerard Donnelly: Her data's not in the spreadsheet.
[01:10:36] Gerard Donnelly: So Marv.
[01:10:39] Gerard Donnelly: So she did 217.
[01:10:41] Gerard Donnelly: So in August she did 149.
[01:10:43] Gerard Donnelly: Is that – that's a 50-watt improvement.
[01:10:46] Gerard Donnelly: Is that – is that right?
[01:10:49] Abby Jorgensen: In May she did 260.
[01:10:51] Gerard Donnelly: So what's that one in August?
[01:10:53] Gerard Donnelly: How can you drop 100 watts from May to August?
[01:10:56] Gerard Donnelly: Is that right?
[01:10:58] Gerard Donnelly: I don't know if that was – I saw it the other day too and I was like, where is that?
[01:11:07] Gerard Donnelly: Right, so 14th of August, what's that?
[01:11:11] Abby Jorgensen: I don't remember if we tried to test her and then her hip wasn't cooperating.
[01:11:16] Abby Jorgensen: I'm to remember.
[01:11:18] Abby Jorgensen: So I'm scrolling back to the 14th of August.
[01:11:22] Gerard Donnelly: There's nothing there.
[01:11:24] Abby Jorgensen: Yeah, I don't know where.
[01:11:28] Gerard Donnelly: Right, I'm going to put...
[01:11:35] Gerard Donnelly: This is not true.
[01:11:39] Gerard Donnelly: Maybe you felt the wrong person and I don't know.
[01:11:43] Gerard Donnelly: So reach out to...
[01:11:46] Gerard Donnelly: So where was her last FTP?
[01:11:48] Abby Jorgensen: It's been a while because she's been hurt.
[01:11:50] Abby Jorgensen: So she's happy with the new starting point.
[01:11:54] Gerard Donnelly: So just message Marv that she did it last week and it's not been recorded.
[01:11:59] Gerard Donnelly: Okay.
[01:12:00] Gerard Donnelly: Did they record to swim?
[01:12:04] Abby Jorgensen: No.
[01:12:07] Gerard Donnelly: So why is that missed?
[01:12:10] Gerard Donnelly: Oh, because there's no result.
[01:12:12] Gerard Donnelly: There should be for her swim.
[01:12:15] Abby Jorgensen: Right, so there's nothing there.
[01:12:19] Gerard Donnelly: She said, having some issues with training picks this A&M completed as planned, 1310 for 119.
[01:12:25] Gerard Donnelly: God, is that true?
[01:12:27] Gerard Donnelly: Yeah, she's a good swimmer.
[01:12:33] Gerard Donnelly: Right, and in the spreadsheet, she's got in May 24 minutes.
[01:12:39] Gerard Donnelly: That's a wrong, that's not right.
[01:12:41] Abby Jorgensen: Yeah, he must have entered somebody else wrong because if you look at all of her other times.
[01:12:47] Abby Jorgensen: Yeah, we've got to get this sorted.
[01:12:48] Gerard Donnelly: So this is, okay, tell him when you're messaging Marv in the app.
[01:12:58] Gerard Donnelly: Mm-hmm.
[01:12:59] Abby Jorgensen: Yeah.
[01:12:59] Abby Jorgensen: Okay.
[01:12:59] Gerard Donnelly: Yeah, So...
[01:13:02] Gerard Donnelly: So...
[01:13:02] Gerard Donnelly: So...
[01:13:02] Gerard Donnelly: And her time is 13.10 at 1.19, can you put that in?
[01:13:07] Gerard Donnelly: And obviously Aaron hasn't been able to load it.
[01:13:11] Gerard Donnelly: So just make a note.
[01:13:13] Gerard Donnelly: That's not Marv's fault.
[01:13:14] Gerard Donnelly: He wouldn't have read the notes.
[01:13:16] Gerard Donnelly: He would just open up.
[01:13:18] Gerard Donnelly: He would just click on the analyse and he can't click on it and he wouldn't.
[01:13:21] Gerard Donnelly: He needs to obviously read the note.
[01:13:25] Gerard Donnelly: But he needs to record that for us.
[01:13:28] Gerard Donnelly: And he needs to record the FTP.
[01:13:31] Gerard Donnelly: Okay?
[01:13:32] Gerard Donnelly: Okay.
[01:13:34] Gerard Donnelly: If we open up these spreadsheets, we have to trust them, Abby.
[01:13:37] Gerard Donnelly: And if they're missing, that's not your fault.
[01:13:41] Gerard Donnelly: But it is your fault if you don't follow up to see if it's in the spreadsheet.
[01:13:46] Gerard Donnelly: It's not your fault that he hasn't recorded it.
[01:13:49] Gerard Donnelly: But I don't want to see a gap between the last time Aaron's done a swim.
[01:13:55] Gerard Donnelly: I'd say the 29th of May is incorrect.
[01:13:58] Gerard Donnelly: Does it mean she hasn't tested since May?
[01:14:00] Gerard Donnelly: It's now October.
[01:14:02] Gerard Donnelly: it.
[01:14:02] Gerard Donnelly: go.
[01:14:02] Gerard Donnelly: Yeah.
[01:14:03] Gerard Donnelly: Yeah.
[01:14:04] Abby Jorgensen: She's had this injury going on for quite some time.
[01:14:08] Abby Jorgensen: Yeah.
[01:14:08] Abby Jorgensen: Okay.
[01:14:09] Gerard Donnelly: And at least you know that that's the reason, you know, but I'd be saying that one's wrong as well.
[01:14:15] Abby Jorgensen: Yeah.
[01:14:15] Abby Jorgensen: I don't know where that's from.
[01:14:18] Abby Jorgensen: She could probably swim.
[01:14:21] Abby Jorgensen: Yeah.
[01:14:23] Abby Jorgensen: Yeah.
[01:14:24] Gerard Donnelly: Okay.
[01:14:27] Gerard Donnelly: She's traveling.
[01:14:30] Gerard Donnelly: Thank you.
[01:14:32] Gerard Donnelly: She's traveling.
[01:14:33] Gerard Donnelly: Okay.
[01:14:34] Gerard Donnelly: Um, what's, what's she training for?
[01:14:37] Abby Jorgensen: At the moment, just trying to get back to healthy and then she's going to pick a race.
[01:14:42] Abby Jorgensen: Yeah.
[01:14:42] Abby Jorgensen: Great.
[01:14:45] Abby Jorgensen: Fantastic.
[01:14:46] Gerard Donnelly: Uh, so, so because of the travel, she won't have a bike.
[01:14:52] Gerard Donnelly: Is that right?
[01:14:53] Gerard Donnelly: That's correct.
[01:14:53] Gerard Donnelly: Yeah.
[01:14:54] Abby Jorgensen: So she was like running whatever's in the gym.
[01:14:57] Abby Jorgensen: She doesn't know what the hotels have yet.
[01:14:59] Abby Jorgensen: So.
[01:14:59] Abby Jorgensen: And she's.
[01:15:01] Gerard Donnelly: She.
[01:15:02] Gerard Donnelly: She's going to Yellowstone, and do you think most of those hotels have gyms, do you think?
[01:15:13] Gerard Donnelly: Depends on where you stay.
[01:15:14] Abby Jorgensen: mean, if you're staying in kind of out in the middle, kind of those, like, it's kind of out in the middle of nowhere.
[01:15:22] Abby Jorgensen: It just depends on what type of hotels or Airbnbs they're staying at.
[01:15:27] Gerard Donnelly: I would be going into the RPE, and I'd be just grabbing, you know, a hotel gym bike, and I'd just be putting it there, saying, I don't know if they've got one, just put optional, okay?
[01:15:40] Abby Jorgensen: Okay.
[01:15:41] Gerard Donnelly: Just so that she can go, oh, there is a hotel gym bike.
[01:15:44] Gerard Donnelly: Yeah.
[01:15:44] Gerard Donnelly: And here we go.
[01:15:45] Abby Jorgensen: I've got a session.
[01:15:46] Abby Jorgensen: She was going to text me when she gets to the hotels and figure it all out, but, yeah.
[01:15:52] Abby Jorgensen: Yeah, so make sure you do.
[01:15:53] Gerard Donnelly: She can't have this, what is it, 12 days where she's, you know, we really want to, she's had.
[01:16:02] Gerard Donnelly: Well, all that time missing from injury, now we, you know what mean?
[01:16:07] Gerard Donnelly: Yeah.
[01:16:08] Gerard Donnelly: So I'd be given a set one, set two, and if she can't do it, that's great.
[01:16:13] Gerard Donnelly: But if it's not in there, she'd be going, oh, there's nothing in there.
[01:16:15] Gerard Donnelly: I'll just do some core and strength work.
[01:16:18] Gerard Donnelly: But we need her riding a bike, obviously.
[01:16:21] Gerard Donnelly: You okay with that?
[01:16:22] Gerard Donnelly: Yep.
[01:16:23] Gerard Donnelly: You can just, you know, throw in whatever you want over those weeks.
[01:16:26] Gerard Donnelly: But make sure that she's got some options.
[01:16:30] Gerard Donnelly: Okay?
[01:16:30] Abby Jorgensen: Yep.
[01:16:34] Gerard Donnelly: Uh, Riley.
[01:16:38] Abby Jorgensen: He just got done with the gravel race in Colorado.
[01:16:42] Abby Jorgensen: Oh, how'd he go?
[01:16:44] Abby Jorgensen: He said it, what'd he say?
[01:16:46] Abby Jorgensen: He's like, there's no way I could have done that, like, I don't know, before I started.
[01:16:51] Abby Jorgensen: He's like, I would have, I would have died.
[01:16:53] Abby Jorgensen: Um, I would have rode too hard.
[01:16:56] Abby Jorgensen: Yep.
[01:16:57] Abby Jorgensen: Um, things like that.
[01:16:59] Abby Jorgensen: So, so he did.
[01:17:01] Abby Jorgensen: He enjoyed.
[01:17:02] Abby Jorgensen: Wait a minute, he said he, I don't, I didn't understand, he rode, I think he rode a weight class up, and he said he was able.
[01:17:13] Gerard Donnelly: What a tough day, 1500 meters.
[01:17:21] Gerard Donnelly: He's pushing up.
[01:17:22] Gerard Donnelly: Up in the Colorado too, so altitude.
[01:17:25] Abby Jorgensen: Yep.
[01:17:27] Abby Jorgensen: But he said he fell.
[01:17:30] Gerard Donnelly: That's really good.
[01:17:32] Gerard Donnelly: What's he heading towards?
[01:17:35] Gerard Donnelly: It's fantastic, well done.
[01:17:41] Gerard Donnelly: Did he run a 10K last?
[01:17:44] Gerard Donnelly: Yes.
[01:17:45] Abby Jorgensen: It wasn't, he was not happy with his execution.
[01:17:50] Abby Jorgensen: But he'd never really run one before, so.
[01:17:54] Abby Jorgensen: That's great.
[01:17:55] Abby Jorgensen: So we're kind of happy with, I was like, we'll worry about execution the next one.
[01:18:00] Abby Jorgensen: And we just wanted to see.
[01:18:01] Abby Jorgensen: Yep.
[01:18:02] Abby Jorgensen: Just wanted
[01:18:02] Abby Jorgensen: See what you're capable of.
[01:18:04] Gerard Donnelly: Okay, so Abby, there's nothing in the spreadsheet for his 10K.
[01:18:11] Gerard Donnelly: So you need to keep checking all this, because I'll just presume he hasn't done one.
[01:18:16] Gerard Donnelly: If I'm saying, you know, whenever he does the next 10K, I go, oh, that's his first 10K, and you and I won't ever remember.
[01:18:23] Gerard Donnelly: There's no way we can remember that he'd done one before.
[01:18:29] Gerard Donnelly: So if you've got time sometime, just every two or three days, just grab two or three athletes and just scroll back and go into the spreadsheet and just check the last three months, whether the information, just keep working your way through that over four or five weeks with all your athletes to make sure that you're happy.
[01:18:51] Gerard Donnelly: And the minute you see something missing, don't you fill it in.
[01:18:55] Gerard Donnelly: You just send a message to Marv and say, I want you to catch up this date, this FTP on this date, this 10K on this date.
[01:19:02] Gerard Donnelly: Right.
[01:19:03] Gerard Donnelly: And it's, you know, don't think you're annoying him.
[01:19:06] Gerard Donnelly: He should have done this.
[01:19:08] Gerard Donnelly: So unless Floyd hasn't put it in the athlete's weekly plan.
[01:19:15] Gerard Donnelly: Okay.
[01:19:16] Gerard Donnelly: I don't know how that works.
[01:19:18] Gerard Donnelly: So Floyd goes through every single person's training picks that you've created for all your athletes.
[01:19:23] Gerard Donnelly: And she picks out that, you know, you're doing an Ironman on this date.
[01:19:27] Gerard Donnelly: And in the weekly, we've got the list of every single athlete we coach.
[01:19:32] Gerard Donnelly: And there's, you know, you know, Riley's doing 10K on Thursday the 25th.
[01:19:37] Gerard Donnelly: And then someone's doing their FTP.
[01:19:41] Gerard Donnelly: And that is recorded every week.
[01:19:44] Gerard Donnelly: And then Marv goes through and ticks them as he, as he records them, he ticks them.
[01:19:49] Gerard Donnelly: So if Floyd doesn't see that there's an event on, sometimes an athlete will put an event in or a coach will put an event in after Floyd has done it on the Monday morning, which can happen, but it's really rare.
[01:20:02] Gerard Donnelly: Someone's missing.
[01:20:03] Gerard Donnelly: Either Floyd is missing it or Marv's missing it.
[01:20:07] Gerard Donnelly: One of the two are missing it.
[01:20:08] Gerard Donnelly: Okay?
[01:20:09] Gerard Donnelly: Okay.
[01:20:13] Gerard Donnelly: And there's a time trial there on Monday.
[01:20:16] Gerard Donnelly: Did he record that?
[01:20:18] Gerard Donnelly: He did.
[01:20:19] Gerard Donnelly: Great.
[01:20:20] Gerard Donnelly: That's strange, isn't it?
[01:20:21] Gerard Donnelly: He's recorded the time trial.
[01:20:23] Abby Jorgensen: Like some of them, I feel like they get recorded and some don't.
[01:20:26] Abby Jorgensen: I don't know.
[01:20:27] Abby Jorgensen: So I want you to...
[01:20:28] Abby Jorgensen: Time issue of like they're checking the programming here in the U.S.
[01:20:33] Abby Jorgensen: different, like when they're checking it versus, I don't know.
[01:20:36] Gerard Donnelly: Yeah, that's true because he's in Indonesia.
[01:20:41] Gerard Donnelly: So he would check.
[01:20:42] Gerard Donnelly: He would check on Monday to see what's happened on Sunday or Saturday.
[01:20:48] Gerard Donnelly: But this is a Thursday.
[01:20:50] Gerard Donnelly: You know what I mean?
[01:20:51] Gerard Donnelly: He's got Friday, Saturday, Sunday to check that.
[01:20:56] Gerard Donnelly: Okay.
[01:20:58] Gerard Donnelly: So just getting to recover from that event.
[01:21:01] Gerard Donnelly: Okay.
[01:21:01] Gerard Donnelly: Okay.
[01:21:01] Gerard Donnelly: Okay.
[01:21:04] Gerard Donnelly: Tough, tough to get him to do that hard session after that six hour.
[01:21:07] Gerard Donnelly: Oh, I don't know if I'd done that, Abby.
[01:21:10] Gerard Donnelly: Okay.
[01:21:10] Gerard Donnelly: That's a bit cruel, but why don't we swap that out?
[01:21:16] Gerard Donnelly: Okay.
[01:21:17] Gerard Donnelly: Let's just put that over there.
[01:21:21] Gerard Donnelly: Just remember, after they've done a huge epic ride like that, you don't want to slam them with a threshold.
[01:21:29] Gerard Donnelly: I'll be giving him over under.
[01:21:31] Gerard Donnelly: Okay.
[01:21:32] Gerard Donnelly: And tell him why.
[01:21:34] Gerard Donnelly: Hey, we want to get back into your program, but, oh, you've already given him one on the, sorry, you've done exactly that.
[01:21:40] Gerard Donnelly: Sorry.
[01:21:45] Gerard Donnelly: Um, so maybe, maybe you can give him that three by five.
[01:21:49] Gerard Donnelly: It's not as hard.
[01:21:50] Gerard Donnelly: Okay.
[01:21:51] Gerard Donnelly: Okay.
[01:21:54] Gerard Donnelly: Um, do you think that means he's missed this session or has he just not got to it?
[01:22:00] Gerard Donnelly: Let me look.
[01:22:01] Abby Jorgensen: look.
[01:22:02] Abby Jorgensen: Let me
[01:22:05] Abby Jorgensen: Yeah, I don't remember putting that there, but let's move it across then, if you don't accidentally like it dropped in somewhere different than I wanted it.
[01:22:21] Abby Jorgensen: Yep.
[01:22:23] Gerard Donnelly: Okay, it should read right now.
[01:22:25] Gerard Donnelly: So there's only two like we were going to do.
[01:22:27] Gerard Donnelly: All right?
[01:22:28] Abby Jorgensen: Okay.
[01:22:29] Gerard Donnelly: And then run, and then run.
[01:22:32] Gerard Donnelly: Remember, don't give them three minute hill repeats, give them two minutes.
[01:22:36] Abby Jorgensen: Okay, even if we've done all the, we've done some twos?
[01:22:40] Abby Jorgensen: Yep.
[01:22:40] Abby Jorgensen: I wouldn't go to this breeze.
[01:22:42] Gerard Donnelly: Threes is too hard on their Achilles.
[01:22:44] Gerard Donnelly: Okay.
[01:22:45] Gerard Donnelly: They run too hard, Abby, and it's just a...
[01:22:48] Gerard Donnelly: So I would give him the tempo intervals next.
[01:22:52] Gerard Donnelly: Okay.
[01:22:52] Gerard Donnelly: Has he done a lot of hill efforts?
[01:22:56] Gerard Donnelly: Yeah, he's done them on a treadmill.
[01:22:58] Abby Jorgensen: Oh, there's no hills there, so...
[01:23:01] Abby Jorgensen: Yeah.
[01:23:01] Abby Jorgensen: is one.
[01:23:01] Abby Jorgensen: Okay.
[01:23:01] Abby Jorgensen: Okay.
[01:23:02] Abby Jorgensen: How give You
[01:23:09] Gerard Donnelly: You've got an ability.
[01:23:10] Gerard Donnelly: can keep going with five by two.
[01:23:12] Gerard Donnelly: Is that the last one he did, five by two?
[01:23:15] Gerard Donnelly: I'd give him six, seven, eight.
[01:23:17] Gerard Donnelly: Okay.
[01:23:20] Gerard Donnelly: Sorry, you've already given him six.
[01:23:24] Gerard Donnelly: So go six, seven, eight.
[01:23:26] Gerard Donnelly: That's okay.
[01:23:27] Gerard Donnelly: Okay.
[01:23:27] Gerard Donnelly: Let's change that one to six, seven, eight.
[01:23:30] Gerard Donnelly: All right?
[01:23:30] Gerard Donnelly: I'll delete that for you.
[01:23:32] Gerard Donnelly: Okay.
[01:23:51] Gerard Donnelly: All right.
[01:23:52] Gerard Donnelly: We'd better keep moving, eh?
[01:23:55] Abby Jorgensen: Okay.
[01:23:55] Abby Jorgensen: Yeah, past my bedtime.
[01:23:56] Abby Jorgensen: Okay, Dina?
[01:23:58] Abby Jorgensen: No.
[01:24:01] Abby Jorgensen: It's all right.
[01:24:02] Abby Jorgensen: Okay.
[01:24:05] Gerard Donnelly: Peter?
[01:24:07] Abby Jorgensen: He had a really good – he moved, so we're hopefully on track here.
[01:24:13] Abby Jorgensen: had a really good Sunday session, his first ride in North Carolina.
[01:24:19] Abby Jorgensen: So hopefully we can – He found a good spot.
[01:24:23] Gerard Donnelly: That's great.
[01:24:24] Gerard Donnelly: Look at that.
[01:24:25] Gerard Donnelly: Mm-hmm.
[01:24:26] Abby Jorgensen: Happy mountain.
[01:24:29] Gerard Donnelly: Yeah, he was happy with it.
[01:24:32] Abby Jorgensen: He's riding well.
[01:24:33] Gerard Donnelly: 41 Ks an hour at 248.
[01:24:40] Gerard Donnelly: 236.
[01:24:43] Gerard Donnelly: Oh, up a hill.
[01:24:46] Abby Jorgensen: Well, he needs – for Marbello, he needs – Yeah.
[01:24:50] Abby Jorgensen: There's some – yeah, there's some good hills out there where he's at, so.
[01:24:53] Abby Jorgensen: Good.
[01:24:58] Gerard Donnelly: Yeah, just make sure he's doing out and back.
[01:25:00] Gerard Donnelly: That's right.
[01:25:01] Gerard Donnelly: Good stuff.
[01:25:02] Gerard Donnelly: stuff.
[01:25:02] Gerard Donnelly: Good
[01:25:04] Gerard Donnelly: Yeah, happy with what he's doing?
[01:25:08] Abby Jorgensen: Yeah, he's been communicating great now that, you know, he was a bit stressed right before the move, so we just tried to get him through that and then back on track here.
[01:25:23] Gerard Donnelly: Yeah, I'm not sure about the 6x3, Abby.
[01:25:28] Gerard Donnelly: So you've got him doing a Zone 2, that's outside, is it?
[01:25:34] Abby Jorgensen: Yeah, he wants, yeah.
[01:25:40] Gerard Donnelly: The 6x3 is great, but we still want to have longer threshold efforts somewhere, okay?
[01:25:47] Abby Jorgensen: Okay.
[01:25:48] Gerard Donnelly: So I would be maybe giving him the VO2 threshold or the over-under, so either something out of there or something out of there.
[01:26:16] Gerard Donnelly: So what about his running?
[01:26:18] Gerard Donnelly: What's going on with his running?
[01:26:20] Gerard Donnelly: He's got a long run on Wednesday.
[01:26:22] Gerard Donnelly: Great.
[01:26:23] Abby Jorgensen: He's running on flight Tuesday.
[01:26:24] Gerard Donnelly: Great.
[01:26:25] Gerard Donnelly: He's got that run.
[01:26:27] Gerard Donnelly: Fantastic.
[01:26:29] Gerard Donnelly: And is there tempo marathon paced?
[01:26:37] Gerard Donnelly: Half marathon paced, okay.
[01:26:40] Gerard Donnelly: So this should be half marathon paced here on the 12K.
[01:26:45] Gerard Donnelly: So we wouldn't want to do that again.
[01:26:49] Gerard Donnelly: It's the same run.
[01:26:52] Abby Jorgensen: Okay.
[01:26:52] Gerard Donnelly: So I would be wanting to do...
[01:27:02] Gerard Donnelly: Has he got time to train wherever you want him to train?
[01:27:05] Gerard Donnelly: No, not usually.
[01:27:08] Abby Jorgensen: And he doesn't always recover great from like a double harder sessions.
[01:27:15] Abby Jorgensen: Yeah.
[01:27:16] Abby Jorgensen: So that's what I'm trying to – his running is fine.
[01:27:20] Abby Jorgensen: Like he recovers from runs.
[01:27:22] Abby Jorgensen: It's like a bike into a hard run.
[01:27:24] Abby Jorgensen: He doesn't always recover.
[01:27:29] Gerard Donnelly: I want you to think about using these sessions now.
[01:27:32] Gerard Donnelly: These Norwegian sessions that Jordan's created.
[01:27:38] Gerard Donnelly: Okay.
[01:27:39] Abby Jorgensen: See these?
[01:27:40] Abby Jorgensen: Run Norwegian Threshold, NW.
[01:27:43] Abby Jorgensen: So I want those or not?
[01:27:46] Gerard Donnelly: Yeah, if you don't, reach out to Floyd to say, can you load the Run NW Threshold session to me, please?
[01:27:56] Gerard Donnelly: see.
[01:27:59] Gerard Donnelly: Okay.
[01:28:00] Gerard Donnelly: Thank you.
[01:28:14] Gerard Donnelly: Abby, think I would rather have him do, like he's got his long run there, and the reason you're doing that is it suits him better, is it, during the week?
[01:28:24] Gerard Donnelly: Yeah.
[01:28:25] Gerard Donnelly: Not on the weekend?
[01:28:27] Abby Jorgensen: Yeah, because, yeah, he wanted, I can't remember exactly, but it didn't work.
[01:28:35] Gerard Donnelly: With his time?
[01:28:36] Abby Jorgensen: Yeah, and with the back-to-back, like a hard run and then a hard bike the next day, he was struggling with that.
[01:28:48] Abby Jorgensen: So then I went, easy run.
[01:28:51] Gerard Donnelly: Remember, the reason he was struggling the most of the time is because he had the wrong numbers.
[01:28:55] Gerard Donnelly: Okay, yeah.
[01:28:57] Gerard Donnelly: So, um.
[01:29:02] Gerard Donnelly: Yeah.
[01:29:10] Gerard Donnelly: Is there Saturday, Sunday an issue with family or work or anything?
[01:29:14] Gerard Donnelly: Is there any reason why we can't swap?
[01:29:16] Gerard Donnelly: Is there anything stopping us there?
[01:29:18] Gerard Donnelly: I don't think so anymore, no.
[01:29:21] Abby Jorgensen: Now that he doesn't have, yeah, he just has his daughter to deal with because that's why he moved to North Carolina.
[01:29:29] Gerard Donnelly: Yeah, okay.
[01:29:30] Gerard Donnelly: But yeah, he doesn't have a partner anymore, so.
[01:29:33] Abby Jorgensen: Yeah.
[01:29:38] Gerard Donnelly: I would try him on the Thursday with that session.
[01:29:43] Gerard Donnelly: Sorry to interfere here, but I.
[01:29:45] Gerard Donnelly: It's fine.
[01:29:46] Abby Jorgensen: This is how I learn, so.
[01:29:47] Gerard Donnelly: And so, so he's got, he's got his swim.
[01:29:54] Gerard Donnelly: Ideally, the long ride should be here on the Wednesday and the long run here.
[01:30:02] Gerard Donnelly: And another threshold-type ride here.
[01:30:07] Gerard Donnelly: Ideally, this is how it should look with the swim and endurance ride there, and not a run off the bike.
[01:30:17] Gerard Donnelly: I'll just hide that for the minute, right?
[01:30:19] Gerard Donnelly: We can change this back if we're...
[01:30:45] Gerard Donnelly: So his last run was after the weekend, 6K, and then he did Tempo, so there.
[01:30:54] Gerard Donnelly: That's good.
[01:30:57] Gerard Donnelly: So I would...
[01:31:02] Gerard Donnelly: Give him a long – is it something – can he not run long on the weekend?
[01:31:07] Abby Jorgensen: Is that – Something with Wednesday, he had more time.
[01:31:14] Gerard Donnelly: Yeah, well, that's how he should be doing the long ride, okay, if he's got more time.
[01:31:18] Abby Jorgensen: Okay.
[01:31:19] Gerard Donnelly: Okay, but if you – because that seems a lot of – that's two and a half hours on a Tuesday.
[01:31:25] Gerard Donnelly: I would – I would be getting him to do Tuesday, then a run on Tuesday where he's running maybe 60 minutes or 50 minutes.
[01:31:37] Gerard Donnelly: It doesn't have to be off the bike, Abby.
[01:31:40] Gerard Donnelly: This is where you need to communicate.
[01:31:43] Gerard Donnelly: He could run in the morning – sorry.
[01:31:45] Gerard Donnelly: He could run or ride in the morning and run and ride or ride in the afternoon.
[01:31:50] Gerard Donnelly: They can be separated, but you would – you'd be able to tell me whether he can do that or not?
[01:31:55] Gerard Donnelly: Is that – Yeah, I don't think he can do mornings.
[01:31:59] Abby Jorgensen: He's usually after – afternoon timeframes.
[01:32:02] Abby Jorgensen: Yeah, okay.
[01:32:07] Gerard Donnelly: And I would be getting him to do the Norwegian 5x6 on the Thursday or Friday, preferably on the Thursday.
[01:32:21] Gerard Donnelly: So he just swims on the Friday, so he has a day off running and riding.
[01:32:26] Gerard Donnelly: This is how I would set it up for him.
[01:32:28] Gerard Donnelly: And then that way, on the Sunday, he doesn't do the tempo pace runs, because he's already doing that here on the Saturday.
[01:32:39] Gerard Donnelly: He's already running a little bit slower, but it's almost supposed to be the same run.
[01:32:44] Gerard Donnelly: And then he does his long run on Sunday, if that was possible.
[01:32:48] Gerard Donnelly: Okay.
[01:32:51] Abby Jorgensen: But I would make that longer.
[01:32:52] Gerard Donnelly: I'd make that 90 minutes.
[01:32:57] Gerard Donnelly: That's a big change, I know, but...
[01:32:59] Gerard Donnelly: Thank you.
[01:33:02] Gerard Donnelly: So is there anything there that you think he can't do?
[01:33:06] Gerard Donnelly: So we're running him Tuesday, we're running him Thursday, Saturday, and Sunday.
[01:33:11] Gerard Donnelly: So he's got a day off in between each run.
[01:33:15] Abby Jorgensen: You know him better than I do.
[01:33:18] Gerard Donnelly: Yeah, I'll message him now that he's moved.
[01:33:20] Abby Jorgensen: Like, I'll see what his schedule.
[01:33:22] Abby Jorgensen: Yeah.
[01:33:23] Gerard Donnelly: And see this right here, that doesn't have to be two hours 30.
[01:33:27] Gerard Donnelly: You can just say anything between, you know, I would say goal, you know, 90 minutes to 2.30.
[01:33:44] Gerard Donnelly: Okay.
[01:33:44] Gerard Donnelly: Anything in there?
[01:33:47] Gerard Donnelly: So take the pressure off him for two and a half hours.
[01:33:50] Gerard Donnelly: Maybe if we put, I don't know, two hours there.
[01:33:59] Abby Jorgensen: Okay.
[01:34:00] Abby Jorgensen: Okay.
[01:34:03] Gerard Donnelly: But what we're trying to do is get him to run these intervals right at his 402, 412 pace, which conversion is, you know, really fast mile, minute mile pace, six.
[01:34:18] Gerard Donnelly: And this is just an easy run.
[01:34:21] Gerard Donnelly: It can be off the bike or it can be separated.
[01:34:24] Gerard Donnelly: But as you say, if he rides in the afternoon, then you will be running straight away.
[01:34:29] Gerard Donnelly: And then, you know, so he's got his two hard bike rides back again.
[01:34:33] Gerard Donnelly: And if you've measured him, you know, if he's tested, when's the last time he tested again?
[01:34:41] Gerard Donnelly: This is crucial that he's got the right number.
[01:34:43] Gerard Donnelly: He did the race, didn't he?
[01:34:45] Gerard Donnelly: Yeah.
[01:34:52] Gerard Donnelly: I'm looking at his spreadsheet, Abby.
[01:34:54] Gerard Donnelly: So he did 308 on August the 28th.
[01:34:58] Gerard Donnelly: Has he done any more since then?
[01:35:01] Gerard Donnelly: No, because of races.
[01:35:04] Abby Jorgensen: We had all those Olympic races that he was doing.
[01:35:08] Gerard Donnelly: So is that test that we did, that's indoor, all right?
[01:35:13] Gerard Donnelly: So that should be accurate.
[01:35:15] Gerard Donnelly: The only question I would have, was he in the TT bike, in the TT position, using the TT power meter?
[01:35:25] Gerard Donnelly: So his FTP should be 293?
[01:35:39] Gerard Donnelly: Yeah, great.
[01:35:40] Gerard Donnelly: That's close enough, 292.
[01:35:45] Gerard Donnelly: So he should be able to do these numbers, shouldn't he?
[01:35:49] Gerard Donnelly: Yeah.
[01:35:53] Gerard Donnelly: Just telling that, you know, you and I have spoken, we've just adjusted the program and, you know.
[01:36:03] Gerard Donnelly: These numbers should be achievable.
[01:36:09] Gerard Donnelly: You all right with that?
[01:36:11] Gerard Donnelly: Yep, I'll text him.
[01:36:18] Gerard Donnelly: He's got him out there, isn't he?
[01:36:20] Gerard Donnelly: Yeah.
[01:36:23] Gerard Donnelly: Yep.
[01:36:44] Gerard Donnelly: Okay.
[01:36:50] Abby Jorgensen: I'm still on Nancy.
[01:36:52] Abby Jorgensen: Yeah, go to Nancy.
[01:36:54] Gerard Donnelly: You happy with Kristen and Dan?
[01:36:57] Gerard Donnelly: Yeah, Kristen's all over the place.
[01:36:59] Abby Jorgensen: I keep trying to...
[01:36:59] Abby Jorgensen: She's not very good at communicating right now.
[01:37:03] Abby Jorgensen: Um, but I'm, yeah, I'm working on her.
[01:37:07] Abby Jorgensen: Uh, Dan's good.
[01:37:09] Abby Jorgensen: Yeah.
[01:37:09] Abby Jorgensen: He's, he's great.
[01:37:11] Abby Jorgensen: Uh, Nancy.
[01:37:13] Abby Jorgensen: Yeah.
[01:37:13] Abby Jorgensen: We're just going into Kona here.
[01:37:15] Abby Jorgensen: Yep.
[01:37:16] Abby Jorgensen: Uh, but I mean, I just want to make sure everything looks good.
[01:37:22] Abby Jorgensen: I mean, other than that, she's been, you know, hitting her sessions, obviously.
[01:37:27] Abby Jorgensen: So that's great.
[01:37:30] Gerard Donnelly: Abby, you know, there's a swim there on Sunday.
[01:37:33] Gerard Donnelly: There is an organized swim she could do if she wanted.
[01:37:36] Gerard Donnelly: Okay.
[01:37:37] Abby Jorgensen: I'll tell her.
[01:37:38] Abby Jorgensen: She probably knows.
[01:37:39] Abby Jorgensen: But yeah, maybe that's why she was like, can you add an open water swim to Sunday?
[01:37:43] Abby Jorgensen: So that maybe that's why.
[01:37:44] Abby Jorgensen: Yep.
[01:37:46] Gerard Donnelly: Fiona that we coach is going.
[01:37:48] Gerard Donnelly: So you can tell Nancy that we, Fiona's going, but, um, uh, and I've got Fiona doing that swim on the Sunday morning.
[01:38:01] Abby Jorgensen: Okay.
[01:38:02] Abby Jorgensen: Okay.
[01:38:02] Abby Jorgensen: Okay.
[01:38:03] Gerard Donnelly: She's, Nancy's been to Kona that many times.
[01:38:06] Abby Jorgensen: Yeah, she should know.
[01:38:08] Abby Jorgensen: She knows everything.
[01:38:10] Abby Jorgensen: Yeah.
[01:38:14] Gerard Donnelly: So are you doing a little bit of a taper week?
[01:38:16] Gerard Donnelly: Yeah.
[01:38:17] Abby Jorgensen: Yeah.
[01:38:23] Gerard Donnelly: Yeah, okay.
[01:38:24] Gerard Donnelly: Just when does she arrive?
[01:38:27] Gerard Donnelly: Do you know when she arrives in Kona?
[01:38:30] Gerard Donnelly: Is it morning or night?
[01:38:31] Gerard Donnelly: She just needs to make sure that she gets her bike checked, that everything's working.
[01:38:39] Abby Jorgensen: I don't know.
[01:38:40] Abby Jorgensen: She leaves Cali.
[01:38:42] Abby Jorgensen: I know it's like a long flight.
[01:38:44] Abby Jorgensen: I know it's like a full day.
[01:38:46] Abby Jorgensen: Yeah.
[01:38:47] Gerard Donnelly: Okay.
[01:38:47] Gerard Donnelly: Yeah.
[01:38:48] Abby Jorgensen: She usually, she wanted, she said everything looks like it's doable, like.
[01:38:53] Abby Jorgensen: Yeah.
[01:38:54] Abby Jorgensen: Great.
[01:38:55] Abby Jorgensen: Digital standpoint.
[01:38:56] Abby Jorgensen: Yep.
[01:39:00] Gerard Donnelly: Probably, probably wouldn't, I'd probably swap that around.
[01:39:03] Gerard Donnelly: Okay.
[01:39:03] Gerard Donnelly: Yeah.
[01:39:03] Gerard Donnelly: Thank
[01:39:04] Gerard Donnelly: Because he's already swimming on Sunday.
[01:39:06] Gerard Donnelly: wouldn't do back-to-back swims.
[01:39:07] Gerard Donnelly: Okay.
[01:39:08] Gerard Donnelly: I'd get it back out on the bike on Monday.
[01:39:18] Gerard Donnelly: Okay.
[01:39:20] Gerard Donnelly: The rest of it's fine.
[01:39:24] Gerard Donnelly: Is Bill okay?
[01:39:26] Gerard Donnelly: Yep.
[01:39:26] Abby Jorgensen: I finished Ironman Chattanooga Sunday or yesterday.
[01:39:31] Abby Jorgensen: Yeah.
[01:39:32] Abby Jorgensen: Yeah, he says.
[01:39:33] Abby Jorgensen: I mean, he's tired.
[01:39:35] Abby Jorgensen: Yep.
[01:39:37] Abby Jorgensen: They're probably just getting home or driving when I talk to him.
[01:39:42] Abby Jorgensen: Yep.
[01:39:43] Abby Jorgensen: How did you go?
[01:39:46] Abby Jorgensen: I mean, the swim went good.
[01:39:49] Abby Jorgensen: The bike, he said it was hilly.
[01:39:53] Abby Jorgensen: But that went as good.
[01:39:54] Abby Jorgensen: And in the run, he survived.
[01:39:56] Abby Jorgensen: And he says his foot doesn't hurt.
[01:40:00] Abby Jorgensen: And he did start to cramp a little bit.
[01:40:02] Abby Jorgensen: Good.
[01:40:03] Abby Jorgensen: Good.
[01:40:03] Abby Jorgensen: Good.
[01:40:03] Abby Jorgensen: Thank
[01:40:04] Abby Jorgensen: Because he's already swimming on Sunday.
[01:40:06] Abby Jorgensen: wouldn't do back-to-back swims.
[01:40:07] Abby Jorgensen: Okay.
[01:40:08] Abby Jorgensen: I'd get it back out on the bike on Monday.
[01:40:18] Abby Jorgensen: Okay.
[01:40:20] Abby Jorgensen: The rest of it's fine.
[01:40:24] Abby Jorgensen: Is Bill okay?
[01:40:26] Abby Jorgensen: Yep.
[01:40:26] Abby Jorgensen: I finished Ironman Chattanooga Sunday or yesterday.
[01:40:31] Gerard Donnelly: Yeah.
[01:40:32] Abby Jorgensen: Yeah, he says.
[01:40:33] Abby Jorgensen: I mean, he's tired.
[01:40:35] Abby Jorgensen: Yep.
[01:40:37] Abby Jorgensen: They're probably just getting home or driving when I talk to him.
[01:40:42] Abby Jorgensen: Yep.
[01:40:43] Abby Jorgensen: How did you go?
[01:40:46] Abby Jorgensen: I mean, the swim went good.
[01:40:49] Abby Jorgensen: The bike, he said it was hilly.
[01:40:53] Gerard Donnelly: But that went as good.
[01:40:55] Abby Jorgensen: And in the run, he survived.
[01:40:56] Abby Jorgensen: And he says his foot doesn't hurt.
[01:41:00] Abby Jorgensen: And he did start to cramp a little bit.
[01:41:02] Gerard Donnelly: Good.
[01:41:03] Gerard Donnelly: Good.
[01:41:03] Gerard Donnelly: Good.
[01:41:03] Gerard Donnelly: Thank
[01:41:04] Gerard Donnelly: He said so.
[01:41:05] Gerard Donnelly: He tried to walk the hills and do all that, but he's happy with it because he was like, he PR'd even with a bad, like not going in with a whole lot of running.
[01:41:18] Gerard Donnelly: So he was happy with that.
[01:41:20] Gerard Donnelly: Wow.
[01:41:20] Gerard Donnelly: How much did he improve by?
[01:41:23] Gerard Donnelly: What did he say?
[01:41:28] Gerard Donnelly: When did you do that?
[01:41:29] Gerard Donnelly: Did you do that same race?
[01:41:31] Abby Jorgensen: he?
[01:41:31] Abby Jorgensen: No, he did another one.
[01:41:33] Abby Jorgensen: can't remember the location.
[01:41:34] Abby Jorgensen: California, maybe?
[01:41:35] Abby Jorgensen: No.
[01:41:36] Abby Jorgensen: Yeah, California.
[01:41:37] Abby Jorgensen: Hold on.
[01:41:46] Abby Jorgensen: He just said he ended up being faster than I was at California, and this was a way more challenging course.
[01:41:52] Abby Jorgensen: That's great news.
[01:41:53] Abby Jorgensen: But I'll talk to him on the phone on Thursday and get like a full, full rundown.
[01:42:01] Gerard Donnelly: Thank you.
[01:42:01] Gerard Donnelly: Beyond we'll see you next week.
[01:42:03] Gerard Donnelly: Thank you.
[01:42:03] Gerard Donnelly: Thank
[01:42:05] Gerard Donnelly: Am I doing something wrong?
[01:42:06] Gerard Donnelly: can't find his name in the array.
[01:42:10] Gerard Donnelly: It's Bill, not William.
[01:42:12] Gerard Donnelly: He goes by Bill.
[01:42:13] Gerard Donnelly: Yep, okay.
[01:42:19] Gerard Donnelly: How was if I put Bill, not Bull?
[01:42:27] Gerard Donnelly: 12.32, great.
[01:42:31] Gerard Donnelly: Yeah, said the swim ended up being non-wetsuit, and that never happens in Chattanooga, if that explains how warm it's been here.
[01:42:38] Gerard Donnelly: Yeah, okay.
[01:42:39] Abby Jorgensen: More than normal.
[01:42:41] Gerard Donnelly: He said, yeah, it was hotter.
[01:42:43] Gerard Donnelly: Was he happy with his bike?
[01:42:45] Gerard Donnelly: Yeah, I mean, he said, again, like it was hillier and windier than he thought it would be, because there was nothing blocking the wind.
[01:42:55] Abby Jorgensen: Yep.
[01:42:57] Abby Jorgensen: He did okay.
[01:42:58] Gerard Donnelly: mean, he was 25%, 62%.
[01:43:03] Gerard Donnelly: So, not too bad.
[01:43:17] Abby Jorgensen: Yeah, it's fair few climbs, isn't it?
[01:43:20] Abby Jorgensen: Mm-hmm.
[01:43:23] Abby Jorgensen: That's great.
[01:43:27] Abby Jorgensen: So, just send a screenshot of his, you know, the Ironman results page thing.
[01:43:38] Abby Jorgensen: Just send that to the coach's note, just saying, well done to Bill.
[01:43:49] Abby Jorgensen: What PB time did you say?
[01:43:51] Abby Jorgensen: You told me I already forgotten.
[01:43:53] Abby Jorgensen: He didn't give me a time.
[01:43:55] Abby Jorgensen: He just said it was a better time and a more challenging course.
[01:43:59] Abby Jorgensen: Yeah, just put that down.
[01:44:00] Abby Jorgensen: Big PB on a more challenging course.
[01:44:02] Abby Jorgensen: Mm-hmm.
[01:44:07] Abby Jorgensen: Okay.
[01:44:08] Abby Jorgensen: Yep.
[01:44:10] Gerard Donnelly: All right.
[01:44:11] Gerard Donnelly: We'll try again sometime next week.
[01:44:13] Abby Jorgensen: Yeah, should work.
[01:44:14] Abby Jorgensen: As of now, Monday, like I'm going to have a pretty consistent schedule like right now.
[01:44:20] Abby Jorgensen: So, yeah.
[01:44:21] Abby Jorgensen: And funny story.
[01:44:23] Abby Jorgensen: So my best friend who used to, way back when I first started, she owned the gym.
[01:44:29] Abby Jorgensen: Yes.
[01:44:31] Abby Jorgensen: And now she and another lady that they used to own the gym together are reopening another gym inside her old space.
[01:44:43] Abby Jorgensen: So I'm going to coach for them part-time to start with because they just don't have the capacity to pay me what I need.
[01:44:54] Gerard Donnelly: But hopefully, eventually, I'll be back to full-time gym.
[01:44:58] Gerard Donnelly: So, yeah, so I'm doing all their programs.
[01:45:03] Abby Jorgensen: Programming and stuff from there.
[01:45:06] Abby Jorgensen: But, yeah, it's kind of a – Just to run that past me again, did she own the building, did you say?
[01:45:13] Abby Jorgensen: Way back when I first moved here, she was like part owner of the gym.
[01:45:21] Abby Jorgensen: She sold out because she does hair.
[01:45:23] Abby Jorgensen: She does my hair.
[01:45:25] Abby Jorgensen: But nobody likes the decision that happened, obviously.
[01:45:30] Abby Jorgensen: And so they were just like, you know what, we're going to do this the right way and we're going to do it again better.
[01:45:37] Abby Jorgensen: Did you get all the equipment go, Abby?
[01:45:39] Gerard Donnelly: They sold most of it, so we're going to buy some – I mean, they're going to buy some more.
[01:45:46] Gerard Donnelly: We don't need as much because we're going to have a smaller space, but we're changing the model a little bit of how the program will look.
[01:45:55] Gerard Donnelly: Will that be better for you, having that job compared to the job you've now just started?
[01:46:01] Gerard Donnelly: Yeah, in the long run it will be.
[01:46:02] Gerard Donnelly: I mean, that's where
[01:46:03] Gerard Donnelly: Right.
[01:46:04] Gerard Donnelly: Like, that's where I thrive.
[01:46:05] Gerard Donnelly: Like, I thought a break from the gym would be good, but I've realized, you know, having a month off from the gym and in a different job, it's probably not like I miss the gym setting.
[01:46:16] Abby Jorgensen: So hopefully eventually I'll get back to that.
[01:46:19] Abby Jorgensen: But yeah, there she's like, you're not quitting your job yet because I can't pay you.
[01:46:24] Gerard Donnelly: I can't pay you that much.
[01:46:26] Gerard Donnelly: But but yeah, but I was like, you know, with this one to, you know, combination of things we can get to the the point where I have to work at the daycare.
[01:46:36] Gerard Donnelly: So that's great.
[01:46:38] Gerard Donnelly: I actually signed another person up for you yesterday.
[01:46:42] Gerard Donnelly: Yeah, saw that I watched the video.
[01:46:45] Gerard Donnelly: So James.
[01:46:46] Gerard Donnelly: So so that's, that's good.
[01:46:49] Gerard Donnelly: Get another get another athlete.
[01:46:53] Gerard Donnelly: Yeah, he'll be he'll be a good one.
[01:46:55] Abby Jorgensen: Yeah.
[01:46:56] Gerard Donnelly: He lives on Malta, which is, you know, you should Google it.
[01:47:01] Gerard Donnelly: It's like 25 kilometers from one into of
[01:47:03] Gerard Donnelly: The island to the other.
[01:47:05] Gerard Donnelly: So he's going to train a lot indoors.
[01:47:08] Gerard Donnelly: So hopefully you've got a gist of who he is.
[01:47:10] Gerard Donnelly: He's a very particular sort of person, I think.
[01:47:14] Gerard Donnelly: But yeah, you've seen the video.
[01:47:17] Gerard Donnelly: Malta.
[01:47:17] Gerard Donnelly: Is it just a small island?
[01:47:20] Gerard Donnelly: Yeah, right next.
[01:47:21] Gerard Donnelly: I was actually in Sicily during July this year, and Malta is right next to Sicily, next to Italy.
[01:47:29] Gerard Donnelly: Okay.
[01:47:30] Abby Jorgensen: It's right below Sicily.
[01:47:32] Gerard Donnelly: So he was quite impressed that I was in Sicily, right next door.
[01:47:37] Gerard Donnelly: But it's really hard to train in Malta because it's just not very big.
[01:47:41] Gerard Donnelly: It's like the size of Des Moines city.
[01:47:48] Abby Jorgensen: It's that, yeah.
[01:47:49] Abby Jorgensen: From one side of the city to the other, it's like 15 miles.
[01:47:53] Abby Jorgensen: Yeah, that would be.
[01:47:55] Abby Jorgensen: Yeah, give or take.
[01:47:56] Abby Jorgensen: Yeah.
[01:48:04] Abby Jorgensen: It trip, he said, but yeah, he's going to train indoors most of the time, so yeah, he'll be good.
