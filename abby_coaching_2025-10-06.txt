## Transcript

[00:00:00] Gerard Donnelly: Giving you that when you told me you're going to swim with him and he's training for whether you could.
[00:00:06] Gerard Donnelly: I'm happy for you to do as much as you want.
[00:00:08] Abby Jorgensen: It's fine.
[00:00:09] Abby Jorgensen: He had the, what was it, 16 by the 25-25s, and I did like 12 of them.
[00:00:14] Abby Jorgensen: Yes.
[00:00:16] Abby Jorgensen: I let him do a few lectures.
[00:00:17] Abby Jorgensen: I was like, yeah, I think I'm good.
[00:00:21] Abby Jorgensen: What's it feeling like swimming?
[00:00:22] Gerard Donnelly: Are you feeling like it's still hard work?
[00:00:25] Abby Jorgensen: No, it feels like super chill and easy.
[00:00:29] Abby Jorgensen: Like my heart rate never gets above like, I don't know, one, I don't know what it got to today.
[00:00:37] Abby Jorgensen: It never feels like it's high.
[00:00:39] Abby Jorgensen: I just replace, it's been raining here all day.
[00:00:42] Abby Jorgensen: Yeah, that's a tough day doing that.
[00:00:47] Abby Jorgensen: It's better than just doing two hours in Swift, so I needed something to keep me.
[00:00:52] Abby Jorgensen: No, it's perfect.
[00:00:54] Abby Jorgensen: Yeah.
[00:00:54] Abby Jorgensen: Yeah.
[00:00:56] Gerard Donnelly: Yeah, you've got to find an event at Beyond Zwift.
[00:00:59] Gerard Donnelly: at Zwift.
[00:00:59] Gerard Donnelly: You've You've Zwift.
[00:00:59] Gerard Donnelly: Thank
[00:01:00] Gerard Donnelly: And you can't just ride.
[00:01:02] Gerard Donnelly: You've got to find some long endurance event, which is not easy to do.
[00:01:09] Abby Jorgensen: Yeah.
[00:01:12] Gerard Donnelly: But, yeah, so that's good.
[00:01:15] Gerard Donnelly: You got the effort out.
[00:01:16] Gerard Donnelly: That's great.
[00:01:18] Gerard Donnelly: How's your running feeling?
[00:01:20] Abby Jorgensen: Yeah, yesterday's run felt good.
[00:01:25] Abby Jorgensen: It pushed the pace a little bit, but I wanted to kind of feel it out.
[00:01:30] Abby Jorgensen: Yep.
[00:01:31] Gerard Donnelly: And the Norwegian singles feeling okay?
[00:01:34] Abby Jorgensen: Yeah, I love those.
[00:01:36] Abby Jorgensen: Yeah.
[00:01:38] Gerard Donnelly: And how's the weather?
[00:01:39] Gerard Donnelly: it still?
[00:01:42] Abby Jorgensen: It was hot.
[00:01:44] Abby Jorgensen: Today it's cold and rainy again.
[00:01:48] Abby Jorgensen: Yeah.
[00:01:49] Abby Jorgensen: So, yeah, we're going through phases where it'll be cold for a while, and then it might pop up and be warm for a couple days and then down, so.
[00:01:58] Abby Jorgensen: Okay.
[00:01:59] Abby Jorgensen: Okay.
[00:02:01] Gerard Donnelly: So, kind of end of the block coming up for you, so it'd be good to do something easy next week, so you give yourself a real chance to have a go at that half marathon.
[00:02:16] Gerard Donnelly: Yeah, I kind of want to see what I can do.
[00:02:19] Abby Jorgensen: Yeah.
[00:02:21] Abby Jorgensen: It's fairly flat.
[00:02:24] Abby Jorgensen: There's, like, one bigger hill, but it's really not much of anything.
[00:02:30] Abby Jorgensen: Yeah, it's all about pacing.
[00:02:32] Gerard Donnelly: Yeah.
[00:02:34] Gerard Donnelly: That's the key.
[00:02:38] Gerard Donnelly: Okay, we'll move on to anything you want to talk about with your own training?
[00:02:43] Gerard Donnelly: No, no, everything.
[00:02:45] Abby Jorgensen: So, mean, like I said, starting next week, we should be able to kind of go back to a normal schedule.
[00:02:53] Gerard Donnelly: Yeah, you just let me know, and I'll just move stuff around to suit, so.
[00:03:00] Gerard Donnelly: Yeah.
[00:03:00] Abby Jorgensen: I mean, next week will be kind of a, like you said, a testing deload week.
[00:03:04] Abby Jorgensen: Yeah.
[00:03:07] Gerard Donnelly: We'll give you a swim time trial.
[00:03:08] Gerard Donnelly: We'll you a 20 minute FTP just to see where it's at and to get practice at executing.
[00:03:15] Gerard Donnelly: And then your half marathon will be your running test.
[00:03:23] Gerard Donnelly: So, yeah, with all of that stuff, it's really just, you know, the execution part is the key, you know, how you go about it.
[00:03:32] Gerard Donnelly: doesn't matter whether you're doing a 1K swim or a 20 minute FTP or a half marathon.
[00:03:37] Gerard Donnelly: If you get the execution wrong, it ends up being a really  experience.
[00:03:42] Gerard Donnelly: You just got to, that's the art of being, getting a good outcome is really getting that plan ready.
[00:03:51] Gerard Donnelly: And we should talk about that next week, what you're capable of doing.
[00:03:55] Abby Jorgensen: Yeah.
[00:03:57] Gerard Donnelly: And, you know, once you've got on.
[00:04:00] Gerard Donnelly: Top of the event, then try to bring it home with freedom to run as fast as you want.
[00:04:06] Gerard Donnelly: So we've got the Melbourne Marathon coming up this weekend, and there's, I think there's probably 12 people doing variations of 10k half marathon and marathon.
[00:04:21] Gerard Donnelly: And it's really interesting hearing some people's plan that's just so far away from their actual ability.
[00:04:29] Gerard Donnelly: Yeah.
[00:04:32] Gerard Donnelly: I don't know why people think they can run differently in a race than they can in training.
[00:04:38] Abby Jorgensen: They have no adrenaline, maybe, but still, then it just drains your carb load faster, and I don't know, it does a whole bunch of other things.
[00:04:47] Abby Jorgensen: Yeah.
[00:04:49] Gerard Donnelly: Okay, let's get stuck into it.
[00:04:53] Gerard Donnelly: Anybody in particular who you've got concerns at, straight up?
[00:04:57] Gerard Donnelly: Not concerns.
[00:04:58] Abby Jorgensen: I just, I want to...
[00:05:00] Abby Jorgensen: Go over Nancy's race plan and make sure, like, I'm on the right track before I present it to her.
[00:05:08] Abby Jorgensen: Has she presented you hers?
[00:05:10] Abby Jorgensen: She gave me her preliminary ones via text, and then she was going to send me, like, a whole email.
[00:05:18] Abby Jorgensen: She usually sends me a whole detailed report.
[00:05:21] Abby Jorgensen: So she was doing that today, she said.
[00:05:24] Abby Jorgensen: Well, great.
[00:05:24] Gerard Donnelly: Well, don't you show her what you're doing until you've seen what she's doing.
[00:05:28] Abby Jorgensen: Yeah, we're going to have a call, I think, Thursday.
[00:05:31] Abby Jorgensen: Yep.
[00:05:32] Abby Jorgensen: Great.
[00:05:32] Gerard Donnelly: Try to get that call earlier if you can.
[00:05:34] Gerard Donnelly: I don't know if that's the only day it suits her, but.
[00:05:37] Gerard Donnelly: Yeah, I was just trying.
[00:05:38] Abby Jorgensen: Well, yeah, with my work on Tuesday, Wednesday, I don't get off until 6.
[00:05:43] Abby Jorgensen: Yeah, okay.
[00:05:44] Abby Jorgensen: Well, that's fine.
[00:05:45] Gerard Donnelly: Stick with what you're doing.
[00:05:46] Gerard Donnelly: Just for future reference, I really think we need to change our mindset, me included, getting to talk to the athletes earlier in the week.
[00:05:55] Gerard Donnelly: I just feel there's a few athletes who have huge anxiety buildup.
[00:05:59] Gerard Donnelly: Yeah.
[00:05:59] Gerard Donnelly: Yeah.
[00:06:00] Gerard Donnelly: Yeah.
[00:06:00] Gerard Donnelly: And because they're unsure about whether their strategy and planning is correct, and they don't get to talk to us till Thursday or Friday or even sometimes Saturday, and we could really nullify a lot of that anxiety if we just talk to them Monday or Tuesday.
[00:06:16] Abby Jorgensen: I'm just thinking overall, don't worry about Nancy for this week, but I think her biggest thing is she was like telling me, she's like, there's 32 athletes in her age group, and she's, I don't know, I think she has all these expectations that she should, I don't know, be in the top, whatever, but like I'm trying to get her to realize it's just her versus her, and she should not worry about all the other athletes.
[00:06:44] Gerard Donnelly: Yeah, that sentence that you've said, she said to you, I would be just saying, Nancy, you're concentrating on the wrong thing.
[00:06:54] Gerard Donnelly: Yeah.
[00:06:55] Gerard Donnelly: You need to concentrate on the things that allow you to have the best race that you
[00:07:00] Gerard Donnelly: You can have.
[00:07:01] Gerard Donnelly: You just don't care about any other athlete.
[00:07:04] Gerard Donnelly: Your whole focus should be on how to execute your day.
[00:07:09] Gerard Donnelly: And if you do that really well, you'll have the result you want.
[00:07:14] Gerard Donnelly: And then you can check how that goes against the others.
[00:07:18] Abby Jorgensen: I mean, that's pretty much what I told her.
[00:07:20] Abby Jorgensen: I was like, if you execute, then that's all you need to worry about.
[00:07:23] Gerard Donnelly: And yeah, stop wasting energy on what others are doing and who else is in the race.
[00:07:32] Gerard Donnelly: And if, you know, the example I give, Tom and Roland, you know, they're really trying to win, you know.
[00:07:40] Gerard Donnelly: And so there is pressure on them.
[00:07:42] Gerard Donnelly: And I say to them the same thing.
[00:07:44] Gerard Donnelly: I said, Tom, if you go into this race, you know, solely focusing on I have to win, you're going to forget about all the things that are going to allow you to win.
[00:07:57] Gerard Donnelly: So you've got to do the things that allow you to get the result.
[00:08:00] Gerard Donnelly: The result is you win, then you've done it well.
[00:08:03] Gerard Donnelly: But imagine the pressure every time you go to a race where you're expected to win.
[00:08:11] Gerard Donnelly: And if you keep thinking like that, you'll go to an asylum.
[00:08:16] Gerard Donnelly: You need to just concentrate, no matter who you are, whether you're a beginner, an intermediate or an elite, you just need to concentrate on your own strategies and execution.
[00:08:27] Gerard Donnelly: And if you do that well, you've got to be happy with the result.
[00:08:32] Gerard Donnelly: If you stuff up your execution, sure, you can be unhappy, but that's on you.
[00:08:36] Gerard Donnelly: You know, you've got all these guidelines from us to help you get the right strategy.
[00:08:43] Gerard Donnelly: So you've got to really drum that out of her and just say you're thinking about the, you know, you're going to think about the wrong things here.
[00:08:53] Gerard Donnelly: Remember I said to you before your Ironman, how am I going to get that swim time?
[00:08:57] Gerard Donnelly: How am I going to get that ride?
[00:08:58] Gerard Donnelly: How am I going to get that run?
[00:08:59] Gerard Donnelly: If I
[00:09:00] Gerard Donnelly: What things am I going to concentrate on?
[00:09:02] Gerard Donnelly: You're on the ride, you're checking your power, on the run, you're checking your pace.
[00:09:05] Gerard Donnelly: That's all you're doing.
[00:09:06] Gerard Donnelly: You're in the moment, being in the moment the whole day.
[00:09:09] Gerard Donnelly: And the end result will be what it is, according to how well you execute.
[00:09:15] Gerard Donnelly: So that is the key conversation.
[00:09:18] Gerard Donnelly: And checking the data, you can get too carried away with that.
[00:09:23] Gerard Donnelly: You just have the ranges.
[00:09:25] Gerard Donnelly: And your job is to stay in there, Nancy.
[00:09:29] Gerard Donnelly: And, you know, Kona is one of those places where it's just so much harder than any other race they do.
[00:09:37] Gerard Donnelly: And the other girl, Fiona Myers, who's doing it, who I'm coaching, she thrashed on Harvey yesterday, going down the hill in a practice session.
[00:09:50] Gerard Donnelly: Harvey is the turnaround at Kona.
[00:09:53] Gerard Donnelly: So that's a long climb up to Harvey.
[00:09:56] Gerard Donnelly: That's a halfway point.
[00:09:57] Gerard Donnelly: And then she's coming down.
[00:09:59] Gerard Donnelly: And
[00:10:00] Gerard Donnelly: And she got a puncture and blew out her front tyre, skidded on the road and just ripped up her whole shoulder and her hip and her knee and her ankle and her shoes and broke the forks of her bike.
[00:10:14] Gerard Donnelly: So they can't get a replacement set of forks in time for the race on Saturday.
[00:10:21] Gerard Donnelly: So she's had to rent a bike.
[00:10:25] Gerard Donnelly: So, and this lady is an absolute gun, as in, you know, she doesn't let roadblocks.
[00:10:35] Gerard Donnelly: Imagine facing that.
[00:10:37] Gerard Donnelly: You've crashed, your bike's broken, and she's just not losing her mind.
[00:10:42] Gerard Donnelly: know, use that to add to Nancy.
[00:10:45] Gerard Donnelly: It's like, you here's a girl who's entering in the race, still motivated, still keen.
[00:10:52] Gerard Donnelly: You know, it's not panning out the way she wants, but, you know, she's going to finish this race.
[00:10:58] Gerard Donnelly: So, yeah, I was like, just.
[00:11:00] Abby Jorgensen: mean, I was like, people would kill to be in your position, so just enjoy it, enjoy the moments.
[00:11:08] Gerard Donnelly: Abby, she's just not an elite athlete, you know, she's, it doesn't matter to us whether you're a beginner or elite, but your pressure would be higher as an elite athlete, because the expectations of others, sponsors, you know, everything, where you're trying to earn an income, they've got different mindset, whereas everybody from the elite backwards should just be there to enjoy and improve and do their best.
[00:11:38] Gerard Donnelly: And, and that's the mindset that you'll race better that way.
[00:11:42] Gerard Donnelly: The way you approached your Ironman was absolutely brilliant.
[00:11:46] Gerard Donnelly: You listened, you, you had your plan, you stuck with it.
[00:11:52] Gerard Donnelly: He didn't lose the plot at any point that got hard, but you stuck with it.
[00:11:57] Gerard Donnelly: And then you had the time of your life running because you.
[00:12:00] Gerard Donnelly: actually executed the swim and the bike properly.
[00:12:04] Gerard Donnelly: And you should tell them that story.
[00:12:06] Gerard Donnelly: Talk about yourself.
[00:12:07] Abby Jorgensen: It's okay.
[00:12:10] Gerard Donnelly: And, you know, just say from my experience, you know, I just really followed the process.
[00:12:14] Gerard Donnelly: And I stayed in the moment.
[00:12:17] Gerard Donnelly: And you did a great job of doing that.
[00:12:20] Gerard Donnelly: So use examples when you're trying to explain your point.
[00:12:24] Gerard Donnelly: Yeah.
[00:12:25] Abby Jorgensen: Yeah.
[00:12:25] Abby Jorgensen: The 70.3s, I put too much pressure on myself and I didn't enjoy myself.
[00:12:29] Abby Jorgensen: So, whereas Ironman, I had a blast.
[00:12:32] Abby Jorgensen: So, yeah.
[00:12:33] Abby Jorgensen: Yeah.
[00:12:34] Gerard Donnelly: And, you know, that, that we needed to change your mindset.
[00:12:37] Gerard Donnelly: And that was the big talk I was having with you is, you know, you just, you just got to change your mindset about what's my job here.
[00:12:47] Gerard Donnelly: I'm lucky to be in this race.
[00:12:49] Gerard Donnelly: I'm lucky to make the start line.
[00:12:50] Gerard Donnelly: Like, you know, Fiona could probably, if she wanted to lose the plot and go, , I don't have a bike.
[00:12:55] Gerard Donnelly: You know, what am I supposed to do here?
[00:12:57] Gerard Donnelly: But now she's gone to the bike shop.
[00:12:59] Gerard Donnelly: Can I rent one?
[00:13:00] Gerard Donnelly: And, you know, and they found one for her, which, you know, she's never ridden before.
[00:13:04] Gerard Donnelly: It's just, you know, it's not going to stop her.
[00:13:09] Gerard Donnelly: So sometimes it's good for people to hear that story and then it puts it in perspective of, what am I worried about?
[00:13:17] Gerard Donnelly: This girl's, you know, being dealt a pretty savage blow here through no fault of her own, just by getting a puncture, doing the right thing, going, driven all the way out, freaking 60 mile drive out to where I got her to drive to, you know, and doing the recon.
[00:13:38] Gerard Donnelly: Just unlucky.
[00:13:40] Gerard Donnelly: It's probably, where's she from?
[00:13:41] Abby Jorgensen: Is it on the other side of the road too?
[00:13:44] Gerard Donnelly: Yeah, no, yeah, she's from Australia, yeah, for sure.
[00:13:48] Gerard Donnelly: Yeah.
[00:13:49] Gerard Donnelly: I just think getting a puncture is pretty unlucky, far out.
[00:13:52] Gerard Donnelly: But, yeah, it feels like, I don't know, like I've never, knock on wood, never had one.
[00:13:58] Abby Jorgensen: Yeah.
[00:14:00] Abby Jorgensen: Yeah.
[00:14:00] Abby Jorgensen: Yeah, it's better to get it in training.
[00:14:01] Gerard Donnelly: Anyway, let's jump into it.
[00:14:03] Gerard Donnelly: We might as start with Michael.
[00:14:07] Gerard Donnelly: Do you feel like you're communicating well with him?
[00:14:13] Abby Jorgensen: Yeah, because his schedule has been like all over the place.
[00:14:17] Abby Jorgensen: So he's messaging me a lot.
[00:14:20] Abby Jorgensen: But yeah, the 100 mile ride ended up getting cut short because it was storming and flooding and stuff like that.
[00:14:28] Abby Jorgensen: Yeah, he said like at one point they were like in water up to the cranks of their bikes and had to turn around.
[00:14:35] Abby Jorgensen: And I was like, well, it does not sound fun.
[00:14:38] Abby Jorgensen: I was like, oh, your power line doesn't look terrible.
[00:14:42] Gerard Donnelly: Was that a tornado at Florida, wasn't it?
[00:14:44] Abby Jorgensen: It was just, I think, just when you get torrential downpour along the coast.
[00:14:51] Gerard Donnelly: Geez, they have, like I've coached that guy for the Ironman at Florida like two years ago.
[00:14:57] Gerard Donnelly: He could hardly, there was not a weekend where there was.
[00:15:00] Gerard Donnelly: No interruption from weather.
[00:15:02] Gerard Donnelly: People go, oh, you've got to go to Florida for your holidays.
[00:15:05] Gerard Donnelly: Well, there must be some two good weeks somewhere during the year, but I couldn't find them.
[00:15:09] Abby Jorgensen: No, they always have the afternoon rain showers.
[00:15:14] Abby Jorgensen: I spent a summer there on an internship in college.
[00:15:18] Abby Jorgensen: I mean, it was nice, but yeah, it was always raining in the night.
[00:15:21] Abby Jorgensen: I think I made it through two hurricanes.
[00:15:25] Abby Jorgensen: I was like, I don't know who wants to live here, but who knows?
[00:15:30] Abby Jorgensen: So you're happy with him?
[00:15:31] Gerard Donnelly: Anything we need to discuss on him?
[00:15:34] Abby Jorgensen: No, it's just wrapping our heads around his schedule sometimes.
[00:15:39] Abby Jorgensen: Do you need help with that?
[00:15:40] Abby Jorgensen: You've got that under control.
[00:15:41] Abby Jorgensen: No, we've got it under control.
[00:15:43] Abby Jorgensen: It's just I told him he has to, I think volleyball, his daughter's volleyball is done this week, so that'll help because it frees up his nights.
[00:15:51] Abby Jorgensen: So he's not at, like this week it's playoffs, so he's like every night he has something.
[00:15:57] Gerard Donnelly: Yeah, just make sure they're gone because he's...
[00:16:00] Gerard Donnelly: He's training for a marathon.
[00:16:02] Gerard Donnelly: Just make sure that we keep progressing his run duration, okay?
[00:16:06] Gerard Donnelly: So we need to, you know, I'm not even sure what you've been doing, but each week we need.
[00:16:14] Gerard Donnelly: Because he hadn't been running, so he still has run walking.
[00:16:17] Gerard Donnelly: So just make sure that you're progressing that each week and keep progressing the long ride.
[00:16:25] Gerard Donnelly: So, okay?
[00:16:27] Gerard Donnelly: Yep.
[00:16:28] Gerard Donnelly: days where he's got more time, you know, throw in another ride, Abby.
[00:16:36] Gerard Donnelly: So, you know, if you think he's just still early days with the run walking, you know, it's okay to throw in another, you know, recovery ride on a Sunday before he goes running.
[00:16:47] Gerard Donnelly: Okay.
[00:16:48] Gerard Donnelly: Yeah, like a 20, 30-minute recovery ride, just so he gets used to, you know, another ride.
[00:16:56] Abby Jorgensen: Okay.
[00:16:57] Abby Jorgensen: Okay.
[00:16:58] Gerard Donnelly: Okay.
[00:16:59] Gerard Donnelly: Okay.
[00:16:59] Gerard Donnelly: Okay.
[00:16:59] Gerard Donnelly: Okay.
[00:16:59] Gerard Donnelly: Okay.
[00:16:59] Gerard Donnelly: Okay.
[00:16:59] Gerard Donnelly: Okay.
[00:16:59] Gerard Donnelly: You
[00:17:03] Abby Jorgensen: She's had some work stressors that I had to walk her through yesterday, but she recovered from the race.
[00:17:11] Abby Jorgensen: Yeah, it's just, let's see, she had some workshop this past weekend, so we had to move her session a little bit.
[00:17:21] Abby Jorgensen: But yeah, other than that, like, she's, her body's coping well with everything.
[00:17:26] Abby Jorgensen: It's just other stressors that are, she seems in the right mindset, and then she, like, this weekend, she kind of got into a hole.
[00:17:38] Abby Jorgensen: But I think, I told her, I think it's, everything she was telling me, I think it has to do with work and like that, so.
[00:17:45] Abby Jorgensen: Yep, okay.
[00:17:47] Gerard Donnelly: It's not far to Marbella.
[00:17:50] Gerard Donnelly: Yeah.
[00:17:54] Gerard Donnelly: So, her race-ready sessions, don't, don't be afraid.
[00:18:00] Gerard Donnelly: to give her alternating.
[00:18:04] Gerard Donnelly: That's great, well done, that's exactly right.
[00:18:08] Gerard Donnelly: So she did a half marathon, what date was that?
[00:18:12] Gerard Donnelly: That was 21st, so 21st, so where's her testing week?
[00:18:26] Gerard Donnelly: So test week this week, is it?
[00:18:27] Abby Jorgensen: It was this week.
[00:18:33] Gerard Donnelly: Yeah, I would probably get her to do a 10k run, rather than 10k run off the bike.
[00:18:45] Gerard Donnelly: I'd rather see her do a fresh 10k on the Sunday, with a long warm up and a long cool down.
[00:18:54] Gerard Donnelly: So she gets the 90 minute run in, but give her a 20 minute warm up.
[00:18:59] Gerard Donnelly: Okay.
[00:19:00] Gerard Donnelly: Okay.
[00:19:00] Gerard Donnelly: 10K run, and then 20, 30-minute cool down.
[00:19:04] Gerard Donnelly: And then what off?
[00:19:06] Abby Jorgensen: Anything off the bike on Saturday or no?
[00:19:08] Abby Jorgensen: Yeah, just 15 minutes.
[00:19:09] Abby Jorgensen: Just a job.
[00:19:19] Gerard Donnelly: So you got her doing retesting.
[00:19:24] Gerard Donnelly: Was she meant to have a bit of recovery or is it not a recovery?
[00:19:27] Abby Jorgensen: You told me to put a high intensity on Tuesday instead of recovery.
[00:19:34] Abby Jorgensen: And I debated because she had to move that race-ready session.
[00:19:38] Abby Jorgensen: Yes, okay.
[00:19:39] Abby Jorgensen: But she was like, oh, I won't do it until late Tuesday night.
[00:19:44] Abby Jorgensen: So she said that she should have plenty of recovery between when she did.
[00:19:48] Abby Jorgensen: Yeah.
[00:19:49] Gerard Donnelly: Well, that changes it when she's done that race-ready there, doesn't it?
[00:19:52] Gerard Donnelly: bit.
[00:19:52] Gerard Donnelly: Move that because of the weekend.
[00:19:54] Abby Jorgensen: And it was raining and stuff, too, their weather's return.
[00:19:59] Abby Jorgensen: Yeah.
[00:20:00] Gerard Donnelly: Yeah.
[00:20:00] Gerard Donnelly: Um, it's probably a bit much now, isn't it?
[00:20:08] Abby Jorgensen: Yeah, that's why I was like, I had changed it and she was like, I don't want to change it.
[00:20:13] Abby Jorgensen: don't want to keep the high intensity.
[00:20:14] Abby Jorgensen: I was like, I don't think you'll be recovered, but I don't know.
[00:20:19] Abby Jorgensen: She seems to recover no matter what, but.
[00:20:24] Abby Jorgensen: Yeah.
[00:20:26] Abby Jorgensen: It's hard to.
[00:20:30] Gerard Donnelly: Definitely, if she's going to do that, change Wednesday to.
[00:20:34] Gerard Donnelly: Recovery?
[00:20:35] Abby Jorgensen: Recovery, yeah.
[00:20:38] Abby Jorgensen: Yeah.
[00:20:44] Abby Jorgensen: Yeah.
[00:20:46] Abby Jorgensen: Yeah.
[00:20:49] Gerard Donnelly: So.
[00:20:54] Gerard Donnelly: Are you okay with that then?
[00:20:56] Gerard Donnelly: Yeah.
[00:20:58] Abby Jorgensen: So take out the Wednesday.
[00:20:59] Abby Jorgensen: Yeah.
[00:21:00] Gerard Donnelly: Take out the Wednesday and then take out the 10k and move it to a fresh 10k Sunday with a long warm up and cool down.
[00:21:09] Abby Jorgensen: Okay.
[00:21:21] Gerard Donnelly: The weather's starting to get cold there.
[00:21:24] Gerard Donnelly: Yeah, and wet.
[00:21:26] Abby Jorgensen: Yeah.
[00:21:29] Gerard Donnelly: Has she got access to Ruby?
[00:21:33] Abby Jorgensen: I can ask her if she's been using Swift, I think.
[00:21:37] Gerard Donnelly: So it would be good for her to get on the Marbella course if she could, if it's wet and cold.
[00:21:43] Abby Jorgensen: Okay.
[00:21:44] Gerard Donnelly: But if it's good weather, I'd rather she was outside.
[00:21:48] Gerard Donnelly: Yeah.
[00:21:49] Abby Jorgensen: Do they have the full course now?
[00:21:53] Abby Jorgensen: Yeah.
[00:21:53] Abby Jorgensen: Okay.
[00:21:54] Abby Jorgensen: Yeah.
[00:21:54] Abby Jorgensen: Apparently.
[00:21:56] Gerard Donnelly: I got told the other day, so.
[00:21:58] Abby Jorgensen: Okay.
[00:21:59] Abby Jorgensen: Thanks, Thanks.
[00:22:00] Gerard Donnelly: that
[00:22:04] Abby Jorgensen: I talked to him about goals, so he says there's a sprint Great Britain team, so his goal, maybe not 2026, but 2027, maybe, is to qualify for the age group team with sprint stuff.
[00:22:26] Abby Jorgensen: So, yeah, so that's kind of our goal after these two events here in October.
[00:22:34] Abby Jorgensen: Okay.
[00:22:39] Gerard Donnelly: Good.
[00:22:41] Gerard Donnelly: Andrew, how's he coming along?
[00:22:43] Gerard Donnelly: He's good.
[00:22:44] Abby Jorgensen: I mean, he still has some rib pain from the fall.
[00:22:47] Abby Jorgensen: Like today, he said after the swim, it's always, like, tight, but he's feeling more confident.
[00:22:55] Abby Jorgensen: Yeah, I think he said, too, he was just like, these weekends are starting to get long.
[00:23:00] Abby Jorgensen: And I was like, yep, like a couple more.
[00:23:03] Abby Jorgensen: just have a couple more and we'll, you're.
[00:23:10] Gerard Donnelly: Yeah, that's good.
[00:23:16] Gerard Donnelly: I just think that 32, you've got a 35, that's great.
[00:23:23] Gerard Donnelly: You've got that interval, so that's good.
[00:23:31] Gerard Donnelly: He just did 160, is that right?
[00:23:35] Gerard Donnelly: Yep.
[00:23:36] Gerard Donnelly: And he ran, and then he ran.
[00:23:39] Abby Jorgensen: Yeah, he had a good run on Sunday.
[00:23:42] Abby Jorgensen: Interesting.
[00:23:44] Gerard Donnelly: Maybe, maybe next week, Abby, just, just push that run a little bit further, if you could.
[00:23:50] Gerard Donnelly: Okay, like an hour 15?
[00:23:52] Gerard Donnelly: Yeah, give him an hour, an hour to an hour 15, somewhere around there.
[00:24:07] Gerard Donnelly: That's good.
[00:24:11] Gerard Donnelly: Anything else on Andrew?
[00:24:13] Gerard Donnelly: Nope.
[00:24:14] Abby Jorgensen: Good.
[00:24:17] Gerard Donnelly: James just started.
[00:24:18] Gerard Donnelly: Yep.
[00:24:19] Gerard Donnelly: I saw he did a really well executed FTP.
[00:24:23] Gerard Donnelly: Yep.
[00:24:25] Gerard Donnelly: That was good.
[00:24:25] Gerard Donnelly: And how's the feedback with him?
[00:24:29] Gerard Donnelly: Good.
[00:24:29] Abby Jorgensen: mean, we've been communicating mostly by text right now.
[00:24:32] Abby Jorgensen: We've been struggling to find a time to get on the phone together.
[00:24:38] Abby Jorgensen: But he's a busy guy.
[00:24:41] Abby Jorgensen: I don't know.
[00:24:42] Abby Jorgensen: What's do for work?
[00:24:44] Abby Jorgensen: Did he ever say?
[00:24:45] Abby Jorgensen: No, he didn't say no.
[00:24:47] Gerard Donnelly: I think he said IT or something.
[00:24:50] Gerard Donnelly: Okay.
[00:24:51] Gerard Donnelly: Maybe.
[00:24:52] Abby Jorgensen: Yeah.
[00:24:54] Gerard Donnelly: Yeah.
[00:24:55] Gerard Donnelly: So I saw he didn't really do a 1K time trial.
[00:25:01] Gerard Donnelly: Yeah, don't know.
[00:25:02] Gerard Donnelly: couldn't figure out where.
[00:25:04] Gerard Donnelly: It was like nine minutes early.
[00:25:08] Gerard Donnelly: And then he did 15 minutes.
[00:25:10] Gerard Donnelly: Is that what it is with us?
[00:25:12] Gerard Donnelly: That might be it.
[00:25:14] Gerard Donnelly: Yeah, but like, if you look at, where's the, it looks continuous.
[00:25:20] Abby Jorgensen: So that's why I don't know.
[00:25:22] Gerard Donnelly: I think he just had a seven second rate rest, I think.
[00:25:26] Gerard Donnelly: So he's done 400 and then he's done 600.
[00:25:31] Gerard Donnelly: So, I think he's actually done it.
[00:25:33] Gerard Donnelly: So, I think.
[00:25:37] Abby Jorgensen: I think I had like, I tried to find it.
[00:25:42] Abby Jorgensen: I think it was like a two.
[00:25:49] Abby Jorgensen: Yeah.
[00:25:50] Abby Jorgensen: 15.
[00:25:51] Gerard Donnelly: 15 goes from now.
[00:25:52] Gerard Donnelly: There it is.
[00:25:53] Gerard Donnelly: Right.
[00:25:54] Gerard Donnelly: That's it there.
[00:25:55] Abby Jorgensen: That's roughly about it.
[00:25:58] Gerard Donnelly: So, yeah, I've got that 25 minutes.
[00:26:00] Gerard Donnelly: So he's 227.
[00:26:02] Gerard Donnelly: He's a shocker, but that's okay.
[00:26:03] Gerard Donnelly: Yeah.
[00:26:05] Abby Jorgensen: Good.
[00:26:06] Gerard Donnelly: And then he ran the 10K.
[00:26:08] Gerard Donnelly: He just did that tonight or I guess today or whatever.
[00:26:13] Gerard Donnelly: Did you see the course he rides on?
[00:26:23] Abby Jorgensen: It's like an eight-minute out and back.
[00:26:27] Abby Jorgensen: Did you see?
[00:26:28] Abby Jorgensen: Yeah, said he couldn't get his power to work correctly on the bike.
[00:26:34] Gerard Donnelly: So pretty much he starts here and it's three minutes out and then kind of three minutes back.
[00:26:50] Gerard Donnelly: So it's nine minutes altogether.
[00:26:52] Gerard Donnelly: He just keeps repeating that.
[00:26:55] Gerard Donnelly: Dang.
[00:26:56] Abby Jorgensen: Dang.
[00:26:59] Gerard Donnelly: He's a good He's
[00:27:02] Gerard Donnelly: Is it always warm there or what's the, what's the, it's just that Malta is just, it's only like 15 miles from there to there.
[00:27:14] Abby Jorgensen: That's crazy.
[00:27:15] Gerard Donnelly: And so I was in, I was in Syracuse for, during the summer, this is Sicily, and Malta is, you can't even see it, you know, it's, this is a beautiful place to ride, this is where we were, but, but, you know, it's just tiny, it's a little block in the Mediterranean.
[00:27:45] Gerard Donnelly: So that's a hard thing, but, but yeah, if he gets any opportunity to go onto the mainland at Sicily, Abby, then, then ask him, you know.
[00:28:00] Abby Jorgensen: Is it just a flight, or is it like a boat flight?
[00:28:05] Gerard Donnelly: It's definitely a flight, I think a 30-minute flight or something.
[00:28:10] Gerard Donnelly: But otherwise, again, you would try to find if he's using Zwift or – I think he is using Zwift, but yeah, see if he wants to do Ruby and do some indoor stuff there.
[00:28:27] Gerard Donnelly: You don't want him to be held at the one power range.
[00:28:30] Gerard Donnelly: You want him on undulating courses so that he has to change gears indoor.
[00:28:37] Gerard Donnelly: You know how we've discussed how when you load training peaks onto Zwift, it nullifies all the hills, which is pretty useless.
[00:28:46] Gerard Donnelly: You can't sit there for two, three hours without changing gears.
[00:28:51] Gerard Donnelly: You need an interactive course.
[00:28:56] Gerard Donnelly: So that's the discussion I'm having with everybody that I'm coaching.
[00:28:59] Gerard Donnelly: we're is – It
[00:29:00] Gerard Donnelly: You're going to do indoor, you either do the training peak session that we give you, like you just did, or you do a Ruby course where you can select the Turkey 70.3, or you just find a course that's got undulations where you're actually being stimulated to change gears when you go up a hill and down a hill and try to stay in the range.
[00:29:22] Gerard Donnelly: But just don't ride, you know, a straight two hours at 180 watts.
[00:29:30] Abby Jorgensen: That's all boring.
[00:29:32] Abby Jorgensen: It's not what we want.
[00:29:34] Gerard Donnelly: You know, it's actually, it's not that beneficial for what we're trying to achieve.
[00:29:40] Gerard Donnelly: So we're trying to get people to learn how to ride in the ranges, and it's easy to do that sitting on a trainer when you're not being stimulated by changes in gradient.
[00:29:48] Gerard Donnelly: So it's not really testing them.
[00:29:52] Gerard Donnelly: So, yeah.
[00:29:54] Gerard Donnelly: Anything with James since he started that you?
[00:29:56] Abby Jorgensen: No, mean, we've, he's communicated really well, and yeah.
[00:30:00] Abby Jorgensen: Yeah.
[00:30:00] Gerard Donnelly: Just make sure he's changed all his settings and make sure that's all right.
[00:30:06] Abby Jorgensen: Yeah, sent him a video of everything.
[00:30:08] Abby Jorgensen: hopefully.
[00:30:09] Gerard Donnelly: Yeah, fantastic.
[00:30:11] Gerard Donnelly: All right.
[00:30:12] Gerard Donnelly: Cynthia, she's still off.
[00:30:14] Abby Jorgensen: Yeah, she texted me the other day, actually, just kind of filled me in.
[00:30:17] Abby Jorgensen: And she had, I'm trying to remember what it was.
[00:30:20] Abby Jorgensen: Oh, meniscus issue.
[00:30:24] Abby Jorgensen: She found out.
[00:30:25] Abby Jorgensen: So she's working with the PT to get the meniscus figured out.
[00:30:30] Abby Jorgensen: They don't know if they want to do surgery yet or not.
[00:30:32] Abby Jorgensen: But she's still cycling and swimming.
[00:30:35] Gerard Donnelly: Like, why is she off the program?
[00:30:37] Gerard Donnelly: I don't know.
[00:30:38] Abby Jorgensen: I'm trying to think.
[00:30:39] Abby Jorgensen: I might have deleted her text.
[00:30:47] Abby Jorgensen: Yeah, she's going to Marbello no matter what.
[00:30:49] Abby Jorgensen: She's like, I might just swim and call it good.
[00:30:53] Abby Jorgensen: Just to enjoy the experience because she's already booked everything.
[00:30:58] Abby Jorgensen: She rode on Friday.
[00:30:59] Gerard Donnelly: No, she rode outdoors.
[00:31:00] Gerard Donnelly: She
[00:31:09] Gerard Donnelly: I think you should respond saying, look, great to see you training, you know, do you want us to help guide you, if you can still, your knee mustn't be that bad if you're still riding.
[00:31:22] Abby Jorgensen: I don't think she's running, is she running?
[00:31:24] Abby Jorgensen: I don't think running.
[00:31:29] Gerard Donnelly: She should do, you know, she should do Marbella as an aqua bike.
[00:31:33] Gerard Donnelly: She should really just go flat out and swim in the ride.
[00:31:38] Gerard Donnelly: She's going there anyway.
[00:31:40] Gerard Donnelly: She should let us help her prepare for that.
[00:31:43] Gerard Donnelly: Yeah, reach out to her, Abby.
[00:31:45] Gerard Donnelly: Okay.
[00:31:50] Gerard Donnelly: Izzy?
[00:31:52] Abby Jorgensen: I had a call with her, whatever, last Thursday?
[00:31:57] Abby Jorgensen: Yeah, I walked her through, walked her through.
[00:32:01] Abby Jorgensen: How to car blow properly, and then just her, you know, pacing a little bit.
[00:32:10] Abby Jorgensen: And I told her about the, I couldn't remember at first, since she's from there, I was like, it's the hills.
[00:32:17] Abby Jorgensen: And then I finally remembered, I was like, was botanical.
[00:32:20] Abby Jorgensen: She's like, oh, the tan.
[00:32:21] Abby Jorgensen: And I was like, yes, it ends in the tan.
[00:32:23] Abby Jorgensen: And she's like, oh, I didn't know that.
[00:32:24] Abby Jorgensen: I was like, how do you not know that?
[00:32:26] Abby Jorgensen: In my head, I was like, you think you would know that.
[00:32:30] Gerard Donnelly: Well, doesn't actually end at the tan.
[00:32:33] Gerard Donnelly: It ends in the stadium.
[00:32:35] Gerard Donnelly: Yeah, she said it ends in a stadium.
[00:32:37] Abby Jorgensen: And I'm like, that's kind of cool.
[00:32:39] Gerard Donnelly: It's the MCG is the big iconic ground of Australia.
[00:32:44] Gerard Donnelly: It's that they have that's where they have all their football finals, 105,000 people.
[00:32:49] Gerard Donnelly: It fits and it's a big iconic stadium.
[00:32:54] Gerard Donnelly: And look, around the world, people really know the MCG from and from
[00:33:01] Gerard Donnelly: Cricket.
[00:33:02] Gerard Donnelly: So Australia play England in cricket at the MCG and it gets packed, you know, it has a five-day match.
[00:33:09] Gerard Donnelly: It's a five-day match.
[00:33:10] Gerard Donnelly: Can you believe that?
[00:33:10] Gerard Donnelly: Cricket goes for five days.
[00:33:12] Gerard Donnelly: Oh, you never really.
[00:33:13] Gerard Donnelly: And they get 100,000, you know, most days.
[00:33:17] Gerard Donnelly: Crazy.
[00:33:19] Gerard Donnelly: So, yeah, so her half marathon best pace was last August, this August, sorry.
[00:33:26] Gerard Donnelly: So she's, yeah, so it's not an easy one for her to, is she done?
[00:33:33] Gerard Donnelly: She did a, where'd she run that?
[00:33:39] Abby Jorgensen: I don't know.
[00:33:40] Abby Jorgensen: She likes to run longer than I tell her to.
[00:33:42] Abby Jorgensen: She did Sydney marathon, did she?
[00:33:44] Gerard Donnelly: Yeah, did Sydney.
[00:33:45] Gerard Donnelly: Yeah, okay.
[00:33:46] Abby Jorgensen: I'll use that as an example of.
[00:33:50] Gerard Donnelly: Yeah, we kind of used, we talked through that.
[00:33:52] Abby Jorgensen: She, she realized she started.
[00:33:55] Abby Jorgensen: Too hard.
[00:33:56] Abby Jorgensen: Too hard.
[00:33:57] Abby Jorgensen: So.
[00:33:58] Abby Jorgensen: Yeah.
[00:33:58] Abby Jorgensen: Yeah.
[00:34:00] Abby Jorgensen: Yeah.
[00:34:01] Gerard Donnelly: Yeah, geez.
[00:34:04] Gerard Donnelly: Oh, that's agony.
[00:34:06] Gerard Donnelly: She must be running so slowly, Abby.
[00:34:09] Gerard Donnelly: I can't even imagine you run that slow.
[00:34:11] Gerard Donnelly: Me neither.
[00:34:11] Abby Jorgensen: I've tried to run slow, and it's like a shuffle.
[00:34:17] Abby Jorgensen: That's like 14-minute mile pace.
[00:34:19] Abby Jorgensen: I mean, I have a pretty high cadence, so slowing down makes it feel awkward.
[00:34:23] Abby Jorgensen: Yeah.
[00:34:28] Gerard Donnelly: Anyway, it's incredible that you've got us training.
[00:34:31] Abby Jorgensen: So she claims she's super motivated for everything, so we'll see.
[00:34:36] Abby Jorgensen: That's good.
[00:34:37] Abby Jorgensen: You're the best thing that's happened to her, basically.
[00:34:39] Abby Jorgensen: Yeah.
[00:34:41] Abby Jorgensen: Well, well done to you.
[00:34:43] Abby Jorgensen: Kevin's doing good.
[00:34:44] Abby Jorgensen: I had a call with him, and he just, you know, he wants to – he's super excited, but then he was like – and then he was like texting me the next day.
[00:34:52] Abby Jorgensen: He's like, oh, they're sending me to Thailand, and there's like no place to do anything there, he said.
[00:34:57] Abby Jorgensen: So we're just – I was
[00:35:01] Abby Jorgensen: Like, no gym, and he's like, the last time I was there was an hour away, and we get off so late that there's no chance for me.
[00:35:08] Abby Jorgensen: That's fine.
[00:35:09] Abby Jorgensen: Yeah.
[00:35:11] Gerard Donnelly: And he can't run with his injury, can he?
[00:35:13] Gerard Donnelly: Yeah.
[00:35:13] Gerard Donnelly: Nope.
[00:35:15] Abby Jorgensen: So we're kind of stuck.
[00:35:16] Abby Jorgensen: Yep.
[00:35:17] Gerard Donnelly: So this is week two, just finished, and you're starting week three.
[00:35:22] Abby Jorgensen: Well, it should be a retest week.
[00:35:24] Abby Jorgensen: Right, okay.
[00:35:26] Gerard Donnelly: Oh, wait.
[00:35:26] Abby Jorgensen: Wait, no, he got his power meter in, so we were going to test him.
[00:35:31] Abby Jorgensen: Because he felt really strong.
[00:35:34] Abby Jorgensen: He's like, he compared them, and they're about seven watts off.
[00:35:37] Abby Jorgensen: Yeah, okay.
[00:35:38] Abby Jorgensen: But, yeah.
[00:35:40] Gerard Donnelly: So maybe give him a block of training here.
[00:35:44] Gerard Donnelly: Yeah.
[00:35:45] Gerard Donnelly: And then, and then give him, because you're going to have a week off here.
[00:35:51] Gerard Donnelly: So, so I would, I would test him there like you're doing, and then start another block.
[00:36:00] Gerard Donnelly: Okay.
[00:36:01] Gerard Donnelly: That's what I had planned on.
[00:36:03] Abby Jorgensen: Okay.
[00:36:04] Gerard Donnelly: Richard?
[00:36:07] Abby Jorgensen: Good.
[00:36:08] Abby Jorgensen: You're just...
[00:36:09] Abby Jorgensen: He also texted me his goal for next year.
[00:36:21] Gerard Donnelly: How did he test?
[00:36:24] Abby Jorgensen: Slightly lower, like five watts.
[00:36:29] Abby Jorgensen: Has he been training okay, Abby?
[00:36:32] Gerard Donnelly: Yeah, he's been.
[00:36:33] Abby Jorgensen: There was one week I lowered his percent a little bit because he was struggling hitting it.
[00:36:39] Abby Jorgensen: Yeah.
[00:36:41] Abby Jorgensen: I think he's going too hard too early, has he?
[00:36:45] Gerard Donnelly: Yeah.
[00:36:46] Abby Jorgensen: Yeah.
[00:36:47] Abby Jorgensen: Here.
[00:36:47] Abby Jorgensen: 199, first five minutes.
[00:36:53] Gerard Donnelly: Yeah.
[00:36:55] Gerard Donnelly: But it's also...
[00:36:56] Abby Jorgensen: Yeah, it was...
[00:36:59] Abby Jorgensen: I don't know if just there's...
[00:37:01] Abby Jorgensen: A little bit of fatigue built up or what?
[00:37:03] Gerard Donnelly: Yeah, I think he's just gone too hard too early.
[00:37:09] Gerard Donnelly: Yeah, he needed to start a little bit less aggressively.
[00:37:15] Gerard Donnelly: Like his best effort last month was 2.01, and he's got, in the first sort of seven minutes, he's got 2.02.
[00:37:25] Gerard Donnelly: So I think he needs to, you know, he should start in the 1.95.
[00:37:30] Gerard Donnelly: Okay.
[00:37:31] Gerard Donnelly: It's not too bad, but he's jumped up too quick.
[00:37:37] Gerard Donnelly: Yeah.
[00:37:38] Abby Jorgensen: Yeah, he wants to do a triathlon in March.
[00:37:47] Abby Jorgensen: Yeah.
[00:37:48] Abby Jorgensen: Like an Olympic distance.
[00:37:50] Abby Jorgensen: Olympic distance, great.
[00:37:51] Abby Jorgensen: Yeah.
[00:37:59] Gerard Donnelly: Eri.
[00:38:00] Gerard Donnelly: Eri.
[00:38:00] Gerard Donnelly: Eri.
[00:38:00] Gerard Donnelly: Eri.
[00:38:00] Gerard Donnelly: you.
[00:38:01] Gerard Donnelly: The swim is shorter, though.
[00:38:02] Abby Jorgensen: It's only 800 yards, but everything else is normal.
[00:38:05] Abby Jorgensen: Yeah.
[00:38:08] Gerard Donnelly: Okay.
[00:38:10] Gerard Donnelly: Mikayla?
[00:38:13] Abby Jorgensen: We're one more week here.
[00:38:15] Abby Jorgensen: I up some of the intensity, but then next week we're going to retest.
[00:38:19] Abby Jorgensen: Or this week, I guess.
[00:38:21] Abby Jorgensen: This week we're testing and then going to start into a new block.
[00:38:25] Abby Jorgensen: Yeah.
[00:38:25] Gerard Donnelly: And has she got any races for the summer?
[00:38:28] Abby Jorgensen: Um, yeah.
[00:38:31] Abby Jorgensen: So, let's see.
[00:38:35] Abby Jorgensen: Tiananmen triathlon.
[00:38:36] Abby Jorgensen: Yeah, good.
[00:38:36] Gerard Donnelly: She's got a whole heap put down.
[00:38:39] Gerard Donnelly: Yeah, she already has everything.
[00:38:40] Abby Jorgensen: We already have everything planned out for maybe some smaller ones.
[00:38:45] Abby Jorgensen: That's good.
[00:38:46] Abby Jorgensen: Challenge in February.
[00:38:47] Abby Jorgensen: That's great.
[00:38:50] Abby Jorgensen: She was like, you should come, you should fly to New Zealand and do this with me.
[00:38:54] Abby Jorgensen: I was like, are you going to fly me there?
[00:38:57] Abby Jorgensen: Cause.
[00:39:00] Gerard Donnelly: And she's going to do worse than she.
[00:39:01] Gerard Donnelly: Neil again in May.
[00:39:02] Gerard Donnelly: Yep.
[00:39:03] Abby Jorgensen: Fantastic.
[00:39:06] Gerard Donnelly: That's good.
[00:39:09] Gerard Donnelly: All right.
[00:39:10] Gerard Donnelly: You've done a good job with her.
[00:39:11] Gerard Donnelly: I'm really happy.
[00:39:12] Gerard Donnelly: That's great.
[00:39:14] Gerard Donnelly: Rihanna.
[00:39:15] Abby Jorgensen: Well, you know, Rihanna, she claims this week she's going to.
[00:39:21] Gerard Donnelly: She's got to be the least enjoyable athlete to coach, I reckon.
[00:39:26] Abby Jorgensen: Yeah, I mean, she's one of them that I'm just like, she claims she got a promotion and she's going to have less, like more time to train.
[00:39:36] Abby Jorgensen: So I don't know.
[00:39:37] Abby Jorgensen: I don't know how that's ever worked, getting a promotion and having more time.
[00:39:41] Gerard Donnelly: But Abby, I reckon if you just, she keeps talking the talk, but she never actually does it.
[00:39:53] Gerard Donnelly: I think if you thinned back her training just to do, hey, Rihanna, one session.
[00:40:01] Abby Jorgensen: Per day, please.
[00:40:02] Gerard Donnelly: Just, and you've pretty much done that.
[00:40:05] Gerard Donnelly: Yeah, I mean, I've tried.
[00:40:08] Gerard Donnelly: I'd just go, right, swim, ride, run, ride, I don't know, you can swap that round, but I just, I would be not, I'd just get rid of two swims, just do one, do three rides and three, three bikes and three runs, okay?
[00:40:27] Gerard Donnelly: So I'd say, okay, are going to miss the swim?
[00:40:30] Abby Jorgensen: Swim luck.
[00:40:31] Abby Jorgensen: She's doing swim lessons with, on Thursday with some, I don't know, somebody in Boulder that's, I guess, works with all the triathletes there in Boulder, so.
[00:40:45] Abby Jorgensen: But she hasn't done any.
[00:40:46] Abby Jorgensen: Yeah, I don't know why she doesn't log the swimming.
[00:40:50] Abby Jorgensen: Did she do them or?
[00:40:52] Abby Jorgensen: She's done a couple swim, or like one session with this lady, and then she's doing one this Thursday, she said.
[00:41:00] Abby Jorgensen: a swim, a a a or or she's done
[00:41:01] Gerard Donnelly: First Thursday, and that's in August the 21st.
[00:41:06] Abby Jorgensen: So she hasn't done one.
[00:41:07] Abby Jorgensen: The crazy thing is her new, like, their new, like, apartment or condo or whatever they got has, like, a 25-yard pool at her place.
[00:41:19] Abby Jorgensen: She's so excited about it.
[00:41:21] Abby Jorgensen: then, like, I've – Get in it.
[00:41:24] Gerard Donnelly: I mean, I guess it's getting colder there now, but still, like – So I would just say one swim and make that the Thursday and then get her to do, you know, if she trains hard on the weekend for the long stuff, get her to do, you know, an easy run on the Monday and then do a Tuesday like you've got, then Wednesday run, Thursday swim, Friday ride, Saturday run like you've got Sunday.
[00:41:56] Gerard Donnelly: So just get rid of this.
[00:41:59] Gerard Donnelly: I would just say to her, listen.
[00:42:01] Gerard Donnelly: You're not going to be able to do anything with your training unless you start training.
[00:42:08] Gerard Donnelly: You have to kind of say to her, look, you know, in the last three weeks, she's literally done a half marathon, one ride, a recovery ride, not tested.
[00:42:30] Gerard Donnelly: I wouldn't let her do any sessions, Abby, until, you know, I'd swap that to here.
[00:42:37] Abby Jorgensen: How could she do that?
[00:42:38] Gerard Donnelly: She doesn't even know what her numbers are.
[00:42:40] Gerard Donnelly: It's been that long since she's ridden a bike.
[00:42:43] Abby Jorgensen: I think I actually did that last, she texted me late last night, and I just, she's like, I promised to do it this week.
[00:42:49] Abby Jorgensen: So I, like, moved some things around late last night, and I was like, okay.
[00:42:57] Gerard Donnelly: So I'd change that, Abby, just to a Zone 2 tomorrow.
[00:43:13] Abby Jorgensen: She said she was going to ride somewhere in Boulder on Wednesday.
[00:43:19] Abby Jorgensen: That's why I put this on Wednesday.
[00:43:22] Gerard Donnelly: Okay, why don't you change, if she's doing that, why don't you just message her saying you've spoken to me, and you've discussed it, that if you're going to ride in Boulder on Wednesday, you need to run on Tuesday, okay, and then do your FTP on Friday.
[00:43:39] Abby Jorgensen: Yeah, okay.
[00:43:41] Abby Jorgensen: So I'll just change that for you, all right?
[00:43:45] Gerard Donnelly: Okay, Blair?
[00:43:48] Gerard Donnelly: Yeah, he's doing good.
[00:43:49] Abby Jorgensen: He just, back to some consistency.
[00:43:55] Gerard Donnelly: Right.
[00:43:58] Gerard Donnelly: So, is he starting?
[00:44:01] Gerard Donnelly: starting?
[00:44:01] Gerard Donnelly: He's week two, all right?
[00:44:04] Gerard Donnelly: And he's hitting the sessions okay?
[00:44:06] Gerard Donnelly: You're happy with?
[00:44:07] Abby Jorgensen: Yep.
[00:44:09] Abby Jorgensen: He was above most of his numbers last week, I believe, if I remember correctly.
[00:44:14] Abby Jorgensen: Yep.
[00:44:15] Gerard Donnelly: And he's not missing anything.
[00:44:17] Gerard Donnelly: It's great.
[00:44:18] Gerard Donnelly: What a difference.
[00:44:21] Gerard Donnelly: Well done.
[00:44:24] Gerard Donnelly: Fantastic.
[00:44:26] Gerard Donnelly: He's easy.
[00:44:27] Gerard Donnelly: Glenn?
[00:44:29] Gerard Donnelly: Glenn?
[00:44:33] Abby Jorgensen: He's doing – the problem right now is his wedding is next week.
[00:44:39] Abby Jorgensen: So he has family and everything in town.
[00:44:43] Abby Jorgensen: Yep.
[00:44:44] Abby Jorgensen: But other than that, I mean, he – something – he didn't finish all the session on Sunday.
[00:44:53] Abby Jorgensen: said he was really fatigued.
[00:44:55] Abby Jorgensen: I mean, he did most of it, but he was frustrated with himself.
[00:44:59] Abby Jorgensen: So, Yeah.
[00:45:05] Abby Jorgensen: But I was like, I mean, I guess now that I know that your wedding is coming up, you have a lot going on.
[00:45:10] Abby Jorgensen: But at the same time, he started off a little.
[00:45:16] Abby Jorgensen: It's not too bad, is it?
[00:45:18] Gerard Donnelly: Yeah, he was doing good towards the end.
[00:45:23] Gerard Donnelly: It's getting hot there again.
[00:45:25] Abby Jorgensen: Yeah, that's what he said.
[00:45:25] Abby Jorgensen: That's why he bought a treadmill.
[00:45:29] Abby Jorgensen: But I told him if he's going to do indoor runs, kind of like you told me, I was like, go outside for 15 minutes and come back in or something.
[00:45:48] Gerard Donnelly: He's going to be underdone if he doesn't do those long run distances that you're giving him.
[00:45:55] Abby Jorgensen: You know what I mean?
[00:45:57] Gerard Donnelly: Every time you give him 26k, he does 20.
[00:46:00] Gerard Donnelly: 20, does 20.
[00:46:01] Gerard Donnelly: You're just continually underdoing what you're supposed to be doing.
[00:46:07] Gerard Donnelly: That's good.
[00:46:07] Gerard Donnelly: You did the week before.
[00:46:09] Gerard Donnelly: Yeah.
[00:46:12] Abby Jorgensen: I mean, he's super motivated.
[00:46:14] Abby Jorgensen: I think he's, I don't know.
[00:46:15] Abby Jorgensen: Yeah, he said it like fatigued this past week.
[00:46:18] Abby Jorgensen: So I don't.
[00:46:20] Abby Jorgensen: Yep.
[00:46:29] Gerard Donnelly: So he's getting married on Tuesday.
[00:46:31] Gerard Donnelly: Is that right?
[00:46:32] Abby Jorgensen: Yeah, which seems weird to me, but I don't know how things happen there.
[00:46:38] Abby Jorgensen: Usually people here get married on the weekends.
[00:46:40] Abby Jorgensen: And he wants to train on Tuesday morning.
[00:46:43] Gerard Donnelly: Yeah, that's what he told me.
[00:46:44] Abby Jorgensen: He's like, give me something easy Tuesday morning and then nothing on Wednesday.
[00:46:52] Gerard Donnelly: Yeah, good.
[00:46:53] Gerard Donnelly: That's all right.
[00:46:54] Gerard Donnelly: Okay.
[00:46:56] Gerard Donnelly: Mark, who's new?
[00:46:57] Gerard Donnelly: Mark Kroll?
[00:46:58] Gerard Donnelly: Yep.
[00:46:59] Gerard Donnelly: He just retested this past week.
[00:47:00] Abby Jorgensen: He He
[00:47:01] Abby Jorgensen: I think 17-watt improvement, almost a minute on a swim, and then this was his first run test.
[00:47:10] Abby Jorgensen: Yes.
[00:47:12] Abby Jorgensen: Oh, my dog's doing stuff.
[00:47:15] Abby Jorgensen: Oh, that's exciting that he's improved.
[00:47:18] Gerard Donnelly: Yeah, like, is this normal?
[00:47:20] Abby Jorgensen: Like, is this normal for everybody?
[00:47:21] Abby Jorgensen: I was like, I mean, for your first retest, it was awesome.
[00:47:31] Gerard Donnelly: Yeah, you're just checking everything's right with his calibration and in the position, time trial position.
[00:47:41] Gerard Donnelly: Is he on a road bike, is he?
[00:47:44] Abby Jorgensen: No, I think he has a time trial bike.
[00:47:47] Abby Jorgensen: Yeah, great.
[00:47:48] Abby Jorgensen: Because, yeah, he's done a 70.3 before.
[00:47:51] Abby Jorgensen: Oh, yeah.
[00:47:57] Gerard Donnelly: Yeah, that's really good, Abby.
[00:48:00] Abby Jorgensen: But, yeah, his run is.
[00:48:01] Abby Jorgensen: was really good, too.
[00:48:02] Abby Jorgensen: We just tested his 10K.
[00:48:03] Abby Jorgensen: I want to say it was like a 7.37 pace for minutes per mile.
[00:48:08] Abby Jorgensen: So that's what, something?
[00:48:10] Abby Jorgensen: I don't know.
[00:48:18] Gerard Donnelly: 4.44 pace.
[00:48:21] Gerard Donnelly: So he's around 47, and that's a PB.
[00:48:27] Gerard Donnelly: I don't know, he's done something back in February, in January.
[00:48:34] Abby Jorgensen: And then he got a calf injury.
[00:48:40] Gerard Donnelly: His execution is really good.
[00:48:46] Abby Jorgensen: Yeah, he wants one that he, yeah.
[00:48:48] Abby Jorgensen: Yeah, that's great.
[00:48:53] Abby Jorgensen: And then he has a half marathon November 2nd.
[00:48:57] Abby Jorgensen: Yep.
[00:48:57] Abby Jorgensen: Yep.
[00:49:02] Gerard Donnelly: That's good.
[00:49:05] Gerard Donnelly: He faded a little bit.
[00:49:06] Gerard Donnelly: Was there a hill there, is there?
[00:49:09] Gerard Donnelly: No, you dropped off a bit.
[00:49:14] Gerard Donnelly: That's not too bad.
[00:49:15] Gerard Donnelly: That's really good.
[00:49:18] Gerard Donnelly: Happy days.
[00:49:19] Gerard Donnelly: Yep.
[00:49:25] Gerard Donnelly: Good.
[00:49:26] Gerard Donnelly: And yeah, he seems like he's coping with everything you're giving him.
[00:49:31] Abby Jorgensen: Yep.
[00:49:32] Abby Jorgensen: He felt fatigue in week three, but I was like, that's normal.
[00:49:37] Abby Jorgensen: Then we deload.
[00:49:42] Gerard Donnelly: He has Saturdays off, doesn't he?
[00:49:44] Gerard Donnelly: Yeah.
[00:49:45] Abby Jorgensen: He's done a couple of late Saturdays because of, however, the sun is going down quicker here.
[00:49:51] Abby Jorgensen: So I guess it doesn't get, it gets dark around, I don't know, 637 now.
[00:50:01] Gerard Donnelly: Yeah, just keep progressing his long run.
[00:50:08] Gerard Donnelly: He's doing threshold and VO2.
[00:50:11] Gerard Donnelly: Fantastic.
[00:50:12] Gerard Donnelly: Long run.
[00:50:13] Gerard Donnelly: That's good.
[00:50:15] Gerard Donnelly: And then I added steady state because now that we have enough number.
[00:50:21] Abby Jorgensen: Yep.
[00:50:22] Gerard Donnelly: Well done.
[00:50:23] Gerard Donnelly: That's good.
[00:50:25] Gerard Donnelly: Okay.
[00:50:26] Gerard Donnelly: Philippe?
[00:50:29] Abby Jorgensen: Yeah, he's good.
[00:50:30] Abby Jorgensen: We've talked about, I mean, he has goals for next year.
[00:50:33] Abby Jorgensen: He is coming into his hunting season, so a lot of the weekends.
[00:50:37] Abby Jorgensen: And then ski season for him, too.
[00:50:43] Abby Jorgensen: So we'll say, I'll say, we'd work around, obviously, the weekend stuff.
[00:50:47] Abby Jorgensen: But doing a lot of skiing, too, will help.
[00:50:50] Abby Jorgensen: It will help.
[00:50:51] Abby Jorgensen: Yeah.
[00:50:53] Gerard Donnelly: How'd he go with his FTP?
[00:50:55] Gerard Donnelly: Oh, geez, he's jumped up.
[00:50:56] Abby Jorgensen: That's great.
[00:50:58] Abby Jorgensen: Geez.
[00:51:00] Gerard Donnelly: Hey, James.
[00:51:02] Gerard Donnelly: Yeah, same with his run, I believe, was faster too.
[00:51:06] Gerard Donnelly: He's done 33 watts since July, improvement.
[00:51:12] Abby Jorgensen: Yeah, he's been really happy with the program.
[00:51:16] Gerard Donnelly: So 10k in July, he did 53 minutes.
[00:51:32] Gerard Donnelly: He's 62 minutes 11 months ago.
[00:51:34] Gerard Donnelly: That's a great comment.
[00:51:37] Gerard Donnelly: He's improved 10 minutes in 11 months.
[00:51:41] Gerard Donnelly: Did you read that comment, right?
[00:51:45] Abby Jorgensen: Yeah, I read that because then he, what did he text me?
[00:51:48] Abby Jorgensen: I was like, you got to put it in perspective like you did in your comments.
[00:51:51] Abby Jorgensen: You're 10 minutes faster.
[00:51:53] Abby Jorgensen: Yeah.
[00:51:54] Abby Jorgensen: Or something like that.
[00:51:55] Abby Jorgensen: Yeah.
[00:52:04] Gerard Donnelly: He probably, his execution probably wasn't that brilliant.
[00:52:09] Gerard Donnelly: What date was that?
[00:52:10] Gerard Donnelly: That was last Friday.
[00:52:14] Gerard Donnelly: So, so Marv hasn't put that into his spreadsheet.
[00:52:21] Gerard Donnelly: Okay, I'll text Marv.
[00:52:24] Gerard Donnelly: And Abby, don't forget to put your Macmillan data in there as well.
[00:52:31] Gerard Donnelly: In the spreadsheet.
[00:52:32] Gerard Donnelly: In the spreadsheet, okay.
[00:52:34] Gerard Donnelly: Yeah, you know, go into Macmillan and find out what his 5k, 10k half marathon paces are, and then what his steady state tempo, tempo intervals.
[00:52:45] Gerard Donnelly: You following what I'm saying there?
[00:52:48] Gerard Donnelly: Yeah.
[00:52:49] Abby Jorgensen: Yeah.
[00:52:51] Gerard Donnelly: So just have that in his spreadsheet so that you can refer to it.
[00:52:58] Gerard Donnelly: Yeah.
[00:52:59] Gerard Donnelly: Yeah.
[00:53:00] Gerard Donnelly: Yeah.
[00:53:01] Gerard Donnelly: So his execution was probably a little bit too quick, but that 5.14 pace, and then 5.15, yeah, I wouldn't be criticising that, that's fine.
[00:53:17] Gerard Donnelly: It's absolutely brilliant, really good.
[00:53:21] Gerard Donnelly: Erin?
[00:53:22] Abby Jorgensen: She's still carrying the country right now.
[00:53:27] Abby Jorgensen: Yeah, okay.
[00:53:29] Gerard Donnelly: But, I mean, yeah.
[00:53:31] Abby Jorgensen: She's trying to do something?
[00:53:33] Abby Jorgensen: She's trying to do something, but, like, where she's at, so, like, Yellowstone and those areas, it's, they're just, I mean, I'm kind of jealous, love that area.
[00:53:45] Abby Jorgensen: She keeps posting stuff, and I'm like, wow, I haven't been there in forever.
[00:53:50] Abby Jorgensen: It's one of those things, you go as a kid, and you don't appreciate it as a kid, and then as an adult, you're like, wow.
[00:53:56] Abby Jorgensen: Yep.
[00:53:59] Gerard Donnelly: Good.
[00:54:01] Gerard Donnelly: Um, she wants to get back on track.
[00:54:07] Abby Jorgensen: She's feeling better, but this trip kind of fell right at a spot where.
[00:54:13] Abby Jorgensen: Yep.
[00:54:14] Gerard Donnelly: That's okay.
[00:54:14] Gerard Donnelly: All right.
[00:54:15] Abby Jorgensen: Riley.
[00:54:16] Abby Jorgensen: He's doing good.
[00:54:18] Abby Jorgensen: He's, uh, his ride on Saturday, he had a ride.
[00:54:24] Abby Jorgensen: Um, and I kind of put in some, some ranges for him and he seemed to, he's a lot better at staying.
[00:54:32] Abby Jorgensen: Kind of in the ranges.
[00:54:34] Abby Jorgensen: Yep.
[00:54:35] Gerard Donnelly: And he seems to stop pedaling a lot, doesn't he?
[00:54:38] Abby Jorgensen: Yeah.
[00:54:39] Abby Jorgensen: I don't know if he's doing, if he's on his, I think he's on his gravel bike and there's like hills and stuff.
[00:54:43] Abby Jorgensen: So I don't know.
[00:54:44] Abby Jorgensen: Yep.
[00:54:47] Abby Jorgensen: Oh, yeah.
[00:54:51] Abby Jorgensen: Cause he has one other gravel race he's doing here in November or mountain bike.
[00:55:01] Abby Jorgensen: don't know what the difference.
[00:55:01] Abby Jorgensen: Yep.
[00:55:04] Gerard Donnelly: Mountain bike is really more technical, like, narrow track, whereas mountain bikes should be long, long trail, up and down, not technical.
[00:55:25] Abby Jorgensen: You mean gravel versus mountain?
[00:55:27] Abby Jorgensen: Yeah, gravel versus mountain.
[00:55:29] Gerard Donnelly: Gravel should be on, not technical stuff, should be on, you know, farm track roads, whereas mountain bike could be in the bush where it's just so technical where you try to.
[00:55:44] Abby Jorgensen: Yeah, I mean, I watched, when I lived out in Colorado, I had friends that did that, and I was like, I'd kill myself doing that.
[00:55:50] Abby Jorgensen: Yeah, it's very dangerous.
[00:55:51] Gerard Donnelly: Yep.
[00:55:54] Gerard Donnelly: All right, so you think he's going all right?
[00:55:56] Abby Jorgensen: Yeah, he's, I mean, he hits pretty much all his sessions.
[00:56:00] Abby Jorgensen: Yep.
[00:56:01] Abby Jorgensen: The only time he...
[00:56:01] Abby Jorgensen: He didn't was when he was sick, but, yeah.
[00:56:07] Gerard Donnelly: Good.
[00:56:08] Gerard Donnelly: And testing-wise for him, is he 250?
[00:56:13] Gerard Donnelly: No, he just tested, didn't he?
[00:56:17] Gerard Donnelly: Yeah.
[00:56:20] Gerard Donnelly: That's 40, 50 watts since he started in July.
[00:56:23] Gerard Donnelly: Oh, my God, Abby.
[00:56:25] Abby Jorgensen: Yeah, he's, like, you know, a bigger guy, so I think initially he didn't know.
[00:56:29] Abby Jorgensen: tested low.
[00:56:30] Abby Jorgensen: Yeah.
[00:56:30] Abby Jorgensen: He's capable of.
[00:56:33] Abby Jorgensen: What about Al?
[00:56:36] Abby Jorgensen: Peter.
[00:56:38] Abby Jorgensen: He didn't have, last week was a little hard because the weather was crappy, but all of his stuff from California hadn't arrived yet, so he didn't have his Wahoo.
[00:56:49] Abby Jorgensen: Yeah.
[00:56:49] Abby Jorgensen: So he had to, like, go to the Y and just find a spin bike to ride.
[00:56:55] Abby Jorgensen: Yeah, okay.
[00:56:55] Abby Jorgensen: But his session this weekend went really well.
[00:56:59] Abby Jorgensen: Well, he said he felt really, really good.
[00:57:01] Abby Jorgensen: Good headwind on the way back, or one of the.
[00:57:13] Gerard Donnelly: Yeah, it was a headwind back.
[00:57:18] Gerard Donnelly: I would say great session, fantastic, really good writing.
[00:57:23] Gerard Donnelly: That's everything we want.
[00:57:25] Gerard Donnelly: I'd get him maybe to do 30 minutes out, 30 minutes back, 30 minutes out, 30 minutes back.
[00:57:31] Gerard Donnelly: Okay.
[00:57:32] Abby Jorgensen: He's just doing an hour in one direction.
[00:57:38] Gerard Donnelly: No, no, that one wasn't.
[00:57:40] Gerard Donnelly: It looked weird when I looked at it too.
[00:57:42] Abby Jorgensen: was like, what are doing?
[00:57:44] Abby Jorgensen: The second one is one direction.
[00:57:46] Gerard Donnelly: This one's not.
[00:57:48] Abby Jorgensen: Maybe he just had to get back.
[00:57:50] Abby Jorgensen: I don't know.
[00:57:55] Abby Jorgensen: It's a new area for him too, so I'm sure.
[00:57:57] Abby Jorgensen: He's just probably, I wouldn't be too critical.
[00:57:59] Gerard Donnelly: I'd just say, well, no, that's great.
[00:58:01] Gerard Donnelly: Yeah.
[00:58:01] Abby Jorgensen: I him right after I got it, and then his run, he said he did his last, the last mile was like uphill, or the last, I was like, it still looks pretty good.
[00:58:17] Gerard Donnelly: He's trying it well, he's, what's his event?
[00:58:21] Abby Jorgensen: Marbeo.
[00:58:22] Abby Jorgensen: Marbeo, yeah, okay.
[00:58:23] Gerard Donnelly: Okay, so we, we, it's really hilly, you know Marbeo's really hilly.
[00:58:33] Gerard Donnelly: So we've got to get him, we've got to get him, like how much elevation is he doing here?
[00:58:47] Gerard Donnelly: It doesn't show elevation, I wonder why.
[00:58:50] Abby Jorgensen: I think his week before, you go to his weekend before, his first, he says it's pretty hilly out there, not as hilly as California, but.
[00:58:59] Gerard Donnelly: It's not showing elevation, is it?
[00:59:02] Abby Jorgensen: I don't know, sometimes this Garmin is weird and doesn't.
[00:59:06] Abby Jorgensen: It's like, like Marbella is 2,000 metres, so.
[00:59:10] Abby Jorgensen: It's like 7,000 feet, right?
[00:59:12] Abby Jorgensen: 6,000.
[00:59:13] Gerard Donnelly: Yeah, so maybe the next few weeks, get him to do these sessions where you're asking him to ride as hilly a course as he can possibly find, okay?
[00:59:27] Abby Jorgensen: Okay.
[00:59:27] Gerard Donnelly: So that's your next thing, because you don't want him to get there and go, oh, I didn't realise it was this hilly, you know?
[00:59:34] Abby Jorgensen: Yeah, he looked it up together, he knows it.
[00:59:36] Gerard Donnelly: Yeah, so tell him, we're trying to replicate what's going on on race day.
[00:59:45] Gerard Donnelly: That would be the only thing I'd say to him, you know?
[00:59:47] Gerard Donnelly: He's training really well for a flat course.
[00:59:51] Gerard Donnelly: That's what he's, these race ready sessions, he's doing perfectly.
[00:59:54] Gerard Donnelly: But for Marbella, he needs to be going up or down and learning how to ride.
[01:00:01] Gerard Donnelly: moment.
[01:00:01] Gerard Donnelly: game.
[01:00:01] Gerard Donnelly: 20-minute, 30-minute climb, you know, in the ranges, and then recover, and then, because it's, the course is like this.
[01:00:12] Gerard Donnelly: So, yeah, okay.
[01:00:14] Abby Jorgensen: Wisconsin.
[01:00:16] Abby Jorgensen: Kristen.
[01:00:17] Abby Jorgensen: I'm struggling with her because she doesn't respond to me, doesn't do the sessions I put in for her, so I don't know what to do, because she won't respond to me.
[01:00:29] Gerard Donnelly: Yeah.
[01:00:30] Gerard Donnelly: And everything I put in, she just does her own thing.
[01:00:33] Abby Jorgensen: Right.
[01:00:36] Gerard Donnelly: Well, we need to just stop her doing the program, do you think?
[01:00:44] Abby Jorgensen: Yeah, mean, she claimed, like, a while ago when she did text me when she got back from Japan, she's like, I want to get back on a schedule, but then the next text I sent and the next, like, communication, then she never responded.
[01:00:58] Abby Jorgensen: And I was like, hey, let's get a call so that we can figure this out.
[01:01:01] Abby Jorgensen: call so And get
[01:01:01] Abby Jorgensen: And then did again the next, like I waited a week and then I never heard back again.
[01:01:07] Abby Jorgensen: And so I was like, it's like, doesn't want structure.
[01:01:11] Abby Jorgensen: She just wants to do, she doesn't do these.
[01:01:15] Abby Jorgensen: I put them in and then it's just whatever she's doing.
[01:01:18] Abby Jorgensen: I don't know.
[01:01:19] Abby Jorgensen: She's just writing.
[01:01:23] Abby Jorgensen: I thought if I put something in and she would see it and she would follow it, but no, she's just kind of, what else to do?
[01:01:32] Abby Jorgensen: Yep.
[01:01:33] Gerard Donnelly: Just reach out to her saying, hey, Kristen, start of another week.
[01:01:39] Gerard Donnelly: None of the sessions that I put in you did last week.
[01:01:43] Gerard Donnelly: I don't know what to put in.
[01:01:45] Gerard Donnelly: Just say exactly that.
[01:01:45] Gerard Donnelly: I don't know what to put in.
[01:01:51] Gerard Donnelly: I'm here.
[01:01:52] Gerard Donnelly: I'm just finished.
[01:01:53] Gerard Donnelly: I'm here to help you in any way you want.
[01:01:56] Gerard Donnelly: You just need to let me know how you want to be coached.
[01:02:03] Gerard Donnelly: Okay?
[01:02:04] Gerard Donnelly: Yeah.
[01:02:05] Gerard Donnelly: You can't do much more than that.
[01:02:06] Gerard Donnelly: And don't put any sessions in Abby until she responds.
[01:02:10] Gerard Donnelly: Okay.
[01:02:10] Gerard Donnelly: And just say in that text, say, I don't know what to give you because everything I'm giving you doesn't seem like you're doing.
[01:02:18] Gerard Donnelly: So I'll wait for you to tell me what sort of program you want.
[01:02:26] Gerard Donnelly: Okay, so make it really clear.
[01:02:28] Gerard Donnelly: And maybe it's an email.
[01:02:29] Gerard Donnelly: Maybe it's a text.
[01:02:30] Gerard Donnelly: I don't know.
[01:02:31] Gerard Donnelly: Or a voice message.
[01:02:33] Gerard Donnelly: Just leave a voice message with your tone, you know, really kind tone of, you know, hey, Kristen, really, really want to find out if we can help you.
[01:02:45] Gerard Donnelly: You know, that sort of, you know, I don't want to give you any sessions anymore because last week I gave them to you and it didn't look like you did any of them.
[01:02:55] Gerard Donnelly: So I'm a little bit confused.
[01:02:57] Gerard Donnelly: Can you, can you reach back out to me, please?
[01:02:59] Gerard Donnelly: .
[01:02:59] Gerard Donnelly: .
[01:03:00] Gerard Donnelly: .
[01:03:00] Gerard Donnelly: .
[01:03:00] Gerard Donnelly: You
[01:03:02] Gerard Donnelly: You can't do much more than that.
[01:03:03] Gerard Donnelly: And if she doesn't, I think we just have to.
[01:03:06] Gerard Donnelly: I'm not in the business of taking money.
[01:03:09] Abby Jorgensen: Yeah, that's what I don't understand.
[01:03:10] Abby Jorgensen: I'm like, you're paying for this.
[01:03:12] Abby Jorgensen: I'm trying to help you.
[01:03:13] Gerard Donnelly: But I don't want to give athletes away, but anyway, Dan, happy with Dan?
[01:03:23] Abby Jorgensen: Yeah, he's he's been pretty, pretty happy with how he's doing and the program.
[01:03:28] Abby Jorgensen: We've had to adjust a little bit with some family things.
[01:03:31] Abby Jorgensen: But and then he got well, actually, don't.
[01:03:35] Abby Jorgensen: He was supposed to get furloughed with this stupid government shutdown, but then like he's essential.
[01:03:40] Abby Jorgensen: So he's like, so I get to work, not get paid.
[01:03:45] Abby Jorgensen: I don't know.
[01:03:47] Abby Jorgensen: Being in America right now is not great.
[01:03:49] Abby Jorgensen: So if, yeah, yeah.
[01:03:53] Abby Jorgensen: So so, yeah, we moved his long run to Wednesday because the weekends, I think is basically it sounded like his wife was.
[01:04:00] Abby Jorgensen: Yes.
[01:04:02] Abby Jorgensen: Not on board with a Sunday, doing too much on a Sunday.
[01:04:08] Abby Jorgensen: So, yeah, but it's working.
[01:04:11] Gerard Donnelly: Yeah.
[01:04:18] Abby Jorgensen: But his race, he had a Saturday, last Saturday was, or this Saturday was a really good session.
[01:04:26] Gerard Donnelly: Yeah.
[01:04:37] Gerard Donnelly: That's fantastic.
[01:04:38] Gerard Donnelly: Geez.
[01:04:40] Gerard Donnelly: Yeah.
[01:04:40] Abby Jorgensen: He said there's a couple of bumpy roads, so he had to, some of it's all over the place, but, because he said he lost his taillight, lost a bottle on the road, but he finally found a smooth road.
[01:04:55] Abby Jorgensen: Yeah.
[01:04:58] Gerard Donnelly: I'm just a bit worried that he's got.
[01:05:02] Gerard Donnelly: He's got a hard day, long run, hard day, intervals, yeah.
[01:05:09] Gerard Donnelly: It's interesting, Abby, like if he does that, the session you've got on Sunday, that's actually more time than the long run.
[01:05:19] Gerard Donnelly: I can't remember why.
[01:05:22] Abby Jorgensen: Do you know what mean?
[01:05:23] Gerard Donnelly: Yeah, I told him he could have one or the other.
[01:05:27] Abby Jorgensen: Yeah, but it's only like 20 minutes difference between doing that.
[01:05:33] Gerard Donnelly: And doing that.
[01:05:35] Gerard Donnelly: Yeah, I don't know if it's him being out of the house.
[01:05:38] Abby Jorgensen: I don't know.
[01:05:39] Abby Jorgensen: Because he was like, I need my Sunday run to be an hour.
[01:05:44] Abby Jorgensen: And I was like, well, we need at least get you to an hour and 40 because of your volume.
[01:05:58] Gerard Donnelly: No, I think you've done a good compromise.
[01:06:00] Gerard Donnelly: I don't know how else I could do it either.
[01:06:02] Gerard Donnelly: I'm a little bit baffled.
[01:06:05] Gerard Donnelly: Yeah, I think he was frustrated too, but...
[01:06:08] Abby Jorgensen: Yeah.
[01:06:14] Gerard Donnelly: I think it's a good effort, Abby, what you've done, actually.
[01:06:22] Gerard Donnelly: Yeah.
[01:06:23] Gerard Donnelly: He doesn't seem...
[01:06:24] Abby Jorgensen: Last week, it didn't seem to affect his Tuesday, Thursday rides too much, so...
[01:06:29] Abby Jorgensen: Yeah.
[01:06:31] Gerard Donnelly: Let's see how it goes.
[01:06:32] Gerard Donnelly: Yeah.
[01:06:33] Gerard Donnelly: We'll monitor that one.
[01:06:35] Gerard Donnelly: We'll go to Bill.
[01:06:37] Gerard Donnelly: Yeah, he's just in Ironman recovery.
[01:06:41] Abby Jorgensen: Yeah.
[01:06:42] Gerard Donnelly: He was happy.
[01:06:44] Gerard Donnelly: We did talk about that, didn't we?
[01:06:45] Gerard Donnelly: Yeah, he's...
[01:06:47] Abby Jorgensen: And then he picked a gravel race here in November.
[01:06:51] Abby Jorgensen: He wants to just keep it something fun, something to keep him.
[01:06:56] Abby Jorgensen: But he's...
[01:06:58] Abby Jorgensen: I talked with him, was it Thursday?
[01:07:00] Abby Jorgensen: Yeah, Thursday, and...
[01:07:01] Abby Jorgensen: Yeah.
[01:07:02] Abby Jorgensen: And, yeah, he's, mean, we're going this week and then next week maybe a little bit more, you know, like zone two, maybe some zone three.
[01:07:11] Abby Jorgensen: And then he said he'd be kind of ready to kind of jump back in.
[01:07:16] Gerard Donnelly: Yeah, just don't be too, you just got to keep saying to him, look, you know, believe me, you need to take this time to make it easy.
[01:07:27] Gerard Donnelly: Because once you start getting back into it again, you feel like you didn't take enough time during that, you know, like I've really forced you to ease up.
[01:07:36] Gerard Donnelly: And even though you're still doing, you know, some strength and conditioning stuff, which was had intensity in it, but we really didn't push you for anything.
[01:07:48] Gerard Donnelly: And I think you've reaped the benefits.
[01:07:51] Gerard Donnelly: Yeah.
[01:07:53] Gerard Donnelly: Yeah.
[01:07:53] Gerard Donnelly: All right.
[01:07:57] Gerard Donnelly: Nancy, help with the RISE plan?
[01:08:02] Abby Jorgensen: Yeah, I have, I think, for bike power, I think somewhere between, like, looking at all of her race-ready sessions and then her FTP outdoor that she just did, which is weird.
[01:08:24] Abby Jorgensen: Like, her power was low, but that was the highest speed she's ever done.
[01:08:30] Abby Jorgensen: That would be fantastic.
[01:08:31] Abby Jorgensen: Wow, she was happy with that, but she's like, I don't know why, like, my power, I mean, her power is just not super high to begin with.
[01:08:39] Abby Jorgensen: But all of her, like, race-ready are right around that 105, 95 to 105, 107 range.
[01:08:49] Abby Jorgensen: Yes, they are, aren't they?
[01:08:53] Abby Jorgensen: So I don't know how big of a range to give her, 90 to 105, 90 to 110, 95 to 110.
[01:09:01] Gerard Donnelly: That's Yeah.
[01:09:02] Gerard Donnelly: Oh, what?
[01:09:03] Gerard Donnelly: Oh, she's in Kona.
[01:09:06] Gerard Donnelly: She did this in Kona, right?
[01:09:07] Abby Jorgensen: Yeah.
[01:09:09] Abby Jorgensen: That's why I was like, well, it's as accurate as we can get being in Kona.
[01:09:21] Gerard Donnelly: I'm just trying to see why is she?
[01:09:28] Gerard Donnelly: I mean, she started at the airport.
[01:09:31] Gerard Donnelly: That's fine.
[01:09:33] Gerard Donnelly: But what is with, she stopped pedaling altogether.
[01:09:40] Gerard Donnelly: Are those hills?
[01:09:41] Gerard Donnelly: Yeah, they're hills, but they're not, honestly, they're not hills.
[01:09:46] Gerard Donnelly: They're, if you look down the road, it looks like that, but there's no way you're going downhill.
[01:09:54] Gerard Donnelly: And then on the way back, do you know what mean?
[01:09:59] Gerard Donnelly: She's on the same course.
[01:10:15] Abby Jorgensen: She struggled with that the last time she was out in Kona, with keeping pressure on the pedals.
[01:10:24] Gerard Donnelly: But this doesn't even add up.
[01:10:27] Gerard Donnelly: Look at that, compared to that.
[01:10:28] Abby Jorgensen: I know.
[01:10:29] Abby Jorgensen: That's what I don't know.
[01:10:30] Abby Jorgensen: She just finally figured it out.
[01:10:32] Abby Jorgensen: I don't know.
[01:10:34] Gerard Donnelly: Hmm.
[01:10:36] Gerard Donnelly: So what did she end up with?
[01:10:39] Gerard Donnelly: 121.
[01:10:43] Gerard Donnelly: But what did she end up in the last bit?
[01:10:46] Gerard Donnelly: 135, I think.
[01:10:47] Abby Jorgensen: That's more accurate, isn't it?
[01:10:49] Gerard Donnelly: 136.
[01:10:51] Abby Jorgensen: Which is more in line with some of her last tests.
[01:10:56] Abby Jorgensen: Yep.
[01:11:01] Gerard Donnelly: She's in...
[01:11:02] Gerard Donnelly: in...
[01:11:02] Gerard Donnelly: That hasn't been put in the spreadsheet, either.
[01:11:04] Gerard Donnelly: I think she just did it.
[01:11:06] Abby Jorgensen: Yes, okay.
[01:11:07] Abby Jorgensen: Ready?
[01:11:12] Gerard Donnelly: So going by her spreadsheet from September, she did 105 to 111, 180K.
[01:11:20] Gerard Donnelly: And then the week before, she did 107 to 112.
[01:11:24] Gerard Donnelly: And she did 103 to 109 the week before that.
[01:11:29] Gerard Donnelly: Yeah, so I think that's right, Abby.
[01:11:32] Gerard Donnelly: I would be saying to her, her range is really between 90 and 120.
[01:11:43] Gerard Donnelly: But I would be giving her a bit more of a range, so 130.
[01:11:47] Gerard Donnelly: Give her a 40-watt range, 190 to 130.
[01:11:53] Gerard Donnelly: So if there's any bits where it's a little bit harder, she can – her whole goal should just be to be as comfortable.
[01:12:03] Abby Jorgensen: Yeah, she wants a good run, so she has to, she did, like, I think, what did she send me?
[01:12:17] Abby Jorgensen: She thinks it'll take her 650 to seven hours for the full bike, which is probably about right.
[01:12:30] Gerard Donnelly: Yep, that's right.
[01:12:34] Gerard Donnelly: What did you have for your plan for her?
[01:12:38] Abby Jorgensen: I had 90 to, like, 115, just based off of her rides.
[01:12:45] Abby Jorgensen: I just didn't know how big of a range to give her.
[01:12:48] Gerard Donnelly: Yeah, I'd say bump that to 120, so if, you know, is she a stickler for, if you say 115, she won't go above it, or she's just all over the place?
[01:13:00] Gerard Donnelly: She's kind of all over the place.
[01:13:01] Abby Jorgensen: I mean, she tries.
[01:13:02] Abby Jorgensen: Yeah.
[01:13:02] Abby Jorgensen: you.
[01:13:02] Abby Jorgensen: It's like, she tries really hard, but.
[01:13:05] Gerard Donnelly: Yeah, I'd bump that from 90 to 120 and just say, listen, Nancy, just stay in there.
[01:13:12] Gerard Donnelly: Just, you know, just have your three-second power on your screen.
[01:13:17] Gerard Donnelly: And if you want to be pushing lap at any point, feel free to do so.
[01:13:22] Gerard Donnelly: Yeah, if give her too much to concentrate on, it makes it worse with her, I think.
[01:13:27] Abby Jorgensen: I don't know why.
[01:13:28] Gerard Donnelly: Just three-second power or instant power and the lap average power.
[01:13:35] Gerard Donnelly: That's all she needs to worry about.
[01:13:37] Gerard Donnelly: Cadence and heart rate.
[01:13:39] Gerard Donnelly: They're the things you should have on a screen.
[01:13:44] Abby Jorgensen: Fun, I have starting at about a 12.30 mile pace and progressing to, you know, eventually, like, seems like in her long run she can – push to 11.30 pace.
[01:14:01] Abby Jorgensen: Okay.
[01:14:02] Abby Jorgensen: She likes to use power, too, but so 150 to 165 power for her runs.
[01:14:10] Gerard Donnelly: Yeah, whatever pace you think, tell her that we're not trying to run faster through this.
[01:14:16] Gerard Donnelly: just, the heart rate will be way higher because it's so hot out.
[01:14:19] Gerard Donnelly: The energy lab where they go out and back, it's like an oven out there, Abby.
[01:14:25] Gerard Donnelly: And she's been there.
[01:14:26] Gerard Donnelly: She knows it.
[01:14:28] Abby Jorgensen: And they just had a volcano erupt, it looked like.
[01:14:31] Abby Jorgensen: She sent me a video of something.
[01:14:33] Abby Jorgensen: I don't know.
[01:14:34] Abby Jorgensen: Right.
[01:14:35] Gerard Donnelly: I would just be saying to her, just be conservative.
[01:14:38] Gerard Donnelly: Just, please, just do the whole race with discipline.
[01:14:41] Gerard Donnelly: And then, you know, if you're feeling okay, then run whatever you like.
[01:14:45] Gerard Donnelly: But the first, you know, 12 to 15 miles should be just conservative running.
[01:14:54] Gerard Donnelly: And don't be fixated on, you know, 12, 32-minute mile pace.
[01:15:02] Gerard Donnelly: if you're hoping do And
[01:15:02] Gerard Donnelly: And to 12, 28, just forget about that.
[01:15:04] Gerard Donnelly: Just be comfortable and keep yourself cool.
[01:15:09] Gerard Donnelly: And, yeah, so take away that pressure of pacing.
[01:15:15] Gerard Donnelly: Just, you know, how I did with you is like, you know, just start comfortably.
[01:15:19] Gerard Donnelly: No pressure.
[01:15:20] Gerard Donnelly: We don't want you to run fast, early.
[01:15:24] Gerard Donnelly: And that just gave you freedom just to run the run you wanted.
[01:15:32] Gerard Donnelly: And so, yeah, I think it's more just telling her she's trained really well.
[01:15:39] Gerard Donnelly: She's done all the work.
[01:15:40] Gerard Donnelly: Just stay disciplined in the ranges on the bike.
[01:15:44] Gerard Donnelly: And then, you know, just take your time on the run.
[01:15:48] Gerard Donnelly: Here's your guide, but, you know, just be super conservative early.
[01:15:53] Gerard Donnelly: It's just going to get harder.
[01:15:54] Gerard Donnelly: It's going to get harder and harder as you go through the heat out the back.
[01:15:59] Gerard Donnelly: It's not like any other race.
[01:16:00] Gerard Donnelly: So whatever you've experienced.
[01:16:02] Gerard Donnelly: Experienced in any other race, you know, you've got to add literally 30 minutes to this race, 30 to 50 minutes.
[01:16:08] Gerard Donnelly: But we're not worried about the time.
[01:16:10] Gerard Donnelly: It's just do your best job.
[01:16:12] Gerard Donnelly: Yeah.
[01:16:13] Abby Jorgensen: I think, yeah, just make it as simple as you can.
[01:16:16] Gerard Donnelly: Just don't overcomplicate it.
[01:16:17] Gerard Donnelly: I think that's the attitude with her.
[01:16:20] Abby Jorgensen: Yeah.
[01:16:21] Abby Jorgensen: I think she has this attitude with now, too, with the new qualifying roles that this could be her last time in Kona.
[01:16:29] Abby Jorgensen: And then I was like, then enjoy it.
[01:16:32] Abby Jorgensen: Like, soak it in.
[01:16:35] Abby Jorgensen: She's putting the wrong pressure on herself, you know.
[01:16:37] Gerard Donnelly: It's all about other people, qualifying times.
[01:16:41] Gerard Donnelly: You know, they're the wrong things to be thinking about, you know.
[01:16:45] Gerard Donnelly: Be in the moment of, hey, I'm in Kona.
[01:16:48] Gerard Donnelly: I might not be here ever again, so I'm here now.
[01:16:52] Gerard Donnelly: Just, you know, have a great day.
[01:16:55] Gerard Donnelly: Yeah.
[01:16:56] Abby Jorgensen: Enjoy it.
[01:16:57] Abby Jorgensen: Yeah.
[01:16:57] Abby Jorgensen: I would kill to be there.
[01:16:59] Abby Jorgensen: Yeah.
[01:16:59] Abby Jorgensen: Yeah.
[01:17:00] Abby Jorgensen: Or just actually.
[01:17:02] Abby Jorgensen: Go to Hawaii once in my life.
[01:17:07] Gerard Donnelly: Anything else on anybody?
[01:17:09] Gerard Donnelly: No, I think that that's pretty much it.
[01:17:12] Abby Jorgensen: It's been a good week.
[01:17:14] Abby Jorgensen: Yeah.
[01:17:15] Abby Jorgensen: I think, yeah, with my hours changing next week, too, I just felt like the last couple weeks, too, like I try to cram in everything, and I don't like that from a coaching perspective.
[01:17:30] Abby Jorgensen: Yeah, definitely.
[01:17:31] Abby Jorgensen: Yeah.
[01:17:31] Abby Jorgensen: Yeah.
[01:17:34] Gerard Donnelly: John DaCosta, have you had any information back from him?
[01:17:39] Abby Jorgensen: Floydon sent me the athlete profile, and that's it.
[01:17:42] Abby Jorgensen: Yeah, he doesn't have any equipment, so.
[01:17:44] Gerard Donnelly: Okay.
[01:17:45] Abby Jorgensen: Well, it was weird because I thought it said that, but then it said he had a power meter, so I was confused.
[01:17:51] Abby Jorgensen: Yeah, I think he was, I told him he just had to go and buy everything, so.
[01:17:56] Gerard Donnelly: Did you watch the video?
[01:17:57] Gerard Donnelly: Can you remember?
[01:17:58] Abby Jorgensen: He never sent that yet, or she never sent that.
[01:18:00] Abby Jorgensen: Well, can you reach out to Floyd and say.
[01:18:02] Gerard Donnelly: Yeah.
[01:18:03] Gerard Donnelly: The phone call or the whatever?
[01:18:06] Abby Jorgensen: Yeah, the coaching interview.
[01:18:09] Gerard Donnelly: Okay.
[01:18:10] Abby Jorgensen: He's a young kid, right?
[01:18:12] Gerard Donnelly: No, no, he's a big guy.
[01:18:18] Abby Jorgensen: Yeah, he's young.
[01:18:20] Gerard Donnelly: That's true.
[01:18:22] Abby Jorgensen: I mean, 25 seems young to me.
[01:18:24] Abby Jorgensen: Yeah, it is true.
[01:18:29] Gerard Donnelly: Yeah, he's the only one we need to...
[01:18:34] Gerard Donnelly: get moving.
[01:18:37] Abby Jorgensen: He's from Massachusetts.
[01:18:41] Abby Jorgensen: That's right, Austin.
[01:18:42] Gerard Donnelly: So I'm just reading the summary notes.
[01:18:45] Gerard Donnelly: He needs a TT bike or a road bike.
[01:18:47] Gerard Donnelly: He doesn't have a bike.
[01:18:48] Gerard Donnelly: That was my first thing.
[01:18:50] Gerard Donnelly: What bike?
[01:18:50] Gerard Donnelly: He needs a power meter.
[01:18:52] Gerard Donnelly: I said to him, Garmin or Asiomo.
[01:18:54] Gerard Donnelly: He needs a bike computer.
[01:18:55] Gerard Donnelly: He needs cycling shoes with cleats.
[01:18:56] Gerard Donnelly: He needs a wahoo kicker.
[01:18:58] Gerard Donnelly: He was going to get a secondhand one.
[01:18:59] Gerard Donnelly: So that was his first job.
[01:19:01] Gerard Donnelly: Um...
[01:19:01] Gerard Donnelly: Makes it wall.
[01:19:02] Gerard Donnelly: so
[01:19:02] Gerard Donnelly: I just, mine just arrived today.
[01:19:04] Abby Jorgensen: I have to figure out how to put it together.
[01:19:07] Abby Jorgensen: The Wahoo, the Kicker Core 1 is on sale for $3.99.
[01:19:12] Abby Jorgensen: Oh, okay.
[01:19:13] Abby Jorgensen: Good.
[01:19:14] Abby Jorgensen: So, yeah, I got that.
[01:19:15] Abby Jorgensen: So we'll see.
[01:19:16] Abby Jorgensen: Hopefully it, Andrew says the Kicker Cores are, I mean, like, it's so much better than the wheel-on ones.
[01:19:23] Abby Jorgensen: So we'll see.
[01:19:25] Abby Jorgensen: Yes.
[01:19:26] Abby Jorgensen: Yeah, that'd be great.
[01:19:31] Abby Jorgensen: My goal is to have it set up by Wednesday.
[01:19:33] Abby Jorgensen: I'll probably do have to do that indoor climb again because of the weather and everything.
[01:19:37] Abby Jorgensen: okay.
[01:19:38] Abby Jorgensen: Yeah, that's fine.
[01:19:39] Abby Jorgensen: Yeah.
[01:19:40] Abby Jorgensen: Yeah.
[01:19:40] Abby Jorgensen: There's just the climb on the wheel-on ones.
[01:19:44] Abby Jorgensen: I know it's probably been a while since you've used those, but sometimes it doesn't respond as quickly.
[01:19:49] Abby Jorgensen: Yeah.
[01:19:52] Gerard Donnelly: It's a great climb, the Optus Rift.
[01:19:54] Gerard Donnelly: Yeah, I like that.
[01:19:57] Gerard Donnelly: I think I've done it over 120 times.
[01:20:00] Gerard Donnelly: The first few times I did it, was like...
[01:20:02] Abby Jorgensen: This is never-ending, but now I kind of know what it is.
[01:20:07] Abby Jorgensen: And it tells you your PB for each sector?
[01:20:10] Gerard Donnelly: Yeah.
[01:20:13] Gerard Donnelly: Yeah.
[01:20:17] Gerard Donnelly: All right, well, maybe reach out to John on Floyd and send you the video.
[01:20:26] Abby Jorgensen: Okay.
[01:20:27] Gerard Donnelly: And just with a WhatsApp message saying how the purchase is going.
[01:20:34] Gerard Donnelly: Okay.
[01:20:37] Abby Jorgensen: I'll do the same.
[01:20:41] Abby Jorgensen: Okay?
[01:20:42] Abby Jorgensen: Yep.
[01:20:46] Abby Jorgensen: And then he, I mean, as soon as he does that, then he can get his training peaks up and running.
[01:20:52] Abby Jorgensen: Yep.
[01:20:56] Gerard Donnelly: Yep.
[01:20:58] Gerard Donnelly: All right, watch that video anyway.
[01:20:59] Gerard Donnelly: You get a good idea.
[01:21:01] Gerard Donnelly: Yeah, I love watching.
[01:21:06] Gerard Donnelly: So I talked about you and I said we can't start until you get the equipment, so but I need to check with Floyd and whether he's actually paid the first week because I told him he needed to pay week one and then we paused his program until he's ready.
[01:21:34] Gerard Donnelly: Okay, okay, I'll reach out.
[01:21:39] Abby Jorgensen: Have a good week.
[01:21:40] Abby Jorgensen: Yep, thank you, you too.
[01:21:41] Abby Jorgensen: Bye.
