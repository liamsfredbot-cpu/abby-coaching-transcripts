[00:00:00] Gerard Donnelly: Afternoon.
[00:00:01] Gerard Donnelly: Good morning.
[00:00:03] Gerard Donnelly: How are you doing?
[00:00:04] Gerard Donnelly: I had a rough morning.
[00:00:08] Abby Jorgensen: Oh, everything all right?
[00:00:09] Abby Jorgensen: Yeah, I had to break up a dogfight and I ended up with four stitches in my arm.
[00:00:15] Abby Jorgensen: Oh, Abby.
[00:00:17] Abby Jorgensen: Yeah, so I couldn't swim today.
[00:00:19] Abby Jorgensen: And were you outside with other dogs?
[00:00:23] Gerard Donnelly: They were inside.
[00:00:25] Abby Jorgensen: They fight over food.
[00:00:27] Abby Jorgensen: So there was an empty bowl.
[00:00:30] Abby Jorgensen: And one of the dogs went to go look in the bowl and then the other dog didn't like it.
[00:00:33] Abby Jorgensen: So I had to jump in and his, his tooth caught me like right, right in the arm here.
[00:00:39] Abby Jorgensen: So, so yeah, it's like four stitches.
[00:00:44] Abby Jorgensen: Oh, geez.
[00:00:46] Gerard Donnelly: Yeah.
[00:00:47] Gerard Donnelly: Is that, did, was it accidentally or did take a bite at you?
[00:00:53] Gerard Donnelly: It was accidental.
[00:00:54] Abby Jorgensen: Like, cause I, it was my 80 pound dog.
[00:00:57] Abby Jorgensen: So like I, I went to grab him and I think
[00:00:59] Abby Jorgensen: I his tooth got caught in my arm, and I didn't realize it at the time.
[00:01:04] Abby Jorgensen: I didn't even know what happened until after the whole thing ended, I had blood everywhere, so.
[00:01:11] Abby Jorgensen: Oh, Abby, oh my goodness.
[00:01:14] Abby Jorgensen: A little adrenaline this morning.
[00:01:16] Abby Jorgensen: I didn't really feel it, but now the pain's starting to come through a little bit right now.
[00:01:21] Gerard Donnelly: Have you got enough painkillers?
[00:01:25] Gerard Donnelly: They just gave me antibiotics, so I'll just take Is there a pain in that?
[00:01:31] Gerard Donnelly: No, they just told me to take ibuprofen.
[00:01:34] Gerard Donnelly: Yeah, you should.
[00:01:35] Gerard Donnelly: Yeah.
[00:01:39] Gerard Donnelly: Oh, that's so disappointing for you.
[00:01:42] Gerard Donnelly: Yeah, yeah.
[00:01:43] Abby Jorgensen: It wasn't how I wanted to start my Monday morning, that's for sure.
[00:01:46] Abby Jorgensen: No, yeah.
[00:01:49] Gerard Donnelly: You'll be a bit sore, so.
[00:01:51] Gerard Donnelly: Yeah.
[00:01:54] Gerard Donnelly: What do you do with the dogs?
[00:01:56] Gerard Donnelly: they realize what they're doing or not really?
[00:01:58] Gerard Donnelly: Not really.
[00:01:59] Gerard Donnelly: Thanks.
[00:02:00] Abby Jorgensen: They don't really understand what they did, but, you know, they acted like nothing happened after the fact, so.
[00:02:14] Gerard Donnelly: All right, well, did you go to work today?
[00:02:18] Abby Jorgensen: I went and coached noon class after.
[00:02:22] Abby Jorgensen: I was supposed to coach nine o'clock and it happened at like eight something, so.
[00:02:27] Abby Jorgensen: Yep.
[00:02:27] Abby Jorgensen: So I went to urgent care, actually in and out of there pretty quick, which is good for, for, for here, so.
[00:02:34] Abby Jorgensen: Yep.
[00:02:40] Gerard Donnelly: So, how, how are you feeling all day?
[00:02:43] Gerard Donnelly: You're feeling like you're not as well, or?
[00:02:47] Abby Jorgensen: Well, I mean, I feel fine right now.
[00:02:49] Abby Jorgensen: Just a little bit of the pain is starting to come through, but other than that, I felt decent.
[00:02:55] Abby Jorgensen: Hmm.
[00:02:57] Abby Jorgensen: Um, hey, fantastic run.
[00:02:59] Gerard Donnelly: Uh,
[00:03:01] Gerard Donnelly: That's really well done, Abby.
[00:03:02] Gerard Donnelly: What's the weather like at the moment?
[00:03:05] Gerard Donnelly: Is it able to go outside a bit more air?
[00:03:07] Abby Jorgensen: Yeah, I think today is 60 degrees.
[00:03:13] Abby Jorgensen: So, but this whole week looks in the 40s.
[00:03:16] Abby Jorgensen: So I'm hoping, you know, by the end of the week, especially this weekend, I should be able to get outside, not an issue.
[00:03:23] Gerard Donnelly: Yeah.
[00:03:23] Gerard Donnelly: What was it like on Saturday?
[00:03:27] Abby Jorgensen: Fairly cold to start with.
[00:03:28] Abby Jorgensen: So 25 Fahrenheit to start with.
[00:03:32] Abby Jorgensen: Was it wet?
[00:03:33] Abby Jorgensen: No, just cold.
[00:03:36] Abby Jorgensen: Much wind?
[00:03:41] Abby Jorgensen: I would say like a 10 or 13 mile an hour, like headwind, southeast wind.
[00:03:46] Abby Jorgensen: Yeah.
[00:03:47] Abby Jorgensen: So I felt it for sure on more on this, that long stretch.
[00:03:53] Abby Jorgensen: felt more on that stretch than anything.
[00:03:55] Gerard Donnelly: So that was a tower wind and then a headwind coming back.
[00:03:59] Gerard Donnelly: couple more fast.
[00:03:59] Gerard Donnelly: you.
[00:04:02] Gerard Donnelly: Headwind going out southeast so yeah so you've got you've got the wind coming from this direction yeah so headwind out a bit of a tailwind back yeah that's really good on your own that's that's your second best ever I didn't feel like the I got 10k in and I definitely started to feel yeah I mean when you're by yourself too you're just like struggling a little bit but that five minute k pace felt felt decent I mean I can hold that for quite a while yeah that's good to know and you know you're running 450 for your first section and you second you
[00:05:00] Gerard Donnelly: You slowed down a little bit, so that's probably too quick here, Abby, I think.
[00:05:09] Gerard Donnelly: In hindsight, is that what you think?
[00:05:11] Gerard Donnelly: Yeah, in hindsight.
[00:05:12] Gerard Donnelly: I mean, I felt great out of the gate.
[00:05:15] Gerard Donnelly: I haven't had a lot of sight in a while, so I was feeling pretty good.
[00:05:19] Gerard Donnelly: Yeah, well, you didn't fade that much, you know, but 10 seconds per K, it's a bit, it's not that much.
[00:05:29] Gerard Donnelly: But you'd certainly have more of an enjoyable experience doing it the other way around.
[00:05:34] Gerard Donnelly: But it's great that you're off the treadmill and you've got a chance to see what you could actually do outside again.
[00:05:41] Gerard Donnelly: You know, you're in marathon training, you're not trying to run 10K or half marathon.
[00:05:46] Gerard Donnelly: So, you know, and the thing, the thing about this is, if you're starting to feel a little bit crampy and, you know, that's, that's kind of because you're not outside much and you're on the treadmill.
[00:05:59] Gerard Donnelly: Oh, yeah.
[00:06:00] Gerard Donnelly: You know, it's a different environment, isn't it?
[00:06:04] Abby Jorgensen: Like my hamstrings and calves are still a little sore today.
[00:06:08] Abby Jorgensen: tender, yeah.
[00:06:09] Gerard Donnelly: Yeah, okay.
[00:06:11] Gerard Donnelly: If they're still sore tomorrow, that's why I've given you, they're still sore tomorrow, you know, you might be better off doing a ride, just an easy bike spin.
[00:06:24] Gerard Donnelly: So you've got to be a little bit careful about, yeah, pushing your legs when they're too sore.
[00:06:30] Gerard Donnelly: It might be better if you've got time to ride and then do a run easy, even if you rode for 20 minutes, 20, 30 minutes, just spin your legs out, get some blood flow, and then start walking into a jog.
[00:06:45] Gerard Donnelly: You know, we don't, it's just an easy run.
[00:06:47] Gerard Donnelly: So, but if your legs are too sore, then, yeah, just do the ride alone.
[00:06:54] Gerard Donnelly: Okay.
[00:06:57] Gerard Donnelly: What other things did you learn there?
[00:06:59] Gerard Donnelly: there?
[00:07:01] Abby Jorgensen: Um, I mean, I felt like my heart rate was fairly high the entire year, which I think like all week is, I mean, even in the FTP test, it was super high.
[00:07:13] Abby Jorgensen: So I don't know if that played a role in everything, but like, I was holding that 168 for, I think it said like 90 minutes, I had 168 or whatever.
[00:07:27] Abby Jorgensen: 169.
[00:07:28] Abby Jorgensen: Yeah, 168.
[00:07:29] Gerard Donnelly: That's right.
[00:07:30] Gerard Donnelly: Yep.
[00:07:32] Gerard Donnelly: That is high.
[00:07:33] Gerard Donnelly: And it doesn't look like it's reading.
[00:07:36] Gerard Donnelly: You know, that looks like a good reading to me.
[00:07:38] Gerard Donnelly: Yeah.
[00:07:39] Abby Jorgensen: I mean, it didn't feel like a normal 168, 170.
[00:07:45] Gerard Donnelly: Yeah.
[00:07:45] Gerard Donnelly: And that's good.
[00:07:47] Gerard Donnelly: If it doesn't feel like that, sometimes a high heart rate can mean that you've got a virus and your body's working.
[00:07:57] Gerard Donnelly: Sometimes it can mean, sometimes a period of...
[00:08:01] Gerard Donnelly: You can actually push higher heart rate and that's in a race situation.
[00:08:05] Gerard Donnelly: That's what the taper does.
[00:08:07] Gerard Donnelly: Most people can go, geez, my heart rate was high in that race, but it felt, it felt fine.
[00:08:13] Gerard Donnelly: You know, if the heart rate's high and it doesn't feel fine, that's a worry.
[00:08:18] Gerard Donnelly: If the heart rate's high and it feels okay, that sometimes means you're fresh and you can push your heart rate higher.
[00:08:27] Gerard Donnelly: Make no mistake, that's a really good time on your own.
[00:08:32] Gerard Donnelly: You know, in those races you did, you only beat that by a minute or so.
[00:08:40] Gerard Donnelly: Back in October, you're literally a minute different.
[00:08:46] Abby Jorgensen: Yeah, my chip time was actually 1.43.53 or something like that.
[00:08:52] Abby Jorgensen: So chip time wise, it's the same.
[00:08:55] Gerard Donnelly: And you're in a race compared to solo.
[00:09:00] Gerard Donnelly: And you're in freezing conditions.
[00:09:04] Gerard Donnelly: If you put that run in a race, you know, you're possibly running under 140 with people around you.
[00:09:14] Gerard Donnelly: So, yeah, I think you should be really, even though it's a hard session, you should be really happy.
[00:09:24] Gerard Donnelly: And, you know, possibly if we're looking at the mile pace, you probably should be starting at an eight-minute mile pace.
[00:09:30] Gerard Donnelly: And then trying to run 750s, which is, you know, trying to start at five-minute and trying to run 450s at the end, K pace.
[00:09:40] Gerard Donnelly: You're not fading, Abby.
[00:09:42] Gerard Donnelly: You're holding on.
[00:09:45] Gerard Donnelly: So, and I'm sure you get a few twinges of cramp, I think I was reading.
[00:09:50] Abby Jorgensen: Yeah, on our cool-down walk back to the car, I ended up like a mile away.
[00:09:56] Abby Jorgensen: And then I started to walk, jog, and all of a sudden I was like, yeah, I should probably.
[00:10:04] Gerard Donnelly: So you're very tired for Sunday obviously.
[00:10:09] Gerard Donnelly: Yeah.
[00:10:11] Gerard Donnelly: In hindsight that's probably too hard a session after that.
[00:10:15] Abby Jorgensen: I mean I think I hit everything but yeah definitely wasn't feeling it.
[00:10:22] Gerard Donnelly: We don't want to run you into the ground and yeah interesting with the FTP wasn't it?
[00:10:28] Abby Jorgensen: Yeah I was really I don't I don't know I don't know what why it did that but because I started every same spot that I've started it.
[00:10:42] Gerard Donnelly: Yeah I did have a little bit of a look I thought you know we're only really writing you know twice a week a lot of writing but yeah look maybe you should be starting at one low one
[00:11:00] Gerard Donnelly: 180s, high 170s while we're doing this.
[00:11:03] Gerard Donnelly: It's just, it's a good threshold session.
[00:11:05] Gerard Donnelly: Yeah, that's what I turned it into.
[00:11:09] Abby Jorgensen: Yeah, that's the way it's got to be.
[00:11:10] Gerard Donnelly: And it's really good that you didn't stop.
[00:11:12] Gerard Donnelly: It's really good because you would have wanted to, I'm sure.
[00:11:15] Abby Jorgensen: No, yeah, I gave it a thought, but I knew everything you've said, like, just turn it into a good session at that point.
[00:11:21] Gerard Donnelly: I still ended up with 175, Abby, so, you know, it's, you know, it just doesn't matter about the number.
[00:11:30] Gerard Donnelly: mean, you know, that's surprising that you're so far off.
[00:11:35] Gerard Donnelly: That, to me, is weird.
[00:11:38] Gerard Donnelly: But I don't really understand that.
[00:11:40] Gerard Donnelly: I don't have an answer for that.
[00:11:44] Gerard Donnelly: But, but, but yeah, that's because even Sunday, yesterday's right.
[00:11:49] Abby Jorgensen: I had all, I didn't go in and change my FTP yet because I was like, I hit all those numbers and they felt doable.
[00:11:57] Gerard Donnelly: Do you think any calibration issue here is anything?
[00:12:00] Gerard Donnelly: And I calibrated right before I rode, so.
[00:12:03] Gerard Donnelly: Yep.
[00:12:05] Gerard Donnelly: You weren't accidentally getting the kicker power.
[00:12:10] Gerard Donnelly: Mm-mm.
[00:12:11] Abby Jorgensen: Because I had the, on the TrainingPeaks virtual, it has your kicker power and then it has your pedal power separate.
[00:12:20] Gerard Donnelly: Yep.
[00:12:23] Gerard Donnelly: It's an odd one, isn't it?
[00:12:25] Gerard Donnelly: Yeah.
[00:12:26] Abby Jorgensen: I couldn't explain it either.
[00:12:27] Abby Jorgensen: So, and your heart rate wasn't exactly low, so.
[00:12:31] Gerard Donnelly: Yeah, that's the problem.
[00:12:32] Abby Jorgensen: Like once it hit 170 at like that eight minute mark, was like, there's no way I'm going to hold it.
[00:12:39] Gerard Donnelly: Yep.
[00:12:40] Abby Jorgensen: 170 on bike feels way different than 170 running.
[00:12:44] Gerard Donnelly: Yes, it does, doesn't it?
[00:12:46] Gerard Donnelly: You're at your max, whereas running, you can push the heart rate way higher.
[00:12:52] Gerard Donnelly: You know, this is a lot of the issues.
[00:12:55] Gerard Donnelly: That doesn't add up to me, Abby.
[00:12:56] Gerard Donnelly: There's something technically wrong here.
[00:12:59] Gerard Donnelly: I think.
[00:13:00] Gerard Donnelly: You're getting robbed of watts.
[00:13:01] Gerard Donnelly: Your heart rate should equate to the watts, you know, and not be 20 watts lower.
[00:13:08] Gerard Donnelly: There's something not right.
[00:13:10] Gerard Donnelly: But, yeah, really well done.
[00:13:12] Gerard Donnelly: If you were outside and you were doing out and back and you had speed, you would be going, oh, my power meter's reading low.
[00:13:21] Gerard Donnelly: And you would adjust to that lower power.
[00:13:25] Gerard Donnelly: That would be, you know, that's the problem with indoor.
[00:13:28] Gerard Donnelly: You can't get that speed function to help you, you know, because heart rate's really helpful.
[00:13:36] Gerard Donnelly: And that was reading like a 190 watts.
[00:13:41] Gerard Donnelly: So that's the only way you can explain it to your athletes if that actually happens is, you know, as a coach, would go, this is not right.
[00:13:48] Gerard Donnelly: And then the fact that you could ride those numbers three days later.
[00:13:54] Abby Jorgensen: Fatigue.
[00:13:56] Gerard Donnelly: Exhausted.
[00:13:56] Gerard Donnelly: You weren't looking the day before.
[00:13:59] Gerard Donnelly: So.
[00:14:00] Gerard Donnelly: Yeah.
[00:14:01] Gerard Donnelly: It's not a concern because we're not worried about the bike.
[00:14:04] Gerard Donnelly: We're actually training you for running.
[00:14:07] Gerard Donnelly: I wasn't.
[00:14:08] Abby Jorgensen: That's why I kept going because I was like, oh, it doesn't really matter.
[00:14:11] Abby Jorgensen: Yep.
[00:14:12] Gerard Donnelly: And that's a good mindset, you know.
[00:14:16] Gerard Donnelly: You've experienced that yourself.
[00:14:18] Gerard Donnelly: So now when someone in your coaching group, you know, stops, you've got to kind of coach them through that.
[00:14:24] Gerard Donnelly: That's not what we want.
[00:14:25] Gerard Donnelly: We want you to, you know, there could be a hundred reasons why you're feeling shocking.
[00:14:30] Gerard Donnelly: Just make a training session out of it, which is really well done by you.
[00:14:36] Gerard Donnelly: And your distance each week is just fantastic.
[00:14:40] Gerard Donnelly: You know, we're in the 70s now.
[00:14:43] Gerard Donnelly: So, you know, a couple of weeks of 70s, I think that was a race week, wasn't it?
[00:14:52] Gerard Donnelly: 60.
[00:14:52] Gerard Donnelly: But, you know, that last three weeks, last four weeks, you know, you're hovering between...
[00:15:00] Gerard Donnelly: Mid-60s to mid-70s.
[00:15:02] Gerard Donnelly: There's some good little blocks of training there, which is the most you've ever done.
[00:15:08] Gerard Donnelly: So, and, you know, this week, because we've got that half marathon, that's why I'm keen for you to really let yourself recover here.
[00:15:21] Gerard Donnelly: And if you can get outside and stay off the treadmill, that's going to be really helpful for these runs, these.
[00:15:31] Gerard Donnelly: Especially the long runs, you know, we can be creative like you have been with changing things up, but there's nothing like going outside for those runs.
[00:15:41] Gerard Donnelly: And if you find Abby that Saturday is better than Sunday, swap them over.
[00:15:45] Gerard Donnelly: Okay.
[00:15:46] Abby Jorgensen: Yeah, I mean, it looks like the next week or so, it's going to be good.
[00:15:50] Abby Jorgensen: So.
[00:15:51] Gerard Donnelly: Yep.
[00:15:52] Gerard Donnelly: So I'll leave it there.
[00:15:53] Gerard Donnelly: So, yeah, with your long run, just be nice and relaxed.
[00:15:57] Gerard Donnelly: Don't, you know, it's a long run.
[00:15:59] Gerard Donnelly: Don't, you So.
[00:15:59] Gerard Donnelly: I
[00:16:00] Gerard Donnelly: Make sure you've got enough ability to consume some fluid and if you need a gel or two, make sure you've got all that sorted, but it's a long time to be out there and yeah, these are the sessions that when it comes to the marathon, you've got that conditioning in your legs, that's what we're after.
[00:16:23] Abby Jorgensen: Yeah, the marathon in March is basically that route.
[00:16:27] Abby Jorgensen: I just ran twice.
[00:16:31] Gerard Donnelly: Terrific, yeah.
[00:16:33] Gerard Donnelly: I know that route by the back of my hand.
[00:16:37] Gerard Donnelly: And so the one hard run this week, you know, don't go overboard with the paces here, you know, we don't want your body to be in shock when you're all of a sudden just doing all these easy runs and then bang, you're running really hard.
[00:16:51] Gerard Donnelly: So just be super careful with that, you know, these are numbers that are there to remind you.
[00:17:00] Gerard Donnelly: You're going to change pace.
[00:17:01] Gerard Donnelly: A little bit harder, a little bit easier, a little bit harder, a little bit easier.
[00:17:05] Gerard Donnelly: And, you know, it's basically just 20 minutes of you running, you know, close to threshold.
[00:17:13] Gerard Donnelly: So, and, you know, next week we'll add some more Norwegian singles back in again.
[00:17:21] Gerard Donnelly: So, and then on the Sunday run, we'll run some at marathon pace.
[00:17:27] Gerard Donnelly: Okay.
[00:17:28] Gerard Donnelly: So the last, you know, last 40 minutes will, you know, run easy for the two hours and then the last 40 minutes we'll run at marathon pace.
[00:17:40] Gerard Donnelly: So you start to get to do that.
[00:17:43] Gerard Donnelly: And some of the other runs will get you to run at marathon pace.
[00:17:45] Gerard Donnelly: So you're getting really used to that marathon pace when it comes, because it's not that far away.
[00:17:49] Gerard Donnelly: it five weeks or something?
[00:17:51] Gerard Donnelly: Four weeks.
[00:17:51] Gerard Donnelly: Four weeks.
[00:17:52] Gerard Donnelly: So the next three weeks we'll, we'll have some, some specific marathon pace stuff.
[00:17:58] Gerard Donnelly: Okay.
[00:18:01] Gerard Donnelly: Any questions on you?
[00:18:03] Gerard Donnelly: No.
[00:18:04] Abby Jorgensen: Is Thursday just easy because of the half marathon I just did?
[00:18:10] Abby Jorgensen: Yeah, no.
[00:18:11] Gerard Donnelly: I want you to now make the Thursday bike really easy.
[00:18:14] Gerard Donnelly: I don't want any intensity.
[00:18:18] Gerard Donnelly: So you're going to be carrying a fever to fatigue because this is going to go back to an hour 30 and it's going to have some marathon pace in it.
[00:18:25] Gerard Donnelly: So this will be Norwegian for next week, Norwegian.
[00:18:30] Gerard Donnelly: So we don't want to be doing that and then having to ride hard.
[00:18:34] Gerard Donnelly: So we'll start to drop down the intensity on the Saturday as well and the duration and increase the run there.
[00:18:46] Gerard Donnelly: Okay.
[00:18:48] Gerard Donnelly: Yep.
[00:18:49] Abby Jorgensen: So it really swings around to a running program.
[00:18:54] Gerard Donnelly: And we can always, you know, we can pick the riding up.
[00:18:56] Gerard Donnelly: As long as you keep riding twice a week, that's fine.
[00:18:58] Gerard Donnelly: You need to get in a swim in.
[00:18:59] Gerard Donnelly: Okay.
[00:19:01] Gerard Donnelly: So you've already written this morning, so it was really good.
[00:19:04] Abby Jorgensen: Yeah, I had some adrenaline going, so I had to do something.
[00:19:09] Gerard Donnelly: Good stuff.
[00:19:13] Gerard Donnelly: Anything else on you?
[00:19:15] Gerard Donnelly: Nope, I think that's it.
[00:19:18] Abby Jorgensen: I hope you recover well.
[00:19:20] Gerard Donnelly: Yeah, I mean, the Super Bowl was boring, so there's nothing to talk about there.
[00:19:25] Gerard Donnelly: No, who are you cheering for?
[00:19:28] Abby Jorgensen: Oh, I mean, I didn't really care about the Seahawks, just because nobody likes the Patriots.
[00:19:35] Abby Jorgensen: Yeah.
[00:19:36] Gerard Donnelly: But, yeah.
[00:19:38] Abby Jorgensen: I guess it was what, it was in the morning for you, well, yeah.
[00:19:41] Gerard Donnelly: It was, it was all morning.
[00:19:43] Gerard Donnelly: Yeah, man, it's become popular here.
[00:19:47] Gerard Donnelly: Yeah.
[00:19:49] Gerard Donnelly: I think people like watching the pre-game stuff more than the actual game.
[00:19:53] Abby Jorgensen: Well, I mean, a lot of people here were more hyped for the halftime show.
[00:19:57] Gerard Donnelly: So, yeah.
[00:19:58] Abby Jorgensen: Just because of what it represents.
[00:20:00] Abby Jorgensen: Yeah.
[00:20:01] Gerard Donnelly: I was coming in and out watching it.
[00:20:06] Gerard Donnelly: I'm not used to seeing so much advertising in a sporting event.
[00:20:10] Gerard Donnelly: It just blows my mind how it's almost like the advertising is more important than the event.
[00:20:15] Gerard Donnelly: Yeah.
[00:20:16] Abby Jorgensen: They make a big deal about it.
[00:20:18] Abby Jorgensen: Yeah.
[00:20:19] Gerard Donnelly: Yeah.
[00:20:20] Abby Jorgensen: So, yeah.
[00:20:21] Abby Jorgensen: Now we just watch the Olympics.
[00:20:23] Abby Jorgensen: So, yeah.
[00:20:24] Abby Jorgensen: Yeah.
[00:20:24] Abby Jorgensen: You like the Winter Olympics?
[00:20:25] Gerard Donnelly: like watching?
[00:20:26] Gerard Donnelly: Yeah.
[00:20:27] Abby Jorgensen: I didn't used to, but now, I don't know.
[00:20:29] Abby Jorgensen: I appreciate the Winter.
[00:20:31] Abby Jorgensen: Seems like a little bit more higher risk sports in the Winter Olympics.
[00:20:35] Gerard Donnelly: Yeah.
[00:20:36] Gerard Donnelly: Especially with that girl breaking her leg.
[00:20:38] Gerard Donnelly: my God.
[00:20:39] Gerard Donnelly: God, she's been through everything.
[00:20:42] Abby Jorgensen: Pair her ACL and then break your leg.
[00:20:45] Gerard Donnelly: Yeah.
[00:20:46] Gerard Donnelly: Can't say she's not trying.
[00:20:49] Gerard Donnelly: Yeah.
[00:20:49] Gerard Donnelly: I mean, she's 41, too.
[00:20:51] Gerard Donnelly: So.
[00:20:51] Gerard Donnelly: Yeah.
[00:20:52] Gerard Donnelly: Yeah.
[00:20:54] Gerard Donnelly: She got that line wrong, didn't she?
[00:20:56] Gerard Donnelly: She hit that flag.
[00:20:59] Gerard Donnelly: Yeah.
[00:21:01] Gerard Donnelly: Like, they're doing 100 kilometers an hour.
[00:21:03] Gerard Donnelly: What are they doing?
[00:21:04] Gerard Donnelly: That's at 60 miles an hour, 70 miles an hour.
[00:21:06] Gerard Donnelly: Yeah, I can't imagine.
[00:21:07] Abby Jorgensen: I can't imagine being healthy going down that.
[00:21:10] Abby Jorgensen: And she had a torn ACL going down that.
[00:21:12] Abby Jorgensen: Yeah.
[00:21:13] Gerard Donnelly: All right.
[00:21:14] Gerard Donnelly: Let's hook into Coco's Landed in Australia.
[00:21:17] Abby Jorgensen: Has she messaged you or anything?
[00:21:19] Abby Jorgensen: Yeah, yeah.
[00:21:20] Abby Jorgensen: She messaged me yesterday.
[00:21:22] Gerard Donnelly: She wants to meet me for coffee.
[00:21:24] Gerard Donnelly: Okay.
[00:21:26] Gerard Donnelly: So I said I'd try to meet her today, but I actually can't now.
[00:21:30] Gerard Donnelly: I've got an echocardiogram, which is a test.
[00:21:32] Gerard Donnelly: So I can't do it.
[00:21:37] Gerard Donnelly: So I thought I might catch her after it.
[00:21:42] Gerard Donnelly: And she lives with Tommy, and Tommy's quite a long way from where I am.
[00:21:47] Gerard Donnelly: It's at least an hour's drive.
[00:21:52] Gerard Donnelly: So maybe I'll catch up with her somewhere.
[00:21:54] Gerard Donnelly: She's here for three weeks.
[00:21:55] Gerard Donnelly: So yeah, her biggest thing was routes or different ways,
[00:22:00] Abby Jorgensen: There's a ride and stuff too.
[00:22:04] Gerard Donnelly: Well, Tommy will take her down to, for this weekend, he'll take her down where he's going to ride, down at Mount Martha.
[00:22:15] Gerard Donnelly: And it's really undulating, Abby.
[00:22:18] Gerard Donnelly: There's hardly any flat bits on it.
[00:22:22] Gerard Donnelly: And Tommy's ridden that regularly.
[00:22:24] Gerard Donnelly: So, yeah, they're doing a slightly different session.
[00:22:28] Gerard Donnelly: She's doing a straight 180 and he's doing intervals.
[00:22:32] Gerard Donnelly: But they can do it together on the same course.
[00:22:35] Gerard Donnelly: Okay.
[00:22:35] Gerard Donnelly: And he can't run because he's had a little bit of an injury.
[00:22:39] Gerard Donnelly: So he sees his physio on Friday and he's doing 30 seconds on, 90 seconds off at the moment, which is quite disappointing for him.
[00:22:49] Gerard Donnelly: He's quite a good runner.
[00:22:52] Gerard Donnelly: Yeah, I didn't.
[00:22:52] Abby Jorgensen: Like, she rode, I had a race ready in, on there, but she, I don't know, after this weekend, she's like, was rare.
[00:23:07] Abby Jorgensen: I think that's really good.
[00:23:11] Gerard Donnelly: That's a big day for her.
[00:23:13] Gerard Donnelly: Yeah.
[00:23:14] Gerard Donnelly: Yeah.
[00:23:15] Abby Jorgensen: didn't know where else we would have a day like that because it's actually fairly quickly.
[00:23:20] Abby Jorgensen: It feels like what?
[00:23:20] Abby Jorgensen: Four weeks away?
[00:23:23] Gerard Donnelly: Three weeks.
[00:23:24] Gerard Donnelly: Yeah.
[00:23:25] Gerard Donnelly: Yeah.
[00:23:27] Gerard Donnelly: Yeah.
[00:23:29] Gerard Donnelly: Yeah.
[00:23:29] Gerard Donnelly: Yeah.
[00:23:29] Gerard Donnelly: This is really the last big session for her.
[00:23:34] Gerard Donnelly: So if she's eight, pardon me, if she's able, you probably should have her do an easy run.
[00:23:47] Gerard Donnelly: Sorry.
[00:23:51] Gerard Donnelly: My voice.
[00:23:53] Gerard Donnelly: She's got the swim clinic.
[00:23:55] Gerard Donnelly: Just another easy run in the afternoon would be okay.
[00:23:58] Gerard Donnelly: Okay.
[00:24:00] Gerard Donnelly: Because you just get that fourth run.
[00:24:04] Gerard Donnelly: Okay, yeah.
[00:24:05] Gerard Donnelly: I just think, okay.
[00:24:07] Gerard Donnelly: She's got the, because she's got, she's got a ride today, a good ride tomorrow, a good ride Thursday, a great ride.
[00:24:17] Gerard Donnelly: So that's three great rides.
[00:24:22] Gerard Donnelly: And so if we can, she's running, when did she run?
[00:24:27] Gerard Donnelly: ran today.
[00:24:27] Gerard Donnelly: She's running Thursday, that's great.
[00:24:30] Abby Jorgensen: I didn't know, since her miles are, since her pace is so high, like, she had been getting close to, like, 40 miles.
[00:24:38] Abby Jorgensen: So I don't know what that is in kilometers.
[00:24:41] Abby Jorgensen: I don't know how much we wanted her to.
[00:24:44] Abby Jorgensen: Yeah, that's 60K, I think.
[00:24:47] Gerard Donnelly: Yeah, 60K?
[00:24:49] Gerard Donnelly: Yeah, around that 60 is fine.
[00:24:56] Gerard Donnelly: So, yeah, I would just get her to do another easy run.
[00:24:59] Gerard Donnelly: So,
[00:25:00] Gerard Donnelly: You know, because she's going to be very fatigued from that.
[00:25:03] Gerard Donnelly: And Brenton's, it's not, it's a very technical clinic.
[00:25:06] Gerard Donnelly: There's not a lot of swimming.
[00:25:08] Gerard Donnelly: Okay.
[00:25:10] Gerard Donnelly: So it's really him filming to start with.
[00:25:13] Gerard Donnelly: Then he gets you to do some drills and he films you, then sits everybody down.
[00:25:22] Gerard Donnelly: And then there's only five in the clinic.
[00:25:25] Gerard Donnelly: And then he shows everybody that thinks that he's trying to improve.
[00:25:30] Gerard Donnelly: And then you go and do the drills, trying to practice these improvements.
[00:25:34] Gerard Donnelly: And then he films you again and then goes through it again.
[00:25:38] Gerard Donnelly: So there's not a great deal of swimming, which is fine.
[00:25:46] Gerard Donnelly: So, yeah, so get her to run again, if you can.
[00:25:54] Gerard Donnelly: But tell her it's just got to be nice and easy.
[00:25:57] Gerard Donnelly: Okay.
[00:25:58] Gerard Donnelly: Yeah.
[00:25:59] Gerard Donnelly: How long?
[00:26:01] Abby Jorgensen: 30 to 40 minutes is fine.
[00:26:11] Abby Jorgensen: Speaking of, she just messaged me.
[00:26:21] Gerard Donnelly: What's she saying?
[00:26:22] Abby Jorgensen: It's something about how many days usually until that feverish feeling is gone after a long run.
[00:26:29] Abby Jorgensen: I don't know what means.
[00:26:31] Gerard Donnelly: Feverish feeling?
[00:26:33] Gerard Donnelly: Yeah, gone again after a long run.
[00:26:36] Abby Jorgensen: What's that mean?
[00:26:37] Gerard Donnelly: I don't know.
[00:26:38] Gerard Donnelly: What do you mean?
[00:26:44] Abby Jorgensen: She's probably just not used to running that long.
[00:26:48] Abby Jorgensen: How many miles did she hit yesterday?
[00:26:50] Abby Jorgensen: was pretty, it was quite a few.
[00:26:53] Gerard Donnelly: 15K, so that's nine miles, is it?
[00:26:57] Gerard Donnelly: 22 miles.
[00:26:58] Gerard Donnelly: 6.
[00:26:58] Gerard Donnelly: 6.
[00:26:58] Gerard Donnelly: 30 minutes.
[00:26:59] Gerard Donnelly: You
[00:27:00] Gerard Donnelly: 15k, Yeah.
[00:27:02] Gerard Donnelly: And 4.47, yeah.
[00:27:04] Gerard Donnelly: Interesting to see what pace she can run off a bike.
[00:27:07] Gerard Donnelly: Yeah, me too, for two hours.
[00:27:10] Gerard Donnelly: Hmm.
[00:27:11] Abby Jorgensen: What did she run her long run last Sunday at?
[00:27:18] Abby Jorgensen: 4.38.
[00:27:20] Gerard Donnelly: For two and a half hours.
[00:27:22] Abby Jorgensen: Hmm.
[00:27:25] Gerard Donnelly: Our race, the race was right here.
[00:27:29] Gerard Donnelly: Yeah, there was an Olympic distance.
[00:27:32] Gerard Donnelly: We had 30 athletes do a race here.
[00:27:34] Gerard Donnelly: So she's basically run right to the race.
[00:27:37] Gerard Donnelly: She messaged me saying they were going to stop in because we had the tent there.
[00:27:40] Gerard Donnelly: Oh, okay.
[00:27:42] Gerard Donnelly: Yeah, that's pancake flat, which is absolutely fine.
[00:27:49] Gerard Donnelly: But for her next run down here, definitely don't do that race.
[00:27:56] Gerard Donnelly: Don't?
[00:27:56] Gerard Donnelly: Okay.
[00:27:57] Gerard Donnelly: No.
[00:27:58] Gerard Donnelly: No, that's just...
[00:27:59] Gerard Donnelly: You
[00:28:00] Gerard Donnelly: That's a waste of the day.
[00:28:02] Gerard Donnelly: Okay.
[00:28:03] Abby Jorgensen: She thinks it's the heat, probably.
[00:28:07] Abby Jorgensen: Okay.
[00:28:08] Gerard Donnelly: Well, it's not hot this morning.
[00:28:11] Gerard Donnelly: Yeah.
[00:28:12] Abby Jorgensen: I think she might be referring to Sunday's run.
[00:28:16] Abby Jorgensen: Yes.
[00:28:16] Abby Jorgensen: Okay.
[00:28:17] Gerard Donnelly: Yeah.
[00:28:18] Gerard Donnelly: Sunday was hot, Abby.
[00:28:19] Gerard Donnelly: was 32, which is, you know, 90 degrees.
[00:28:23] Gerard Donnelly: And it was humid as well.
[00:28:27] Gerard Donnelly: It was 80% humidity or something.
[00:28:30] Gerard Donnelly: So very Bali-like.
[00:28:33] Gerard Donnelly: That's like here in the summer.
[00:28:36] Abby Jorgensen: Yes.
[00:28:36] Abby Jorgensen: Yeah.
[00:28:38] Gerard Donnelly: And I think make sure that she's not starting to run fast in this two-hour, you know.
[00:28:46] Gerard Donnelly: So I haven't thought about her marathon pace yet.
[00:28:51] Gerard Donnelly: Have you ever think about what you think she can run?
[00:28:55] Abby Jorgensen: I mean, according to, I think when I, I mean, I had it in there.
[00:29:00] Abby Jorgensen: I mean, for sure, right around that, I mean, maybe even under that three-hour pace for her.
[00:29:09] Abby Jorgensen: Because what it was her, let's see.
[00:29:12] Gerard Donnelly: What did she run at the Worlds?
[00:29:17] Gerard Donnelly: She ran a.
[00:29:18] Gerard Donnelly: Let me look.
[00:29:19] Abby Jorgensen: I have the sheet pulled up.
[00:29:21] Abby Jorgensen: She did a 120, didn't she?
[00:29:22] Gerard Donnelly: she run 120?
[00:29:23] Abby Jorgensen: Like a 123.
[00:29:27] Abby Jorgensen: 123.
[00:29:33] Gerard Donnelly: I wonder what she can run fresh.
[00:29:35] Gerard Donnelly: What's her best half marathon?
[00:29:39] Gerard Donnelly: Has she done a marathon at all, Abby?
[00:29:41] Abby Jorgensen: I don't think she hasn't done a marathon with us.
[00:29:44] Abby Jorgensen: I don't know if she's ever done a marathon.
[00:29:46] Abby Jorgensen: She's done a fresh progressive half marathon.
[00:29:53] Abby Jorgensen: It says 124.
[00:29:55] Abby Jorgensen: Yeah, okay.
[00:29:56] Abby Jorgensen: I don't know how fresh that was, actually.
[00:29:59] Gerard Donnelly: I mean.
[00:29:59] Gerard Donnelly: there.
[00:30:00] Gerard Donnelly: Well,.20, let's say 1.23 in a race is 2.46 and you, you know, you're probably going to add 30 minutes to that.
[00:30:09] Gerard Donnelly: So that's 3.15.
[00:30:11] Gerard Donnelly: 3.15.
[00:30:12] Gerard Donnelly: So what pace is that?
[00:30:16] Abby Jorgensen: 4.37.
[00:30:17] Gerard Donnelly: That's exactly what she's been running, 4.37, which is pretty funny.
[00:30:25] Gerard Donnelly: I would be saying to her when she gets off the bike, you know, just start easy at five minute K pace.
[00:30:31] Gerard Donnelly: And then, you know, as you gradually go through the two hours, try to run on the flat if you can, where they are at Mornington, where she's going to do the bike.
[00:30:43] Gerard Donnelly: At the other end of the course is pancake flat at where the start.
[00:30:49] Gerard Donnelly: So the start goes really undulating and then they do a yui and they just go back and it's all undulating.
[00:30:55] Gerard Donnelly: But at the other end of the course, it's pancake flat.
[00:30:58] Gerard Donnelly: So she's.
[00:31:00] Gerard Donnelly: She's better off parking at the other end of the course because they take the freeway down there anyway.
[00:31:06] Gerard Donnelly: And if she parked her car, and that's what I'll be telling Tommy, I'll be telling Tommy this, at the Safety Beach Car Park Yacht Club, that's the flat bit of the rain course.
[00:31:20] Gerard Donnelly: So when she gets back to her car, she's not having to run any hills.
[00:31:23] Gerard Donnelly: I mean, there is a hill at New Zealand, but we don't need to get her to run in the hill.
[00:31:32] Gerard Donnelly: So you need to convey to her that you don't want her running, you know, 440 pace straight away.
[00:31:40] Gerard Donnelly: You want her running 5-minute K pace.
[00:31:44] Gerard Donnelly: And if she can get faster, then we would encourage that down to...
[00:31:50] Gerard Donnelly: And you can tell her, look, you know, we think you can run somewhere between 310 and 320 for the marathon.
[00:32:00] Gerard Donnelly: And this is a good test to see what you can do for two hours.
[00:32:07] Gerard Donnelly: And I'll, you know, I'm going to be talking to her at some stage because she's texting me about, so if I'm, you know, I'll be reiterating that to her as well.
[00:32:17] Gerard Donnelly: So, but yeah, sometimes, Abby, I would, I would have this hidden.
[00:32:26] Gerard Donnelly: So I'd have this just next to her session like this, and then I would hide it.
[00:32:31] Gerard Donnelly: And that's me thinking, well, this is what I think she can run.
[00:32:34] Gerard Donnelly: And then after she's done that session, I'll be checking on, what did I think again?
[00:32:38] Gerard Donnelly: Because, you know, thinking of me, so many athletes you coach.
[00:32:41] Gerard Donnelly: Oh, yeah, I thought maybe she could run 3.15.
[00:32:44] Gerard Donnelly: And I would do a little note, you know, based on World Champs, which you run at 1.23, was it?
[00:32:52] Gerard Donnelly: Yeah, 1.23.
[00:32:54] Gerard Donnelly: 1.23, which is, you know, 2.46 equals.
[00:33:00] Gerard Donnelly: 3.15.
[00:33:03] Gerard Donnelly: So that's kind of, if I could spell based properly, that would be better.
[00:33:10] Gerard Donnelly: So stuff like that I'm doing all the time.
[00:33:12] Gerard Donnelly: And, you know, and then I would have some, you know, I would have something like, you know, I would go through and say, three hours equals, you know, I'd just, I'd have my own graph here.
[00:33:31] Gerard Donnelly: Three hours equals 4.16 pace.
[00:33:34] Gerard Donnelly: You know, then I'd go, what's 3.05?
[00:33:39] Gerard Donnelly: And I'd just keep, you know, keep a tab of this, so that when you're talking to your athlete, you've got clear understanding of, you know, what is 3.05, what's 3.10.
[00:33:52] Gerard Donnelly: And then, some, from the training sessions, you can really narrow in.
[00:34:01] Gerard Donnelly: You know, what we think we can do on race day.
[00:34:04] Gerard Donnelly: This is where we're trying to find out.
[00:34:13] Gerard Donnelly: It's a little bit of a process, but it's well worth doing, I think.
[00:34:17] Gerard Donnelly: So you've got clear.
[00:34:20] Gerard Donnelly: And you can go and get a table for this.
[00:34:23] Gerard Donnelly: But for me, literally, it's taken what?
[00:34:26] Gerard Donnelly: One minute?
[00:34:27] Gerard Donnelly: Yeah.
[00:34:28] Gerard Donnelly: And we've got a really good gauge.
[00:34:31] Gerard Donnelly: And, you know, I would go a little bit further than, you know, what I hope she's doing, just for my own sake to know, you know, what is, you know, what pace do I have to do to do a, between, you know, there at 4.16 and 4.50.
[00:34:50] Gerard Donnelly: Like, I don't think she's capable of running a 3.05.
[00:34:57] Gerard Donnelly: I just don't think, I don't think that.
[00:35:00] Gerard Donnelly: That's in her wheelhouse, you know, I think she's more like, that would be an outstanding run, Abby, to run 310.
[00:35:07] Gerard Donnelly: I think she's more on the day, probably going to be running 320, somewhere between those two.
[00:35:13] Gerard Donnelly: I could be totally wrong, but that's basically where I feel she is, somewhere in there from what she's done.
[00:35:18] Gerard Donnelly: You know, you can't always just double it because, you know, how much long running is she, you know, is she capable of, you know, she's run 30K at 437.
[00:35:34] Gerard Donnelly: She's run 30, nearly 32K at 437.
[00:35:37] Gerard Donnelly: Could she have kept that going?
[00:35:39] Gerard Donnelly: You know, that would be a question I'd ask her.
[00:35:44] Gerard Donnelly: You know, she's saying it's all easy, you know, and that's pretty good to hear that, but I'll be asking her, could you have kept that going, you know, for another 11K?
[00:36:00] Gerard Donnelly: And then obviously we've got to, you know, imagine what can you do after 180.
[00:36:05] Gerard Donnelly: That's fresh.
[00:36:06] Gerard Donnelly: It's not fresh.
[00:36:06] Gerard Donnelly: It's, you've done that the day before.
[00:36:09] Gerard Donnelly: But yeah, so, you know, she's proving that, that she can run, you know, if she's saying that's easy, that's, that's the thing that I'm, I'd be asking her, you know, was it when you say easy, could you have kept going at that pace or, or run faster?
[00:36:24] Gerard Donnelly: But, and if she's, if you've got be careful with egos with some people, they might just say that.
[00:36:30] Gerard Donnelly: Yeah.
[00:36:31] Abby Jorgensen: Especially with running.
[00:36:33] Gerard Donnelly: Yeah.
[00:36:34] Gerard Donnelly: you know, with it all.
[00:36:38] Abby Jorgensen: Should I do a 180 there, or?
[00:36:43] Gerard Donnelly: Yeah, I would, I would get her to do probably a 160 there and get her to ride at the top of the range.
[00:36:50] Gerard Donnelly: Okay.
[00:36:52] Gerard Donnelly: And then maybe the next day, try to get her to run a, a hard, a hard 30k.
[00:36:59] Gerard Donnelly: Okay.
[00:37:00] Gerard Donnelly: Because she's going to have an easy week, Abby.
[00:37:02] Gerard Donnelly: That's going to be an easy week into that testing weekend.
[00:37:07] Gerard Donnelly: And then she's got the race week.
[00:37:09] Gerard Donnelly: So she's got plenty of time to recover.
[00:37:12] Gerard Donnelly: And you know, you know, the Norwegians, the week before Kona, they did frigging 42k run.
[00:37:22] Gerard Donnelly: You know, they did a marathon.
[00:37:25] Gerard Donnelly: So I think we'll be fine doing a 30k there.
[00:37:29] Abby Jorgensen: Yeah.
[00:37:29] Abby Jorgensen: I feel like I did a 30k, like three weeks.
[00:37:33] Gerard Donnelly: Yeah.
[00:37:34] Gerard Donnelly: Yeah.
[00:37:35] Gerard Donnelly: Any questions on her?
[00:37:37] Abby Jorgensen: No, that was just the biggest one just to make sure.
[00:37:42] Abby Jorgensen: We got everything right for three weeks out.
[00:37:46] Gerard Donnelly: So I might just I might just line Tommy up with.
[00:37:52] Gerard Donnelly: He's a bit different because he hasn't been able to run.
[00:37:54] Gerard Donnelly: Yeah.
[00:37:55] Gerard Donnelly: So I've been given him more bikes.
[00:37:58] Gerard Donnelly: Yeah.
[00:38:00] Gerard Donnelly: So, oops, so he's doing swim, then he did a LT1 today.
[00:38:09] Gerard Donnelly: He ran, you know, 30, 30, 90 yesterday.
[00:38:15] Gerard Donnelly: He's only allowed to run Monday and Wednesday, and then he's seeing the doctor.
[00:38:20] Gerard Donnelly: So, so he's got zone three, zone two, sub-threshold, similar to what you've got, sub-threshold on Thursday.
[00:38:31] Gerard Donnelly: Okay, and then he's got a swim or open water, and then he's got the intervals, and then a run off the bike.
[00:38:40] Gerard Donnelly: And I'm waiting to hear what happens with Dr.
[00:38:43] Gerard Donnelly: Mitch before I, I'm just assuming he's allowed to run properly.
[00:38:49] Gerard Donnelly: And then I've got him doing another ride, because if he can't run, he has to keep riding.
[00:38:56] Gerard Donnelly: So, if he's allowed to run, I won't be getting him to ride.
[00:39:00] Gerard Donnelly: I'll get him to run there after the swimming clinic, okay?
[00:39:06] Gerard Donnelly: Okay.
[00:39:12] Gerard Donnelly: And, yeah, so two weeks of that.
[00:39:14] Gerard Donnelly: So he's saying they arrive and they're driving to Taupo.
[00:39:21] Gerard Donnelly: So that'll be fine.
[00:39:23] Gerard Donnelly: Good.
[00:39:26] Gerard Donnelly: All right.
[00:39:27] Gerard Donnelly: We better keep moving, eh?
[00:39:29] Gerard Donnelly: Yeah.
[00:39:30] Abby Jorgensen: Yeah.
[00:39:31] Gerard Donnelly: I feel like everybody is good.
[00:39:34] Abby Jorgensen: They're very good.
[00:39:35] Abby Jorgensen: They start from the bottom, eh?
[00:39:36] Gerard Donnelly: Yeah.
[00:39:38] Gerard Donnelly: James?
[00:39:39] Gerard Donnelly: Oh, we're, I think we're right on track.
[00:39:41] Abby Jorgensen: We got him, he got his Wahoo.
[00:39:45] Abby Jorgensen: Yeah.
[00:39:45] Abby Jorgensen: He's definitely not used to riding indoors because his FTP wasn't the greatest, but he, like, I mean, we've had a talk.
[00:39:55] Abby Jorgensen: He just knows he just didn't know what he was doing, really.
[00:39:59] Abby Jorgensen: Yeah.
[00:39:59] Abby Jorgensen: A lot of
[00:40:00] Abby Jorgensen: But we got everything situated there.
[00:40:02] Abby Jorgensen: at least like he lives in London.
[00:40:06] Gerard Donnelly: So it's always confusing when you live in London.
[00:40:11] Abby Jorgensen: Yeah, he wrote on Zwift.
[00:40:13] Abby Jorgensen: We were having troubles at first.
[00:40:15] Abby Jorgensen: And so I put him on Zwift and then got things up and running.
[00:40:21] Abby Jorgensen: So, yeah.
[00:40:24] Abby Jorgensen: But yeah, he struggled with his he had a he did a 5k the weekend before.
[00:40:29] Abby Jorgensen: And then at 4k, he felt his calf tighten up.
[00:40:32] Abby Jorgensen: So he stopped.
[00:40:34] Abby Jorgensen: I don't know.
[00:40:35] Abby Jorgensen: But like he was running a pretty decent pace.
[00:40:39] Abby Jorgensen: So at least I kind of have a general idea.
[00:40:41] Gerard Donnelly: Yeah.
[00:40:43] Gerard Donnelly: Yeah, he's running 4k pace.
[00:40:44] Gerard Donnelly: Yeah.
[00:40:45] Gerard Donnelly: So.
[00:40:49] Abby Jorgensen: Yeah.
[00:40:50] Abby Jorgensen: I mean, I was like, it's smart.
[00:40:51] Abby Jorgensen: I guess it was smart for him to stop.
[00:40:53] Abby Jorgensen: I didn't want him to do anything.
[00:40:55] Gerard Donnelly: Yeah.
[00:40:57] Abby Jorgensen: I mean, 4k is better than nothing.
[00:40:59] Abby Jorgensen: So.
[00:40:59] Abby Jorgensen: Okay.
[00:41:00] Abby Jorgensen: Okay.
[00:41:02] Gerard Donnelly: I think, what have you given him?
[00:41:10] Gerard Donnelly: That was last week.
[00:41:12] Abby Jorgensen: Yeah, so he didn't run on Sunday?
[00:41:15] Abby Jorgensen: Yeah, he went to a party Saturday and got hungover.
[00:41:18] Gerard Donnelly: Yep.
[00:41:19] Abby Jorgensen: I just talked to him.
[00:41:21] Abby Jorgensen: Yep, and you pushed it to Monday.
[00:41:23] Gerard Donnelly: Is calf's okay?
[00:41:24] Gerard Donnelly: Yeah, he says it feels fine now.
[00:41:26] Abby Jorgensen: He doesn't know if it was just the faster running or what it was.
[00:41:31] Gerard Donnelly: Yeah, that's good, Abby.
[00:41:34] Gerard Donnelly: So remind me, he hasn't got a race for ages, he?
[00:41:37] Gerard Donnelly: He hasn't even registered for one.
[00:41:39] Abby Jorgensen: The new one that just popped up in Paris, the new Ironman, he thinks he's going to do that one.
[00:41:48] Abby Jorgensen: Ironman or 70.3?
[00:41:49] Gerard Donnelly: 70.3.
[00:41:50] Gerard Donnelly: Yeah.
[00:41:51] Gerard Donnelly: What month?
[00:41:54] Gerard Donnelly: July, I believe.
[00:41:56] Gerard Donnelly: Yeah.
[00:41:58] Gerard Donnelly: I'm just about to know.
[00:41:58] Gerard Donnelly: Yeah.
[00:41:59] Gerard Donnelly: Yeah.
[00:42:02] Abby Jorgensen: Because he was looking at all of some other races, and a lot of them were sold out in that region.
[00:42:07] Abby Jorgensen: Yeah, the whole of Europe.
[00:42:10] Abby Jorgensen: Yeah, so there's a new one, I guess, that just popped up.
[00:42:14] Abby Jorgensen: I mean, it would be pretty sweet to race in Paris.
[00:42:17] Gerard Donnelly: It would be, yeah.
[00:42:19] Gerard Donnelly: He needs to.
[00:42:23] Gerard Donnelly: So it would be interesting to see, he's got his FTP and everything set up properly.
[00:42:27] Gerard Donnelly: How did he go on Saturday?
[00:42:30] Abby Jorgensen: It wasn't set up correctly in Swift, but he was a little higher.
[00:42:35] Abby Jorgensen: We sorted that out after the fact.
[00:42:37] Abby Jorgensen: Did Swift have a higher FTP setting?
[00:42:40] Gerard Donnelly: Yeah.
[00:42:41] Gerard Donnelly: Yeah.
[00:42:41] Gerard Donnelly: And now he's clear that he knows there's two settings in TrainingPeaks.
[00:42:45] Gerard Donnelly: Yep.
[00:42:46] Gerard Donnelly: So he handled that all right, Abby?
[00:42:48] Gerard Donnelly: you think?
[00:42:48] Abby Jorgensen: Yeah, he said he didn't feel terrible.
[00:42:51] Gerard Donnelly: Do you think we should test him again with the FTP because of now he's understanding how to do it?
[00:42:59] Gerard Donnelly: What do you think?
[00:43:00] Gerard Donnelly: I that's fine.
[00:43:02] Abby Jorgensen: Um, I want to see how his first higher intensity goes.
[00:43:07] Gerard Donnelly: yeah, so.
[00:43:08] Abby Jorgensen: It's the zone two.
[00:43:09] Abby Jorgensen: So I want to see how, like, tomorrow's.
[00:43:11] Abby Jorgensen: Yep.
[00:43:11] Abby Jorgensen: If five minutes.
[00:43:13] Gerard Donnelly: Yep.
[00:43:13] Abby Jorgensen: Yeah.
[00:43:14] Abby Jorgensen: Yep.
[00:43:15] Abby Jorgensen: And say that to him next time you're talking to him.
[00:43:19] Gerard Donnelly: Um, I would probably, I would start him on the 60-60s, Abby.
[00:43:25] Gerard Donnelly: Okay.
[00:43:26] Gerard Donnelly: There's nothing wrong with the 30-30s.
[00:43:27] Gerard Donnelly: Absolutely nothing.
[00:43:29] Gerard Donnelly: Okay.
[00:43:29] Gerard Donnelly: They're probably too, I think they're too easy.
[00:43:34] Gerard Donnelly: They're not that easy.
[00:43:38] Gerard Donnelly: I think, I think getting him used to pushing one minute VO2 is probably better.
[00:43:44] Gerard Donnelly: Okay.
[00:43:49] Gerard Donnelly: The intensity is at 0.85 and it's 0.8 here.
[00:43:55] Gerard Donnelly: Um, the TSS is 82 and the TSS here is 70.
[00:44:01] Gerard Donnelly: So that says it's supposed to be a little bit harder, but that's okay.
[00:44:08] Gerard Donnelly: There's nothing wrong with it.
[00:44:09] Gerard Donnelly: I just prefer that first block to have longer VO2.
[00:44:14] Gerard Donnelly: And then we go 40, 20, 30, 15 over the 12 weeks.
[00:44:19] Gerard Donnelly: Okay.
[00:44:20] Abby Jorgensen: Instead of, I guess, yeah.
[00:44:23] Gerard Donnelly: Yeah.
[00:44:23] Gerard Donnelly: So you get longer rest for 60 seconds.
[00:44:28] Gerard Donnelly: And then as you get into the 30, 15s, it's like, whoa.
[00:44:31] Abby Jorgensen: Yeah.
[00:44:32] Abby Jorgensen: Yeah.
[00:44:32] Abby Jorgensen: Those are the worst.
[00:44:34] Gerard Donnelly: Yeah.
[00:44:35] Gerard Donnelly: They are.
[00:44:39] Gerard Donnelly: So don't be afraid to push his longer ride longer.
[00:44:44] Gerard Donnelly: Okay.
[00:44:45] Gerard Donnelly: Okay.
[00:44:48] Gerard Donnelly: Absolutely nothing wrong with that program.
[00:44:50] Gerard Donnelly: But we want to have, I would say, if he's got time, another, another.
[00:45:00] Gerard Donnelly: Right.
[00:45:00] Gerard Donnelly: His riding's not good.
[00:45:03] Gerard Donnelly: So I'll be saying a recovery ride here, just where you're giving him, you're getting him to practice cadence and stuff.
[00:45:10] Gerard Donnelly: You know, it's just purely recovery and you're telling him it's for recovery, but also for you to learn how to pedal better and practice riding at, you know, at high RPM.
[00:45:24] Gerard Donnelly: So if we gave him something like, you know, a 30-minute spin, you know, and he might, I don't know what his hours are like.
[00:45:34] Gerard Donnelly: I think he can a lot in the mornings, isn't he?
[00:45:38] Abby Jorgensen: He can get to the gym in the morning to, like, swim or do weights and then.
[00:45:43] Gerard Donnelly: So when he's at the swim, is this where he's doing the swim class at the gym?
[00:45:47] Gerard Donnelly: Yeah, at the gym.
[00:45:48] Gerard Donnelly: Tell him to jump on the gym bike, just roll his legs over for 20 minutes.
[00:45:52] Gerard Donnelly: And try and get the cadence up.
[00:45:55] Gerard Donnelly: Okay.
[00:45:56] Gerard Donnelly: Okay.
[00:46:00] Gerard Donnelly: And so, yeah, that's fine.
[00:46:05] Gerard Donnelly: Those three sessions are good.
[00:46:06] Gerard Donnelly: And if he gets, you know, that's five bike sessions.
[00:46:10] Gerard Donnelly: We really want to push his bike.
[00:46:12] Gerard Donnelly: He's quite a competent runner.
[00:46:14] Gerard Donnelly: He's a very average swimmer.
[00:46:15] Gerard Donnelly: So if we can keep the four runs going and four or five bikes, and that doesn't really count as a bike.
[00:46:24] Gerard Donnelly: It's just time on time pedaling.
[00:46:27] Gerard Donnelly: That's all.
[00:46:28] Gerard Donnelly: Okay.
[00:46:30] Gerard Donnelly: Cool.
[00:46:37] Gerard Donnelly: And as I said to you a few weeks ago, I'm just trying to stop these people coming on and off the program.
[00:46:45] Gerard Donnelly: You know, we just haven't had a lot of inquiries in the last month.
[00:46:49] Gerard Donnelly: So it's really important that the new people get a really good experience from you.
[00:46:54] Gerard Donnelly: And you are great at this, Abby, but keep communicating with them.
[00:46:58] Gerard Donnelly: We
[00:47:00] Gerard Donnelly: So that, you know, they feel like they're being looked after, which you do well.
[00:47:03] Gerard Donnelly: So keep that as your focus.
[00:47:05] Gerard Donnelly: My job is to make sure that they get the right program, they're enjoying it, and that I'm communicating with them, you know.
[00:47:14] Gerard Donnelly: And you know the ones that you need more communication with, you know the ones you need less.
[00:47:18] Gerard Donnelly: The ones that you've already got their confidence, you know, they trust you, that's great.
[00:47:24] Gerard Donnelly: You don't have to communicate as much, but keep consistent.
[00:47:26] Gerard Donnelly: But the new people, you need for them to get confident that you're in their corner.
[00:47:34] Gerard Donnelly: Yeah.
[00:47:35] Gerard Donnelly: And I need to say that so that you just remind me, because I was just looking at our last one year, we had 120 people apply and join, and we had 40 pull off.
[00:47:49] Gerard Donnelly: So that's a third.
[00:47:51] Gerard Donnelly: It's too many.
[00:47:54] Gerard Donnelly: And I can't say any of it was bad coaching.
[00:47:58] Gerard Donnelly: It's just weird.
[00:48:00] Gerard Donnelly: Yeah, it's just really, you know, yeah, so that's my focus for this year is to really make sure that we get everybody who joins a good experience, get their trust, and have them for a long period.
[00:48:14] Gerard Donnelly: Yeah.
[00:48:18] Gerard Donnelly: So, Scott?
[00:48:21] Abby Jorgensen: Yeah, he's really, I just actually had a Google meet with him earlier this afternoon, just to talk through some of his testing and stuff, but yeah, he did really good.
[00:48:35] Abby Jorgensen: Yeah, his execution actually wasn't that bad.
[00:48:38] Abby Jorgensen: He just really, what did he tell me today?
[00:48:41] Abby Jorgensen: He's like, I'm kind of on the spectrum, so I overthink things a lot, and I'm like, I get it.
[00:48:47] Abby Jorgensen: Yeah, he was confused when the directions say, make the fourth cave your best, but then like all the videos and...
[00:49:00] Abby Jorgensen: Podcasts are like, you know, the last kilometer, you know, execution-wise.
[00:49:05] Gerard Donnelly: that's, that's someone who's attention to details on the, on the spectrum for sure.
[00:49:12] Gerard Donnelly: I was like, well, like I'm the same way from there, but he, yeah, he's good.
[00:49:19] Abby Jorgensen: He sent me, I about, I should have screenshotted it for you, but I.
[00:49:24] Abby Jorgensen: Big improvement on his FTP, was it?
[00:49:26] Gerard Donnelly: Yeah, huge improvement.
[00:49:28] Abby Jorgensen: Well done, Abby.
[00:49:30] Gerard Donnelly: And you coached him through that, uh, testing week, like we talked?
[00:49:35] Gerard Donnelly: Yep.
[00:49:36] Gerard Donnelly: Yep.
[00:49:38] Gerard Donnelly: It's so different when you give them, you know, um.
[00:49:44] Abby Jorgensen: He sent me a message afterwards, uh, like a big thank you to you as a super coach.
[00:49:50] Abby Jorgensen: way I train with you is night and day to how I go about it myself.
[00:49:55] Abby Jorgensen: I'm so excited for what's ahead.
[00:49:58] Abby Jorgensen: So saying So saying that.
[00:50:00] Gerard Donnelly: Send me.
[00:50:01] Gerard Donnelly: Any good messages you get, send them to me.
[00:50:05] Gerard Donnelly: And Jordan can use them for, you know, for promotion, you know, how much our clients are loving, you know, being coached.
[00:50:20] Gerard Donnelly: And it's good for the other coaches, for me to put it in the coach's chat, Abby.
[00:50:27] Gerard Donnelly: You know, people don't go out of their way to say thanks if they don't really mean it.
[00:50:33] Gerard Donnelly: They're just not going to flippantly, you know, send a message.
[00:50:37] Gerard Donnelly: So that's really well done.
[00:50:41] Gerard Donnelly: He, when I interviewed him, I thought he was going to be difficult.
[00:50:44] Gerard Donnelly: I honestly did.
[00:50:46] Abby Jorgensen: Yeah, he's been really, really easy to communicate with.
[00:50:50] Abby Jorgensen: Like, he gave me a hard time the other day, because one time he messaged me, and it was like, I don't know, it was probably like 6.30 in the morning, and I answered him back.
[00:50:59] Abby Jorgensen: And he was like.
[00:51:00] Abby Jorgensen: He's like, what are you doing up at this hour?
[00:51:02] Abby Jorgensen: And I'm like, I don't like, I'm up and I'm going to message you because I had nothing.
[00:51:08] Abby Jorgensen: No, I'm going to message you.
[00:51:10] Gerard Donnelly: Yeah.
[00:51:11] Gerard Donnelly: I care about you, Scott.
[00:51:16] Abby Jorgensen: He was like, when I told him about my shoulder today, he's like, you could have canceled on me.
[00:51:22] Abby Jorgensen: I was like, why?
[00:51:23] Abby Jorgensen: I was like, there's nothing to do about it.
[00:51:31] Gerard Donnelly: All right.
[00:51:32] Gerard Donnelly: That's really, that's really great.
[00:51:34] Gerard Donnelly: And look, he was always worried about him getting too tired.
[00:51:37] Abby Jorgensen: And there was the week of his testing, he felt fatigued.
[00:51:42] Abby Jorgensen: So I switched out a session for him and he was thankful for that.
[00:51:46] Abby Jorgensen: And so, yeah.
[00:51:49] Gerard Donnelly: That's all he will.
[00:51:51] Gerard Donnelly: In the interview, he just wanted to be listened to.
[00:51:54] Gerard Donnelly: That's actually, and he didn't feel like that was happening with his previous experiences.
[00:51:59] Gerard Donnelly: So.
[00:51:59] Gerard Donnelly: So.
[00:51:59] Gerard Donnelly: So.
[00:51:59] Gerard Donnelly: So.
[00:51:59] Gerard Donnelly: go.
[00:52:00] Gerard Donnelly: So he wants to be listened to, and he said, I just train really too hard, and then I lose the plot, and then I don't train at all.
[00:52:07] Gerard Donnelly: That was his thing that he wanted to start.
[00:52:09] Gerard Donnelly: He just wanted to be consistent.
[00:52:11] Gerard Donnelly: So it's not necessarily, you know, he's got great gains already, but, you know, he wasn't actually after that.
[00:52:20] Gerard Donnelly: He just wanted to be consistent.
[00:52:23] Gerard Donnelly: So it's brilliant what you've done.
[00:52:27] Gerard Donnelly: Right.
[00:52:28] Gerard Donnelly: Anything else on him?
[00:52:40] Gerard Donnelly: Someone else is trying to join, don't know why.
[00:52:45] Abby Jorgensen: Oh, it's my, it's my note taker.
[00:52:51] Gerard Donnelly: Just don't let it, there's too many note takers.
[00:52:53] Gerard Donnelly: There's too many note takers.
[00:52:56] Gerard Donnelly: Karen, Karen, back on track?
[00:52:58] Gerard Donnelly: Yeah, she had been sick.
[00:53:00] Gerard Donnelly: Fantastic.
[00:53:01] Abby Jorgensen: Pretty much all of last week, I feel like.
[00:53:05] Abby Jorgensen: So, yeah, just eased her back into training, and then now.
[00:53:11] Gerard Donnelly: Start properly.
[00:53:12] Gerard Donnelly: Yep.
[00:53:13] Gerard Donnelly: Yeah, she's pretty much back to.
[00:53:17] Abby Jorgensen: Good.
[00:53:18] Gerard Donnelly: Happy with that.
[00:53:19] Gerard Donnelly: Yep.
[00:53:21] Gerard Donnelly: Albert?
[00:53:22] Gerard Donnelly: He's good as well.
[00:53:23] Gerard Donnelly: He's testing this week.
[00:53:24] Abby Jorgensen: Yep.
[00:53:26] Abby Jorgensen: But, yeah, other than that, we just moved the run.
[00:53:29] Abby Jorgensen: He moved the run Saturday because he had a Super Bowl party, so he moved it.
[00:53:33] Gerard Donnelly: Good.
[00:53:33] Gerard Donnelly: Yep.
[00:53:34] Gerard Donnelly: That's fine.
[00:53:34] Gerard Donnelly: Yep.
[00:53:35] Gerard Donnelly: Other than that, yeah, he's easy.
[00:53:38] Gerard Donnelly: Bill?
[00:53:39] Gerard Donnelly: Bill's easy as well.
[00:53:42] Abby Jorgensen: I want to think.
[00:53:43] Abby Jorgensen: I was trying to – he doesn't necessarily – sometimes we don't – he doesn't like to run back-to-back, so sometimes it's hard to fit in that fourth run, but he's been feeling great on the run.
[00:53:54] Abby Jorgensen: Like, yesterday, his long run, he hit that 16K, and he's like, I –
[00:54:00] Abby Jorgensen: I was hoping to hit the 14K and he's like, I just felt great.
[00:54:05] Abby Jorgensen: Like everything's clicking for him.
[00:54:07] Gerard Donnelly: Good.
[00:54:08] Gerard Donnelly: And we're just giving him easy runs, aren't we?
[00:54:11] Gerard Donnelly: Yeah.
[00:54:12] Gerard Donnelly: That's terrific.
[00:54:14] Gerard Donnelly: Just say to him to run off the bike, you know, we can make that a short run.
[00:54:19] Gerard Donnelly: Okay.
[00:54:22] Gerard Donnelly: And explain to him that we want to build his running volume.
[00:54:28] Gerard Donnelly: And that fourth run will help him.
[00:54:34] Gerard Donnelly: You know, it'll add another 5K, which that'll make a difference.
[00:54:39] Gerard Donnelly: So, you know, 15, 20 minute run off the bike, you know, especially after he's warmed up, should be fine.
[00:54:46] Gerard Donnelly: And say to him, you know, we just encourage you to get that fourth run.
[00:54:50] Gerard Donnelly: It's going to be really helpful for you.
[00:54:51] Gerard Donnelly: And if he doesn't want to do it, that's fine, Abby.
[00:54:53] Gerard Donnelly: We do, you know, it's like an Achilles issue.
[00:54:56] Abby Jorgensen: So I just don't never want to overdo it.
[00:54:59] Gerard Donnelly: Yep.
[00:55:00] Abby Jorgensen: too much with that okay oh I dreading opening this one actually it's not terrible um has she got everything set up yeah she doesn't have pedals yet but she ordered them or she went to the bike shop yesterday um at least she's doing yeah like it's on erg but like I'm whatever we got it set up so that was the hard part we finally got that working um so yeah that's great Abby you've actually done what no one else could do that's yeah I mean she communicates so much better now that she's back in Australia and not traveling the world and uh yesterday yesterday she she messaged me that she felt something weird in her foot so she just hopped on the gym bike instead um so she said she had broken her foot a while back so um it's the same spot that always kind of like
[00:56:00] Abby Jorgensen: gives her issues, so.
[00:56:01] Abby Jorgensen: Yep.
[00:56:03] Gerard Donnelly: And is she, does she not want to swim on a Monday?
[00:56:07] Gerard Donnelly: Uh, she burned her leg really bad.
[00:56:11] Gerard Donnelly: Yep, okay.
[00:56:11] Gerard Donnelly: Yeah.
[00:56:13] Abby Jorgensen: I just moved it, so.
[00:56:15] Abby Jorgensen: Yep.
[00:56:17] Gerard Donnelly: Yep, okay.
[00:56:18] Gerard Donnelly: Now you got her covered.
[00:56:19] Gerard Donnelly: Well done.
[00:56:19] Gerard Donnelly: Dan?
[00:56:20] Gerard Donnelly: Dan?
[00:56:21] Abby Jorgensen: Good as well.
[00:56:21] Abby Jorgensen: He finally got, my Texas athletes finally can get outside.
[00:56:26] Gerard Donnelly: Terrific.
[00:56:27] Abby Jorgensen: Um, but, I mean, the roads around this time of year get really pothole-y and stuff.
[00:56:34] Abby Jorgensen: Yep.
[00:56:35] Abby Jorgensen: Um, so their rides don't, they aren't as smooth as they would like or we would like, but they're at least getting outside.
[00:56:43] Abby Jorgensen: Um.
[00:56:44] Gerard Donnelly: Yeah.
[00:56:45] Gerard Donnelly: Sorry, it's not falling down.
[00:56:50] Gerard Donnelly: That's a great ride.
[00:56:51] Gerard Donnelly: Jesus.
[00:56:54] Abby Jorgensen: Yeah.
[00:56:55] Abby Jorgensen: mean, it's not terrible, but you can definitely tell that he was avoiding, um, Um, some stuff.
[00:57:00] Gerard Donnelly: So that's good.
[00:57:01] Abby Jorgensen: But we figured out what his issue was.
[00:57:05] Abby Jorgensen: Remember his FTP?
[00:57:06] Abby Jorgensen: Like it went down and he was frustrated.
[00:57:09] Abby Jorgensen: The engineer and him figured out that with the new bike, his crank was shorter.
[00:57:16] Abby Jorgensen: When he changed the crank length and the calibration, it changes the power.
[00:57:22] Abby Jorgensen: It does.
[00:57:23] Gerard Donnelly: Yeah.
[00:57:24] Gerard Donnelly: Yeah.
[00:57:24] Gerard Donnelly: Well done.
[00:57:27] Abby Jorgensen: Yeah.
[00:57:27] Abby Jorgensen: There's always going to be a reason, isn't there?
[00:57:29] Gerard Donnelly: You've to find it.
[00:57:31] Gerard Donnelly: So he's got a sore foot?
[00:57:33] Abby Jorgensen: Oh, he did, but it's, he says it's not bothering him.
[00:57:38] Abby Jorgensen: He's running really well right now.
[00:57:39] Abby Jorgensen: So.
[00:57:40] Abby Jorgensen: Good.
[00:57:40] Gerard Donnelly: Okay.
[00:57:41] Gerard Donnelly: He's got a race soon, hasn't he?
[00:57:43] Gerard Donnelly: He has like a short one and then.
[00:57:45] Gerard Donnelly: It's just in six weeks.
[00:57:47] Gerard Donnelly: Yeah.
[00:57:48] Gerard Donnelly: Good.
[00:57:49] Gerard Donnelly: Are you happy with progress?
[00:57:50] Gerard Donnelly: Everything?
[00:57:51] Gerard Donnelly: Yeah.
[00:57:52] Abby Jorgensen: His thing is just, his is more mental than anything, but I think that he got outside last week and helped a little bit.
[00:58:02] Abby Jorgensen: So we're running him midweek?
[00:58:05] Gerard Donnelly: Yeah, doesn't.
[00:58:07] Abby Jorgensen: Sunday, his wife doesn't like him away for long, so we just need it.
[00:58:12] Gerard Donnelly: That's fine.
[00:58:17] Gerard Donnelly: Yep, well done.
[00:58:19] Gerard Donnelly: That's good.
[00:58:20] Gerard Donnelly: What's happening with Peter?
[00:58:21] Gerard Donnelly: Have you communicated with him?
[00:58:23] Abby Jorgensen: A couple of times, like the house they were going to buy fell through.
[00:58:28] Abby Jorgensen: So, I mean, I, you know, I just kind of checked in and see how he was doing, so.
[00:58:34] Gerard Donnelly: Yeah.
[00:58:35] Gerard Donnelly: I don't know.
[00:58:36] Gerard Donnelly: Has he got, has he got a job back again, or?
[00:58:39] Gerard Donnelly: He hadn't when I talked to him yet.
[00:58:41] Abby Jorgensen: He had possibilities, but he hadn't, like, secured anything.
[00:58:45] Gerard Donnelly: Is he, did you put these up, or did he?
[00:58:47] Gerard Donnelly: No, he did.
[00:58:48] Gerard Donnelly: Yep, okay.
[00:58:49] Gerard Donnelly: So, it's always interesting to me, Abby, when people come off the program and they grab our sessions, which is absolutely fine.
[00:58:58] Gerard Donnelly: Thank you.
[00:58:59] Gerard Donnelly: What sessions?
[00:59:00] Gerard Donnelly: That's always interesting to me.
[00:59:02] Abby Jorgensen: mean, when I talk to him, I try to, like, talk him through, like, he understands the progression, but I was like, hey, like, this is where we're at.
[00:59:14] Gerard Donnelly: Keep communicating, you know, not as in, I want you back on the program.
[00:59:20] Gerard Donnelly: It's just checking in to see how you're doing.
[00:59:23] Gerard Donnelly: That's all you need to text.
[00:59:24] Gerard Donnelly: Yeah.
[00:59:26] Abby Jorgensen: He seems like, yeah, our relationship since that one time, I think, has improved a lot.
[00:59:33] Abby Jorgensen: Yeah, I don't know if he just, you're talking to him or whatever it was.
[00:59:37] Abby Jorgensen: No, he understands that you care.
[00:59:40] Gerard Donnelly: That's, right?
[00:59:41] Gerard Donnelly: He's no dummy.
[00:59:43] Gerard Donnelly: You know, that conversation I had with him was, you know, Abby cares about you.
[00:59:48] Gerard Donnelly: So, you know, bloody trust her.
[00:59:51] Gerard Donnelly: She knows what she's doing.
[00:59:56] Gerard Donnelly: And, yeah, once, as I said, once they trust you, Abby, that...
[01:00:00] Gerard Donnelly: That you're in their corner and you know what you're doing.
[01:00:03] Gerard Donnelly: You know, you've experienced that yourself in your own business.
[01:00:05] Gerard Donnelly: So, yeah.
[01:00:09] Gerard Donnelly: How's Riley going?
[01:00:10] Gerard Donnelly: He's got something coming, hasn't he?
[01:00:12] Gerard Donnelly: He has a half marathon and then Ironman Texas.
[01:00:17] Abby Jorgensen: Oh, a long way, weren't you?
[01:00:18] Gerard Donnelly: Well, not that long.
[01:00:20] Gerard Donnelly: April, but it seems it'll be here before we know it.
[01:00:23] Gerard Donnelly: Are you happy with the way he's going?
[01:00:25] Abby Jorgensen: Yeah, we, so, was it last?
[01:00:28] Abby Jorgensen: Last, not last week.
[01:00:32] Gerard Donnelly: Yeah.
[01:00:33] Gerard Donnelly: Was that last week?
[01:00:34] Gerard Donnelly: That was last week.
[01:00:35] Gerard Donnelly: No, no, sorry.
[01:00:35] Gerard Donnelly: Yeah.
[01:00:36] Gerard Donnelly: Yeah.
[01:00:37] Abby Jorgensen: Thursday he woke up and just, just feeling fatigued.
[01:00:43] Abby Jorgensen: So.
[01:00:43] Gerard Donnelly: Yeah, we've got to be super careful that we don't, don't give that hard day and then, yeah, good.
[01:00:51] Gerard Donnelly: Well done.
[01:00:54] Abby Jorgensen: But yeah, wedding is this weekend, so that throws a little wrench in it.
[01:00:59] Gerard Donnelly: Yeah.
[01:00:59] Gerard Donnelly: got to
[01:01:00] Abby Jorgensen: He said he can do, we're going to try to get an hour FTP outside Thursday, because he's not going to work, because his wedding's coming up.
[01:01:11] Abby Jorgensen: Is he really going to, is he going to try it in the morning of his wedding?
[01:01:13] Abby Jorgensen: He told me he would, because he has people coming over, too, that we're going to run with him.
[01:01:19] Abby Jorgensen: So I was like, all right.
[01:01:22] Abby Jorgensen: And then Sunday, I was like, are you really going to get up and run?
[01:01:25] Abby Jorgensen: He's like, well, just leave it in there for now, and we'll make a decision.
[01:01:30] Abby Jorgensen: And there's no way you're going to get up after the wedding, but we'll see.
[01:01:38] Abby Jorgensen: But other than that, he's, yeah, I think his ride, too, like his road, he said he went out, he drove out to the country.
[01:01:46] Abby Jorgensen: But like he said that there's so many, there were so many trucks in like two lane highway.
[01:01:53] Abby Jorgensen: He just, it wasn't a terrible ride, but like you can definitely tell he was a little, he said he was a little scared out there in the middle.
[01:02:00] Gerard Donnelly: Yes.
[01:02:01] Gerard Donnelly: Two-lane highways out there.
[01:02:04] Abby Jorgensen: That's not good.
[01:02:05] Gerard Donnelly: Yeah.
[01:02:05] Abby Jorgensen: So he said he thinks he found a stretch he can do the FTP on that won't be too bad.
[01:02:14] Abby Jorgensen: That's the issue.
[01:02:15] Abby Jorgensen: In the U.S., you kind of find, like, there's not – they don't leave a lot of room for bikers around here.
[01:02:21] Gerard Donnelly: So it's a struggle.
[01:02:24] Gerard Donnelly: Okay.
[01:02:26] Gerard Donnelly: All right.
[01:02:27] Gerard Donnelly: Well, you got him under control.
[01:02:28] Gerard Donnelly: Well, Erin, has she turned the corner yet?
[01:02:32] Gerard Donnelly: She has.
[01:02:34] Abby Jorgensen: Whew.
[01:02:36] Abby Jorgensen: Yeah.
[01:02:38] Abby Jorgensen: I mean, she executed what – she just – you know, it's not where she used to be.
[01:02:44] Abby Jorgensen: It would be a shock for her, wouldn't it?
[01:02:46] Gerard Donnelly: Yeah.
[01:02:47] Abby Jorgensen: But I think she realizes that – she also says that I think that the jet lag is – or, like, the travel started to hit her fatigue-wise a little bit.
[01:02:56] Abby Jorgensen: Yeah.
[01:02:57] Abby Jorgensen: Which, when you travel to – Which, Which, –
[01:03:00] Abby Jorgensen: All those places, I can imagine, but.
[01:03:03] Gerard Donnelly: All right.
[01:03:04] Gerard Donnelly: But everything seems happy there.
[01:03:07] Gerard Donnelly: Yep.
[01:03:08] Gerard Donnelly: Yep.
[01:03:08] Gerard Donnelly: Motivated and ready to go.
[01:03:11] Abby Jorgensen: Philippe, I mean, he's doing good.
[01:03:16] Abby Jorgensen: What's not loading?
[01:03:19] Gerard Donnelly: There he is.
[01:03:25] Gerard Donnelly: He improved on everything.
[01:03:27] Abby Jorgensen: Everything, yep.
[01:03:28] Abby Jorgensen: A swim in FTP, six watts on the FTP, I believe, and then, I don't know, a minute on the swim.
[01:03:38] Abby Jorgensen: I can't recall off the top of my head.
[01:03:40] Gerard Donnelly: What was his news that he was saying?
[01:03:44] Abby Jorgensen: Oh, the PT said he had a little bit of patellar femoral syndrome, and then the PT didn't want him to bike anything over his current FTP, but he was like, it didn't hurt or bother him.
[01:03:59] Abby Jorgensen: So.
[01:04:00] Abby Jorgensen: So, the bike shouldn't necessarily.
[01:04:10] Gerard Donnelly: Yeah, okay.
[01:04:12] Gerard Donnelly: But.
[01:04:16] Gerard Donnelly: What's he working towards, Abby?
[01:04:19] Abby Jorgensen: Um, uh, half.
[01:04:23] Abby Jorgensen: Yep, Montreal, yep.
[01:04:24] Abby Jorgensen: And then, in this.
[01:04:27] Abby Jorgensen: Montreux Blanc, yep.
[01:04:30] Gerard Donnelly: And then he has another one, too.
[01:04:32] Abby Jorgensen: I don't know.
[01:04:33] Abby Jorgensen: He had them all on the calendar.
[01:04:34] Abby Jorgensen: I have an email of all of that's okay.
[01:04:37] Gerard Donnelly: You happy with how things are going, though?
[01:04:39] Gerard Donnelly: Anything?
[01:04:40] Abby Jorgensen: Yeah, no, he's, he does everything that you want him to do, and then some, so.
[01:04:47] Abby Jorgensen: Awesome.
[01:04:47] Gerard Donnelly: He's good.
[01:04:48] Gerard Donnelly: Mario, the Mexican?
[01:04:50] Abby Jorgensen: Yeah, he, we figured, so, like, let me show you something that's really weird on his FTP.
[01:04:56] Abby Jorgensen: He, we, because when he did.
[01:04:58] Abby Jorgensen: you.
[01:05:00] Abby Jorgensen: So we're right there.
[01:05:01] Abby Jorgensen: Click on that.
[01:05:02] Abby Jorgensen: So it's the same thing.
[01:05:04] Abby Jorgensen: Like, he's so frustrated with this trainer, which I am frustrated with it, too, because if you look at it, yeah, so look at that, but then click on the lap 13.
[01:05:15] Abby Jorgensen: Um, because it gives, if you look, the 20-minute power is different than this lap power.
[01:05:24] Abby Jorgensen: Yeah, 182.
[01:05:26] Abby Jorgensen: 182, but the 20-minute power is 163 if you click on the peak 20.
[01:05:37] Abby Jorgensen: So it must be, we don't, I don't know what, if his Bluetooth is going on on the trainer or what?
[01:05:45] Gerard Donnelly: It's okay here.
[01:05:46] Abby Jorgensen: Yeah, that's why I was, like, I don't, because I was, like, did you stop pedaling?
[01:05:49] Abby Jorgensen: He's, like, no, at no point did I stop pedaling the way it feels.
[01:05:55] Gerard Donnelly: And it started working.
[01:05:56] Gerard Donnelly: Yeah, so, like, I don't, that's why I was, like.
[01:06:01] Gerard Donnelly: Yeah.
[01:06:03] Abby Jorgensen: So I took the 180, the other one.
[01:06:07] Gerard Donnelly: Yeah.
[01:06:08] Gerard Donnelly: And what about the other sessions, Eddie?
[01:06:13] Abby Jorgensen: Same.
[01:06:14] Abby Jorgensen: I mean, same thing.
[01:06:15] Abby Jorgensen: He had similar issues.
[01:06:19] Abby Jorgensen: It drops out here and there.
[01:06:22] Abby Jorgensen: So, like, I told him, like, we had a call.
[01:06:25] Abby Jorgensen: Was that Saturday or Sunday?
[01:06:27] Abby Jorgensen: Saturday?
[01:06:28] Abby Jorgensen: Before I, yeah.
[01:06:29] Abby Jorgensen: Yeah.
[01:06:29] Abby Jorgensen: And, yeah, he doesn't know what.
[01:06:33] Abby Jorgensen: I was like, do you have too many Bluetooth?
[01:06:35] Abby Jorgensen: Because I've heard that's an issue with some people, too many Bluetooths.
[01:06:40] Gerard Donnelly: Yeah.
[01:06:42] Abby Jorgensen: I tried to get him on TrainingPeaks Virtual.
[01:06:44] Abby Jorgensen: So last night, I'm like, actually, he might have texted me.
[01:06:49] Abby Jorgensen: So we're trying that and see if that works.
[01:06:52] Abby Jorgensen: Is he on Zwift, he?
[01:06:54] Gerard Donnelly: I put him on TrainingPeaks Virtual.
[01:06:56] Abby Jorgensen: Yep.
[01:06:57] Abby Jorgensen: He said he didn't have any issues, so he's hoping to...
[01:07:00] Abby Jorgensen: Tomorrow, everything works correctly, so we'll see.
[01:07:14] Abby Jorgensen: It has to be a Bluetooth issue.
[01:07:17] Abby Jorgensen: That's horrible.
[01:07:20] Abby Jorgensen: Because, yeah, he sent me, like, a meme.
[01:07:23] Abby Jorgensen: He's like, I'm about ready to throw my trainer out.
[01:07:30] Gerard Donnelly: But internet in his house must, you know.
[01:07:33] Gerard Donnelly: Yeah, I don't know.
[01:07:34] Abby Jorgensen: Like, he seems like a pretty high tech.
[01:07:36] Abby Jorgensen: I think he works for kind of a tech company, so I don't know.
[01:07:39] Gerard Donnelly: Well, you know, there's another option.
[01:07:40] Gerard Donnelly: could use AMP plus dongle, not use Bluetooth.
[01:07:44] Gerard Donnelly: Okay.
[01:07:45] Gerard Donnelly: Like, I've got, my other laptop's got a little AMP plus that I plug in the side, and I bypass the Bluetooth.
[01:07:52] Gerard Donnelly: Okay.
[01:07:53] Gerard Donnelly: So, if this doesn't work tomorrow, the AMP.
[01:07:56] Gerard Donnelly: AMP plus.
[01:07:57] Gerard Donnelly: It's called AMP plus, and you just have a little, it's a little.
[01:08:00] Gerard Donnelly: A dongle, costs like $30, and it'll sit into your laptop, and you'll have two choices, Bluetooth or AMP Plus, and I just select AMP Plus, and mine doesn't ever go to, I've got good internet now, but I never used to have good internet, I could use Bluetooth if I wanted to, but it used to drop out like that, and it would do my head in, I was like, yeah.
[01:08:30] Gerard Donnelly: I think it's his, I think it's his internet that's doing it.
[01:08:32] Gerard Donnelly: Yeah, I think so, now that I've seen everything.
[01:08:36] Gerard Donnelly: You can say, we just don't have anybody with this issue, we coach hundreds of people, and the only time we see this is there's something wrong with your internet, it's not good enough for us, there's too many other.
[01:08:49] Gerard Donnelly: Other things, yeah, if you have kids, I'm sure, all the iPads and stuff nowadays.
[01:08:54] Gerard Donnelly: Yeah.
[01:08:56] Gerard Donnelly: Where does he do it?
[01:08:56] Gerard Donnelly: Does he do it in a shed?
[01:08:57] Gerard Donnelly: he do it in, you know, a place that's.
[01:09:00] Gerard Donnelly: It's away from the modem.
[01:09:05] Abby Jorgensen: Yeah, the modem, yeah.
[01:09:09] Gerard Donnelly: But he ran okay, did he, with the 5K?
[01:09:13] Abby Jorgensen: Yes.
[01:09:15] Gerard Donnelly: Yeah.
[01:09:16] Gerard Donnelly: Yeah.
[01:09:16] Abby Jorgensen: I was trying to remember off the top of my head.
[01:09:20] Abby Jorgensen: Yeah, I mean, he executed it right.
[01:09:23] Abby Jorgensen: Yeah.
[01:09:27] Gerard Donnelly: You feel that he's on board, Abby, with...
[01:09:30] Gerard Donnelly: Everything?
[01:09:30] Gerard Donnelly: Yeah.
[01:09:31] Abby Jorgensen: I mean, he communicates well.
[01:09:32] Abby Jorgensen: We usually have...
[01:09:33] Abby Jorgensen: I've talked to on the phone, like, three or four times.
[01:09:37] Gerard Donnelly: Yep.
[01:09:37] Gerard Donnelly: Right.
[01:09:38] Gerard Donnelly: Yep.
[01:09:38] Gerard Donnelly: Yeah.
[01:09:39] Gerard Donnelly: Good.
[01:09:39] Gerard Donnelly: And you feel he's progressing?
[01:09:41] Gerard Donnelly: Yeah.
[01:09:42] Gerard Donnelly: I mean, he got...
[01:09:42] Abby Jorgensen: He gets a little frustrated with the swim, but, you know, I kind of got in the right direction of what...
[01:09:49] Abby Jorgensen: And, like, his kid's swim coach is going to help him.
[01:09:54] Abby Jorgensen: Yep.
[01:09:54] Abby Jorgensen: And then I gave him some other tips of some drills to do.
[01:09:59] Gerard Donnelly: So, hopefully...
[01:10:00] Gerard Donnelly: Good.
[01:10:01] Gerard Donnelly: Yep.
[01:10:02] Gerard Donnelly: If he can get himself filmed and send it to Brenton, that's another option.
[01:10:06] Gerard Donnelly: That's what I told him too.
[01:10:08] Gerard Donnelly: So.
[01:10:08] Gerard Donnelly: Yep.
[01:10:09] Gerard Donnelly: How's Glenn doing?
[01:10:11] Gerard Donnelly: He's good.
[01:10:12] Abby Jorgensen: We just did.
[01:10:15] Abby Jorgensen: 60 Minuter?
[01:10:17] Gerard Donnelly: FTP?
[01:10:18] Gerard Donnelly: Did he go all right?
[01:10:19] Gerard Donnelly: No, he did the same.
[01:10:20] Abby Jorgensen: I think he was holding a little fatigue from the past weekend because his heart rate, he just said he couldn't push any more power at the end.
[01:10:28] Abby Jorgensen: And I was like, you might have started too conservative, but he was like, I just couldn't push any more power in your heart.
[01:10:34] Abby Jorgensen: And his heart rate didn't go any higher than normal.
[01:10:37] Abby Jorgensen: I guess it.
[01:10:38] Gerard Donnelly: Yeah.
[01:10:40] Abby Jorgensen: It usually goes to 186, 187, but, but his 60 Minuter was actually decent for the roads.
[01:10:49] Abby Jorgensen: He picked a spot that was a lot of turns, but I mean.
[01:10:55] Gerard Donnelly: That's all right.
[01:10:56] Gerard Donnelly: Yeah.
[01:10:56] Gerard Donnelly: Yeah.
[01:10:57] Abby Jorgensen: His speed is kind of long.
[01:10:59] Abby Jorgensen: So like.
[01:11:00] Abby Jorgensen: That's the thing I have to remind him, like he gets frustrated with numbers, but I was like, last year you were pushing 35Ks, now you're pushing 38Ks.
[01:11:08] Abby Jorgensen: Well done.
[01:11:09] Abby Jorgensen: That's the key.
[01:11:11] Gerard Donnelly: That's terrific, Abby.
[01:11:14] Gerard Donnelly: This section here, where there's no turn.
[01:11:18] Gerard Donnelly: Yeah, I don't know what, I think it was, he said it was a little rougher road.
[01:11:22] Abby Jorgensen: Right.
[01:11:22] Gerard Donnelly: You should have kept going back to there, like where he started.
[01:11:27] Gerard Donnelly: There's no interruptions there.
[01:11:30] Gerard Donnelly: That's what he should have been doing, that whole bit there, and he's going from the shorter bit.
[01:11:36] Abby Jorgensen: It's okay.
[01:11:37] Gerard Donnelly: Yeah, I never like questioned the valley roads, so I'm like, I don't know.
[01:11:43] Gerard Donnelly: It's only three minutes though.
[01:11:44] Abby Jorgensen: That's what I told him, was like, can you have like a five minute area, ten minute area?
[01:11:49] Abby Jorgensen: Yeah.
[01:11:50] Gerard Donnelly: I'll ask him about that stretch.
[01:11:52] Abby Jorgensen: That's the bit he should be doing from there.
[01:11:57] Gerard Donnelly: That's great.
[01:11:59] Gerard Donnelly: I don't I don't know.
[01:11:59] Gerard Donnelly: know.
[01:12:01] Gerard Donnelly: Should have been going up and back there instead of turning.
[01:12:08] Gerard Donnelly: Is there a hill there or something?
[01:12:11] Gerard Donnelly: Oh, maybe.
[01:12:12] Abby Jorgensen: No.
[01:12:13] Abby Jorgensen: I mean.
[01:12:14] Abby Jorgensen: It's not a lot, is it?
[01:12:16] Gerard Donnelly: 16 metres.
[01:12:17] Abby Jorgensen: Glenn's idea of a hill is.
[01:12:23] Gerard Donnelly: That's a really good test.
[01:12:25] Gerard Donnelly: 89 metres.
[01:12:26] Gerard Donnelly: It doesn't matter.
[01:12:27] Gerard Donnelly: We've got hills in races.
[01:12:28] Gerard Donnelly: Yeah.
[01:12:29] Gerard Donnelly: But I was like, it's whatever.
[01:12:31] Gerard Donnelly: And he's not running.
[01:12:33] Gerard Donnelly: Is he running, Abby?
[01:12:34] Gerard Donnelly: Yeah.
[01:12:35] Abby Jorgensen: Something went wrong with his heart rate strap.
[01:12:39] Abby Jorgensen: He said it wasn't like.
[01:12:40] Gerard Donnelly: We didn't test him for a run though?
[01:12:44] Abby Jorgensen: Um, no, because he had just, he'd just done that backyard.
[01:12:49] Abby Jorgensen: And so I think, uh, I was trying to get him to do 6K off the bike, but then he had some issues with the.
[01:12:57] Abby Jorgensen: Yep.
[01:12:58] Gerard Donnelly: He didn't do it.
[01:12:59] Gerard Donnelly: Yep.
[01:13:00] Gerard Donnelly: So he's running there.
[01:13:01] Gerard Donnelly: Okay.
[01:13:02] Gerard Donnelly: And he's got a sprint try.
[01:13:03] Gerard Donnelly: Yeah, that's what I was...
[01:13:05] Abby Jorgensen: Yeah, I forget about that.
[01:13:07] Gerard Donnelly: Using that as kind of a good set for him, too.
[01:13:10] Gerard Donnelly: Good.
[01:13:13] Gerard Donnelly: Oh, he's got the Asian...
[01:13:14] Gerard Donnelly: Yep, okay.
[01:13:15] Gerard Donnelly: All right.
[01:13:16] Gerard Donnelly: Anything else on Glenn?
[01:13:18] Gerard Donnelly: No.
[01:13:21] Gerard Donnelly: How's Pemberton doing?
[01:13:22] Gerard Donnelly: She's good.
[01:13:23] Abby Jorgensen: She improved on all of her...
[01:13:28] Abby Jorgensen: Her FTP by just one...
[01:13:31] Abby Jorgensen: Yep.
[01:13:32] Abby Jorgensen: I mean, she executed it.
[01:13:34] Abby Jorgensen: She felt good about it.
[01:13:35] Gerard Donnelly: Executed it, right?
[01:13:36] Abby Jorgensen: had...
[01:13:42] Gerard Donnelly: I'm to think.
[01:13:47] Gerard Donnelly: She's hovering around that number, isn't she?
[01:13:50] Gerard Donnelly: Yeah.
[01:13:51] Gerard Donnelly: I'm to...
[01:13:55] Abby Jorgensen: Because the last test, she did 194, 197, 199...
[01:14:00] Abby Jorgensen: 9, 2.15.
[01:14:02] Abby Jorgensen: This time she went 200, 201, 204, 2.14.
[01:14:09] Gerard Donnelly: I think she's got to be a bit more risky.
[01:14:12] Gerard Donnelly: More risky, okay.
[01:14:13] Gerard Donnelly: Do you think?
[01:14:15] Abby Jorgensen: I mean...
[01:14:16] Gerard Donnelly: If you can do the last five minutes at 2.14, last two minutes at 2.19, you know, well within her rights to start at that third five minutes, she needs to be pushing that out, you know, from 10 to 15 minutes.
[01:14:34] Gerard Donnelly: Start pushing that at 2.05, 2.06, because she's really doing three...
[01:14:39] Gerard Donnelly: She's doing 15 minutes at 2.01, isn't she?
[01:14:43] Gerard Donnelly: Yeah, basically.
[01:14:45] Abby Jorgensen: 200, 2.01, 2.04, yeah.
[01:14:50] Gerard Donnelly: And then to, you know, she's jumping up 10 watts there, so...
[01:14:56] Gerard Donnelly: There's nothing wrong with that, and...
[01:14:57] Gerard Donnelly: Yeah.
[01:14:58] Gerard Donnelly: It's a really good session, but...
[01:15:00] Gerard Donnelly: I think she's probably, you know, one or two watts better than that.
[01:15:06] Gerard Donnelly: How did she run?
[01:15:07] Abby Jorgensen: I think she was a minute faster.
[01:15:14] Gerard Donnelly: She's broken 50.
[01:15:16] Gerard Donnelly: Well done.
[01:15:17] Gerard Donnelly: Let me look at...
[01:15:19] Abby Jorgensen: Where is that at?
[01:15:20] Abby Jorgensen: First half, 5.07.
[01:15:25] Gerard Donnelly: Second half, 4.52.
[01:15:29] Gerard Donnelly: Wow.
[01:15:29] Gerard Donnelly: That's great.
[01:15:30] Gerard Donnelly: Yeah, she was a 5e.
[01:15:32] Abby Jorgensen: She was 51.49 in January, so now she's 49.55.
[01:15:37] Abby Jorgensen: It's almost two minutes.
[01:15:39] Gerard Donnelly: Yeah, that's terrific.
[01:15:42] Gerard Donnelly: That's a 10K, yeah.
[01:15:44] Gerard Donnelly: And 5K, I reckon she's done a faster 5K.
[01:15:47] Gerard Donnelly: Has she done a 5K test with us?
[01:15:49] Gerard Donnelly: The first...
[01:15:52] Abby Jorgensen: 24.07.
[01:15:54] Gerard Donnelly: Yeah, 25.08.
[01:15:56] Gerard Donnelly: She's run 24.20 in the 10K.
[01:15:59] Gerard Donnelly: So she's...
[01:16:00] Gerard Donnelly: And she's beaten a 5K PB in the second half of a 10K.
[01:16:05] Gerard Donnelly: That's terrific.
[01:16:06] Gerard Donnelly: Yeah, she messaged me.
[01:16:07] Abby Jorgensen: She's like, I'm still improving my run.
[01:16:09] Abby Jorgensen: I was like, did you have doubts?
[01:16:12] Gerard Donnelly: What'd she say?
[01:16:13] Abby Jorgensen: She was like, no, but like, sometimes I think they think that since all they do is easy runs that I don't, you know, they're in Florida for some IVF stuff.
[01:16:26] Abby Jorgensen: Yes.
[01:16:27] Abby Jorgensen: But yeah.
[01:16:30] Abby Jorgensen: Good, Abby.
[01:16:30] Gerard Donnelly: That's good.
[01:16:31] Gerard Donnelly: Good improvement.
[01:16:32] Gerard Donnelly: Well done.
[01:16:34] Gerard Donnelly: Anything else on her?
[01:16:36] Gerard Donnelly: No.
[01:16:38] Abby Jorgensen: We're good there.
[01:16:44] Gerard Donnelly: How far is that one?
[01:16:47] Gerard Donnelly: West Point Triathlon.
[01:16:52] Abby Jorgensen: I mean, I'm pretty sure it's there in Georgia.
[01:16:55] Gerard Donnelly: Chattanooga, yeah.
[01:16:57] Abby Jorgensen: Because she was trying to pick ones that were within driving.
[01:17:01] Gerard Donnelly: Okay, Blair?
[01:17:04] Gerard Donnelly: Blair's doing good.
[01:17:05] Abby Jorgensen: This week he's going back on a ski.
[01:17:08] Abby Jorgensen: He's skiing this week.
[01:17:09] Abby Jorgensen: And then I asked him, I was like, can you run?
[01:17:12] Abby Jorgensen: And he's like, no, we picked the cheapest hotel with nothing.
[01:17:18] Gerard Donnelly: Yep.
[01:17:19] Gerard Donnelly: He has a lot of interruptions, doesn't he?
[01:17:21] Abby Jorgensen: Yeah, but I think he said this would be the last little interruption because he was taking his kids on a ski trip and they have a holiday or something.
[01:17:32] Abby Jorgensen: Has he got any races that he's picked?
[01:17:34] Abby Jorgensen: Not till August, July.
[01:17:39] Abby Jorgensen: Great.
[01:17:39] Abby Jorgensen: Well, it doesn't matter so much.
[01:17:40] Gerard Donnelly: That's for him.
[01:17:41] Gerard Donnelly: Yeah.
[01:17:43] Abby Jorgensen: Otherwise, no worries?
[01:17:45] Gerard Donnelly: Nope, he's good.
[01:17:48] Gerard Donnelly: Michaela?
[01:17:50] Abby Jorgensen: We're just trying to get, so she got leave denied.
[01:17:54] Abby Jorgensen: She can't do the Sydney race because they're short.
[01:18:00] Abby Jorgensen: She on pilot, so all of her leave got denied.
[01:18:04] Abby Jorgensen: So she was also having some fatigue and went to the doctor and her iron's low and B12 and her cortisol is out of whack.
[01:18:13] Abby Jorgensen: mean, which is considering she's a pilot, that makes sense.
[01:18:18] Abby Jorgensen: So the goal is just to get her checking off the boxes and building some fitness.
[01:18:24] Abby Jorgensen: So we had a good long talk and she was frustrated and understandably when you register for a race and can't do it.
[01:18:33] Gerard Donnelly: Is there any other shorter races that she could think about doing?
[01:18:37] Gerard Donnelly: Probably.
[01:18:37] Abby Jorgensen: I just want to get her back into a good headspace, I think.
[01:18:42] Abby Jorgensen: And then she'd even thought about coming to America to do a late season race.
[01:18:47] Abby Jorgensen: So we'll see.
[01:18:50] Gerard Donnelly: Is she living in Australia or New Zealand?
[01:18:53] Gerard Donnelly: New Zealand.
[01:18:54] Gerard Donnelly: Yeah, there must be some short races in New Zealand she could do just for fun, you know?
[01:19:01] Gerard Donnelly: It's February, she's racing February, March, April.
[01:19:05] Gerard Donnelly: So she's got 12 weeks.
[01:19:07] Gerard Donnelly: Find a sprint race for her or a little Olympic.
[01:19:11] Gerard Donnelly: So something fun.
[01:19:13] Abby Jorgensen: And make it like it doesn't, you know, just for some fun.
[01:19:16] Gerard Donnelly: Your training, get some perspective.
[01:19:20] Abby Jorgensen: She bought a gravel bike too, so.
[01:19:28] Gerard Donnelly: Rich, are you going all right?
[01:19:30] Gerard Donnelly: Yep.
[01:19:31] Abby Jorgensen: Besides, I mean, he's up in Seattle for a couple days now, but.
[01:19:34] Gerard Donnelly: Yep.
[01:19:35] Abby Jorgensen: Otherwise, yeah, he's been doing, checks the box pretty consistent.
[01:19:39] Gerard Donnelly: Yep.
[01:19:40] Gerard Donnelly: Has he got anything imminent?
[01:19:44] Abby Jorgensen: Not till, yeah, 10 weeks.
[01:19:47] Abby Jorgensen: That's an Olympic distance.
[01:19:49] Abby Jorgensen: Great.
[01:19:51] Abby Jorgensen: April 26.
[01:19:54] Gerard Donnelly: Right before my birthday.
[01:19:56] Abby Jorgensen: I, uh, I registered for another half.
[01:20:00] Abby Jorgensen: Marathon in the of May.
[01:20:03] Abby Jorgensen: It's called Dam to Des Moines.
[01:20:05] Abby Jorgensen: It's just another pretty wildly run race here.
[01:20:11] Abby Jorgensen: And then I threw my hat in for the New York City Marathon Lottery, but we know how the likelihood of that happening.
[01:20:19] Abby Jorgensen: What date's that?
[01:20:21] Abby Jorgensen: That's November 1st.
[01:20:23] Gerard Donnelly: Okay.
[01:20:24] Gerard Donnelly: But I was like, might as well throw your hat in.
[01:20:27] Gerard Donnelly: Yeah, you're going to know.
[01:20:28] Abby Jorgensen: Yeah, I have a person I know here from Des Moines that does the photography for the New York Marathon.
[01:20:34] Abby Jorgensen: So I would have a place to stay.
[01:20:38] Abby Jorgensen: So I was like, well, it's kind of a bucket list style marathon.
[01:20:44] Gerard Donnelly: Yeah, Yep, that'd be great.
[01:20:47] Gerard Donnelly: All right.
[01:20:48] Gerard Donnelly: You happy with Richard then?
[01:20:48] Gerard Donnelly: Anything to report about him?
[01:20:51] Gerard Donnelly: No, he's, yeah, he's doing good.
[01:20:54] Gerard Donnelly: Yep.
[01:20:55] Gerard Donnelly: Kevin?
[01:20:57] Abby Jorgensen: Yeah, also doing...
[01:20:59] Abby Jorgensen: you.
[01:21:00] Abby Jorgensen: Trying to think where we're at.
[01:21:01] Abby Jorgensen: we testing this week?
[01:21:02] Abby Jorgensen: Yes.
[01:21:03] Abby Jorgensen: Testing this week.
[01:21:06] Abby Jorgensen: But yeah, other than that, his race isn't until July.
[01:21:12] Gerard Donnelly: Yep.
[01:21:15] Gerard Donnelly: 20 weeks.
[01:21:16] Gerard Donnelly: Good.
[01:21:17] Gerard Donnelly: That's a full Ironman, is it?
[01:21:18] Gerard Donnelly: Yeah.
[01:21:23] Gerard Donnelly: I've never heard of Jan Kapi.
[01:21:25] Gerard Donnelly: Where's that?
[01:21:26] Gerard Donnelly: I have no idea.
[01:21:28] Gerard Donnelly: Yeah.
[01:21:29] Abby Jorgensen: My geography is not.
[01:21:33] Gerard Donnelly: So, you're coaching him through his testing week, obviously.
[01:21:38] Abby Jorgensen: He's one that's, you know, that's, I mean, I don't know, 60 or 70 watts since we started.
[01:21:45] Abby Jorgensen: Oh my God.
[01:21:46] Abby Jorgensen: Yep.
[01:21:46] Gerard Donnelly: So.
[01:21:47] Gerard Donnelly: He's one we should be doing a case study on.
[01:21:50] Abby Jorgensen: Yeah, him and, well, he can't run, so that's the only issue really with him.
[01:21:56] Abby Jorgensen: Is he still not running?
[01:21:59] Gerard Donnelly: Are you supposed Are to?
[01:22:00] Abby Jorgensen: I the PT today.
[01:22:01] Abby Jorgensen: Is he going uphill?
[01:22:02] Gerard Donnelly: Is he the guy that's going uphill yet?
[01:22:04] Gerard Donnelly: Yeah.
[01:22:06] Abby Jorgensen: He says it's starting to feel like it feels better when he runs.
[01:22:09] Abby Jorgensen: He's just waiting for the PT to give him the go-ahead, hopefully today or yesterday.
[01:22:16] Abby Jorgensen: Well, today for him.
[01:22:18] Abby Jorgensen: He's asleep right now, I hope.
[01:22:21] Gerard Donnelly: Yeah, okay.
[01:22:26] Gerard Donnelly: Good.
[01:22:27] Gerard Donnelly: All right.
[01:22:27] Gerard Donnelly: Chris?
[01:22:27] Abby Jorgensen: Chris, he just did a, you he's doing, like, I love coaching him.
[01:22:33] Abby Jorgensen: He's so attention to detail and loves the, love how he's feeling.
[01:22:38] Abby Jorgensen: So he did, he tested there, did, I want to say, what if?
[01:22:46] Abby Jorgensen: Yeah, new PB, 227.
[01:22:48] Gerard Donnelly: Yeah.
[01:22:49] Abby Jorgensen: I want to say 15 watts.
[01:22:55] Gerard Donnelly: Six, six watts.
[01:22:57] Gerard Donnelly: Six watts.
[01:22:57] Gerard Donnelly: Yep, then he's, then he's gone out and done.
[01:23:02] Gerard Donnelly: Yeah, just did that today.
[01:23:05] Gerard Donnelly: How did he, this doesn't matter.
[01:23:07] Abby Jorgensen: It was a 2.30, 20 minutes, but he did, his 60 minute was 2.03.
[01:23:15] Gerard Donnelly: Yes.
[01:23:17] Gerard Donnelly: So did he test two weeks in a row, Abby?
[01:23:20] Abby Jorgensen: We moved, so he, we were going to do a 20 minute indoor and then we scheduled a 60 minute outdoor that we moved.
[01:23:28] Abby Jorgensen: He had to move to the day because he uses the Rose Bowl course and there was a giant flea market yesterday, so he couldn't do it yesterday.
[01:23:38] Gerard Donnelly: That is nine watts improvement.
[01:23:40] Gerard Donnelly: That's great.
[01:23:44] Gerard Donnelly: That's really good.
[01:23:45] Gerard Donnelly: So where did he do that 60 minute?
[01:23:49] Abby Jorgensen: He did it today out at the Rose Bowl.
[01:23:52] Abby Jorgensen: So if you scroll down, right there.
[01:23:57] Gerard Donnelly: That's pretty impressive, isn't it?
[01:23:59] Gerard Donnelly: Yeah.
[01:23:59] Gerard Donnelly: Yeah.
[01:24:00] Gerard Donnelly: I was like, you just did more than you did for 20.
[01:24:05] Gerard Donnelly: Yeah.
[01:24:05] Gerard Donnelly: Was the other one indoor?
[01:24:07] Gerard Donnelly: Yeah, the other one was indoor.
[01:24:09] Gerard Donnelly: There's something not right there.
[01:24:10] Gerard Donnelly: He says he rides better outside.
[01:24:14] Abby Jorgensen: But that's...
[01:24:23] Gerard Donnelly: That's a good little circuit, isn't it?
[01:24:25] Gerard Donnelly: Yeah, right around the Rose Bowl.
[01:24:31] Gerard Donnelly: It was.
[01:24:32] Gerard Donnelly: Ten minutes per lap.
[01:24:34] Gerard Donnelly: That's pretty good.
[01:24:35] Gerard Donnelly: Like 184 to 221.
[01:24:37] Abby Jorgensen: Where's his splits?
[01:24:43] Gerard Donnelly: It's pretty good riding.
[01:24:45] Gerard Donnelly: He's finished off super strong.
[01:24:49] Gerard Donnelly: There.
[01:24:50] Gerard Donnelly: That's great.
[01:24:52] Gerard Donnelly: Well done.
[01:24:56] Gerard Donnelly: Interested to hear his comments on that one.
[01:24:58] Gerard Donnelly: It's good.
[01:24:59] Gerard Donnelly: Yeah, no,
[01:25:00] Abby Jorgensen: He was happy with it.
[01:25:02] Abby Jorgensen: He left me a voicemail this morning.
[01:25:04] Abby Jorgensen: Oh, good.
[01:25:05] Gerard Donnelly: Okay.
[01:25:06] Abby Jorgensen: So, yeah, we've already talked about it.
[01:25:07] Abby Jorgensen: And then he has, he has Oceanside.
[01:25:11] Abby Jorgensen: Yes, okay.
[01:25:13] Abby Jorgensen: This week, he is his last little travel bit this week into next week.
[01:25:20] Abby Jorgensen: But then after that, he's like, promise I'm, but he says he's like, there's a reason Oceanside is his B or C race.
[01:25:29] Abby Jorgensen: And then he just told me he's going to do Oregon in, when is that, June or July?
[01:25:37] Gerard Donnelly: I don't know.
[01:25:39] Abby Jorgensen: 70.3 Oregon.
[01:25:41] Abby Jorgensen: I believe it's July.
[01:25:42] Gerard Donnelly: Yep.
[01:25:43] Gerard Donnelly: As is a race.
[01:25:50] Gerard Donnelly: He's a good guy.
[01:25:51] Gerard Donnelly: You like coaching him?
[01:25:52] Gerard Donnelly: Yeah.
[01:25:53] Gerard Donnelly: Yeah.
[01:25:55] Gerard Donnelly: 19th of July, Abby.
[01:25:57] Gerard Donnelly: Okay.
[01:25:57] Gerard Donnelly: Yeah.
[01:25:58] Abby Jorgensen: I'll put that in, I'll Yeah.
[01:26:03] Gerard Donnelly: How do you spell Oregon?
[01:26:08] Abby Jorgensen: That's right, I think.
[01:26:11] Abby Jorgensen: Yeah, that's right.
[01:26:18] Gerard Donnelly: That's actually...
[01:26:19] Gerard Donnelly: Wait, I don't know.
[01:26:21] Gerard Donnelly: It looks wrong, but I'm not the best.
[01:26:28] Abby Jorgensen: Spelling was not my strong suit.
[01:26:31] Gerard Donnelly: Ah, Oregon.
[01:26:33] Gerard Donnelly: Oregon.
[01:26:33] Gerard Donnelly: No.
[01:26:35] Abby Jorgensen: It looks right, but something about it doesn't look right.
[01:26:39] Gerard Donnelly: Oregon.
[01:26:40] Gerard Donnelly: Oregon.
[01:26:41] Abby Jorgensen: Oregon.
[01:26:42] Abby Jorgensen: Whatever.
[01:26:43] Gerard Donnelly: Good.
[01:26:43] Gerard Donnelly: Very good.
[01:26:46] Gerard Donnelly: Scene?
[01:26:47] Abby Jorgensen: He has wisdom teeth out, so we're just...
[01:26:51] Abby Jorgensen: Yeah.
[01:26:53] Abby Jorgensen: A lot of zone two.
[01:26:54] Abby Jorgensen: He tried to run today, and he's like, no, that's a no-go.
[01:26:57] Gerard Donnelly: So, there's been some spikes.
[01:27:00] Abby Jorgensen: And swims for him this week.
[01:27:02] Abby Jorgensen: What's he got happening?
[01:27:06] Abby Jorgensen: Venice.
[01:27:08] Gerard Donnelly: Beautiful.
[01:27:12] Abby Jorgensen: You happy with the way he's going?
[01:27:14] Gerard Donnelly: He's a good trainer, isn't he?
[01:27:15] Gerard Donnelly: Yeah, he's pretty consistent with everything.
[01:27:19] Abby Jorgensen: He did get kind of sick there, which was kind of a bummer, right, in his testing week.
[01:27:24] Gerard Donnelly: He's got a little bit of a last two or three week interruption, hasn't he?
[01:27:28] Gerard Donnelly: Sick.
[01:27:31] Gerard Donnelly: Wisdom teach?
[01:27:32] Gerard Donnelly: Yeah.
[01:27:34] Gerard Donnelly: Okay.
[01:27:35] Abby Jorgensen: Yeah.
[01:27:35] Abby Jorgensen: But other than that, he's good.
[01:27:38] Gerard Donnelly: Easy to communicate with?
[01:27:40] Gerard Donnelly: Yeah.
[01:27:41] Abby Jorgensen: Yep.
[01:27:43] Abby Jorgensen: Andrew's your mate?
[01:27:45] Abby Jorgensen: Yeah, he's in Massachusetts this week.
[01:27:50] Abby Jorgensen: Yep.
[01:27:51] Abby Jorgensen: I don't know.
[01:27:51] Abby Jorgensen: Yeah, he messaged me this morning that he can't get a swim in because his flight's got delayed and everything.
[01:27:57] Abby Jorgensen: So.
[01:27:57] Abby Jorgensen: Yeah.
[01:27:58] Abby Jorgensen: You might have to move things around, have you?
[01:28:00] Abby Jorgensen: Yeah, well, we're fine because he's going to do his run Wednesday because he flies back to Oklahoma.
[01:28:08] Abby Jorgensen: Yeah, he's traveling a whole lot this week, but because of the weather, he wants to run in Oklahoma because it's going to be warmer.
[01:28:16] Gerard Donnelly: Yeah, that'll impact his ride, okay?
[01:28:20] Gerard Donnelly: Okay.
[01:28:21] Gerard Donnelly: So make sure you tell him that.
[01:28:23] Gerard Donnelly: Say, look, it's fine for you to do that, but we wouldn't normally want you to run a 10K prior to your FTP.
[01:28:30] Gerard Donnelly: Because that will pull up soil from that, and then he'll be frustrated if he doesn't ride well.
[01:28:38] Gerard Donnelly: So you're almost better moving the ride, if it's going to be indoor, moving it a few more days back.
[01:28:47] Gerard Donnelly: You know, maybe if you, can he swim any day or does it have to be Sunday, Saturday?
[01:28:52] Gerard Donnelly: He can swim any day.
[01:28:53] Abby Jorgensen: I'm trying to think what, what's his note when does he get back?
[01:28:57] Abby Jorgensen: I think he gets back, right?
[01:28:59] Abby Jorgensen: Bye.
[01:28:59] Abby Jorgensen: Bye.
[01:28:59] Abby Jorgensen: Bye.
[01:29:00] Abby Jorgensen: Okay, Thursday or Friday?
[01:29:02] Gerard Donnelly: Can you swim in Oklahoma too hard?
[01:29:06] Gerard Donnelly: Yeah, I don't think there's...
[01:29:08] Gerard Donnelly: Because the ideal would be to have the swim there, but that's fine to have it there.
[01:29:14] Gerard Donnelly: You can still do the pre-FTP test there.
[01:29:20] Gerard Donnelly: That would be a better scenario.
[01:29:24] Gerard Donnelly: Okay.
[01:29:31] Gerard Donnelly: That would be all right.
[01:29:33] Gerard Donnelly: Now, you tell me if that's not helpful.
[01:29:38] Abby Jorgensen: Travel day might be...
[01:29:40] Abby Jorgensen: What day is he traveling?
[01:29:44] Abby Jorgensen: Travels back on Thursday.
[01:29:49] Gerard Donnelly: So can you do that?
[01:29:50] Gerard Donnelly: I've kept that where it is.
[01:29:53] Abby Jorgensen: Yeah, we can do the swim on Friday and then the bike on Saturday.
[01:29:58] Abby Jorgensen: Yeah.
[01:30:00] Gerard Donnelly: And if he wants to, can ride after the bike if he wants to.
[01:30:04] Gerard Donnelly: I meant to say run after the bike.
[01:30:08] Abby Jorgensen: Yeah, that should be fine.
[01:30:10] Abby Jorgensen: Yeah.
[01:30:11] Abby Jorgensen: I'll just tell him I moved it around just to give him more time to recover.
[01:30:15] Abby Jorgensen: Yeah.
[01:30:16] Abby Jorgensen: Good.
[01:30:16] Gerard Donnelly: Okay.
[01:30:19] Gerard Donnelly: Dougie.
[01:30:21] Gerard Donnelly: He's communicating with me.
[01:30:23] Abby Jorgensen: mean, he did his FTP and he did his swim test and his run.
[01:30:27] Abby Jorgensen: Good.
[01:30:27] Gerard Donnelly: He did.
[01:30:28] Abby Jorgensen: We got all of his tests done.
[01:30:31] Abby Jorgensen: Just can't get him from you.
[01:30:32] Abby Jorgensen: Well, he told me his travel schedule this week was a little.
[01:30:36] Abby Jorgensen: Yeah.
[01:30:37] Abby Jorgensen: He I get back on Friday.
[01:30:39] Abby Jorgensen: Like, he leaves in the morning, travels, and gets home at 7 or 8 at night right now.
[01:30:44] Gerard Donnelly: It's hot.
[01:30:45] Gerard Donnelly: Yeah.
[01:30:45] Abby Jorgensen: So he says next week the travel is over with.
[01:30:49] Abby Jorgensen: So hopefully.
[01:30:52] Abby Jorgensen: I mean, he's communicating all this stuff with me.
[01:30:54] Abby Jorgensen: So we're just trying.
[01:30:56] Abby Jorgensen: That's incredible what he's done.
[01:30:58] Gerard Donnelly: I'm shocked.
[01:30:59] Gerard Donnelly: shocked.
[01:31:00] Gerard Donnelly: to see that's fantastic yeah like his that's like his second best FTP I think I can't remember I know it was like he was shocked as well as how well he he did um it's for his all-time it's like eighth all-time yeah and all those other ones are swift races a lot of them are yeah yeah like last year 252 I mean that's one there's only one other FTP better than that yeah his other 265 is his highest recorded with us yep so 252 is his second best yeah well done oh and that's amazing he's done no training really so yeah yeah it's really amazing but he told me just to throw in some like a bike that runs and
[01:32:00] Abby Jorgensen: And if he gets home in time, he'll do it.
[01:32:03] Gerard Donnelly: And if you think that time's a problem, do this, Abby.
[01:32:07] Gerard Donnelly: Just go in there, get rid of that, make this five minutes.
[01:32:12] Gerard Donnelly: If they see an hour 15 sometimes when they're too stuffed, all of a sudden, if they see 57 minutes, you know, and, you know, I would even go in and do this.
[01:32:24] Gerard Donnelly: I'm just giving you an example.
[01:32:25] Gerard Donnelly: If I've got someone who's struggling with time, I would change so much of the session so that they look at it and go, oh, I can do that.
[01:32:36] Gerard Donnelly: And, of course, you've got to change this.
[01:32:40] Gerard Donnelly: But it's all within, you know, it takes you one minute to do all this.
[01:32:50] Gerard Donnelly: And all of a sudden, you've got a 50-minute training session, you know.
[01:32:57] Gerard Donnelly: And it's kind of doable.
[01:32:59] Gerard Donnelly: And...
[01:33:00] Gerard Donnelly: You just do the same to this.
[01:33:01] Gerard Donnelly: Just get rid of, you know, I'll let you do that.
[01:33:04] Gerard Donnelly: But just cut it all down so that he's got something that, you know, if he sees 30-minute run, I'll go do it.
[01:33:13] Gerard Donnelly: You know, but if he sees an hour, hour six, you know, the difference between an hour six and 50 or even 45, you know, it's doable.
[01:33:23] Gerard Donnelly: That's all we're asking is for him to turn up each day.
[01:33:27] Gerard Donnelly: And you need to say to him, look, something's better than nothing.
[01:33:31] Gerard Donnelly: Even if you didn't even do the warm-up, just did literally five minutes worth of low cadence strength efforts.
[01:33:40] Gerard Donnelly: And then started the, you know, the session.
[01:33:45] Gerard Donnelly: Like there's been a few times where I'm pushed for time and I'm jumping on Zwift and the race starts in four minutes.
[01:33:51] Gerard Donnelly: You know, I just do out of the seat 400-watt efforts for 10 seconds three times and really shock my body.
[01:34:00] Gerard Donnelly: And then start the race.
[01:34:03] Gerard Donnelly: And if I just roll my legs over for four minutes, by the time I start the race, I'm no good.
[01:34:09] Gerard Donnelly: I'm not warmed up enough.
[01:34:11] Gerard Donnelly: So, all right.
[01:34:15] Gerard Donnelly: I think that's everybody.
[01:34:17] Gerard Donnelly: Yep.
[01:34:19] Gerard Donnelly: Well done.
[01:34:20] Gerard Donnelly: I think we're getting more efficient.
[01:34:22] Abby Jorgensen: Yeah.
[01:34:23] Abby Jorgensen: Everybody pretty good last couple of weeks.
[01:34:26] Abby Jorgensen: So, yeah, no, I'm really pleased, Abby.
[01:34:29] Gerard Donnelly: That's, that's great.
[01:34:29] Gerard Donnelly: That's work.
[01:34:30] Gerard Donnelly: Um, I'm just disappointed that there isn't being any more applications, um, uh, that we can throw your way.
[01:34:37] Gerard Donnelly: Yeah.
[01:34:38] Gerard Donnelly: But, uh, now that we've got the, uh, the podcast going again, um, we're going to do one on Riley or what are you guys going to do?
[01:34:48] Gerard Donnelly: We're going to do, uh, Riley's, I would, you know, it would be really helpful is if you just left a voice message on Jordan, mine, and your, uh, uh,
[01:35:00] Gerard Donnelly: If you just summarised your take, just leave a voice message saying this is where he started.
[01:35:09] Gerard Donnelly: Get all his data on your screen and do a summary.
[01:35:13] Gerard Donnelly: Talk about the type of person he is, what drives him, how motivated he is, how consistent he is.
[01:35:20] Gerard Donnelly: Just give a big summary and just pick off some data points of started here, now he's here, started in the run here, started in the ride here, started in Swim and just talk about him as a person and that way Jordan and I don't have to do any research.
[01:35:36] Gerard Donnelly: It's you, you know him, you know him firsthand.
[01:35:41] Gerard Donnelly: And, you know, talk about how much time he has to train and how, you know, how organised he is with work and family and, yeah, just give us all that information if you can.
[01:35:54] Gerard Donnelly: Okay.
[01:35:55] Gerard Donnelly: That would be really helpful.
[01:35:56] Gerard Donnelly: He's your standout, is he, do you think?
[01:35:59] Gerard Donnelly: Yeah, Yeah, between between between
[01:36:00] Abby Jorgensen: Him and Philippe and like Kevin, I mean, from a data situation, like I sent Jordan, like all three of their like data things.
[01:36:13] Abby Jorgensen: I mean, just, yeah, it's hard.
[01:36:17] Abby Jorgensen: Like Riley, in terms of all three disciplines, has covered the most ground.
[01:36:23] Abby Jorgensen: Yeah.
[01:36:25] Gerard Donnelly: Good.
[01:36:26] Gerard Donnelly: Yeah.
[01:36:26] Gerard Donnelly: Anything unique about those three that...
[01:36:30] Gerard Donnelly: I mean, Riley doesn't, I mean, he's obviously getting married.
[01:36:34] Abby Jorgensen: He doesn't have like the family commitments that, well, Kevin doesn't either.
[01:36:39] Abby Jorgensen: Kevin's not even, he was pretty young.
[01:36:44] Abby Jorgensen: I'm trying to remember, does Philippe, he has kids, I think.
[01:36:48] Abby Jorgensen: Yeah.
[01:36:48] Gerard Donnelly: But yeah, they ski a lot, but yeah, he's...
[01:36:53] Gerard Donnelly: Riley's getting married this weekend.
[01:36:56] Gerard Donnelly: Yeah.
[01:36:56] Gerard Donnelly: So that's something we can laugh about.
[01:36:58] Gerard Donnelly: Yeah, I think, I mean, he's...
[01:37:00] Gerard Donnelly: Pretending on training both days, even the morning after he wakes up from his wedding, he's got a meeting session.
[01:37:09] Gerard Donnelly: I mean, I would probably do the same if I was getting married, but I'm not.
[01:37:16] Gerard Donnelly: You want to wake him the next morning after your wedding.
[01:37:19] Abby Jorgensen: Yeah, I mean, his honeymoon's kind of in an awkward spot in March.
[01:37:24] Abby Jorgensen: It's not ideal, but we'll make it happen.
[01:37:30] Gerard Donnelly: But I can just, I can just remember, if Andy woke up the morning after our wedding and she reached over and there's no one there, I've gone training.
[01:37:40] Gerard Donnelly: She would have kicked you out.
[01:37:45] Gerard Donnelly: That's hilarious.
[01:37:46] Abby Jorgensen: At least his future wife is on board.
[01:37:49] Abby Jorgensen: He doesn't really, yeah, doesn't really talk about her much.
[01:37:54] Gerard Donnelly: He has a dog.
[01:37:55] Abby Jorgensen: I know that.
[01:37:56] Abby Jorgensen: Yeah, that's great.
[01:38:00] Abby Jorgensen: He lives in Texas.
[01:38:02] Abby Jorgensen: He's former hockey and lacrosse, I believe.
[01:38:06] Abby Jorgensen: Yeah, they're good things to tell us.
[01:38:08] Gerard Donnelly: You know, he's used to structure and he just applied the same structure to his other sports now into triathlon.
[01:38:16] Gerard Donnelly: Yeah, that's all helpful stuff.
[01:38:18] Gerard Donnelly: Thank you.
[01:38:19] Gerard Donnelly: Yep.
[01:38:22] Gerard Donnelly: Okay, brilliant.
[01:38:24] Gerard Donnelly: I hope you're not in too much pain the next couple of days.
[01:38:28] Gerard Donnelly: Yeah, well, yeah.
[01:38:29] Abby Jorgensen: Yeah, doesn't feel too bad right now if I take my mind off of it.
[01:38:33] Abby Jorgensen: Yeah.
[01:38:34] Gerard Donnelly: But yeah.
[01:38:36] Gerard Donnelly: It should be hard to bother me.
[01:38:39] Gerard Donnelly: Hard to be angry with dogs, isn't it?
[01:38:41] Gerard Donnelly: But geez.
[01:38:42] Abby Jorgensen: I mean, yeah, it's not the first time they've gotten into scuffles.
[01:38:46] Abby Jorgensen: So I know how to handle it now, but it never makes it easy.
[01:38:50] Gerard Donnelly: Yeah.
[01:38:55] Gerard Donnelly: The rawness of food brings out the worst in them, doesn't it?
[01:38:59] Gerard Donnelly: rawness food it?
[01:38:59] Gerard Donnelly: you.
[01:39:00] Abby Jorgensen: Yeah, and I saw it happening.
[01:39:03] Abby Jorgensen: I stepped in, I think, soon enough, but because I stepped in, I got in the middle of it and got the brunt of it.
[01:39:11] Gerard Donnelly: Would they hit each other?
[01:39:14] Abby Jorgensen: Yeah, they would.
[01:39:15] Abby Jorgensen: My 80-pound pit bull, my other two are only 30 and 20 pounds, so if you got a hold of them, it wouldn't be pleasant, that's for sure.
[01:39:28] Abby Jorgensen: So I have to use my strength on the pit bull because they just go into a different mindset.
[01:39:37] Abby Jorgensen: Yeah, they lose their mind, don't they?
[01:39:39] Abby Jorgensen: Yeah, they don't even know what's happening, really.
[01:39:41] Abby Jorgensen: They just go into survival mode, animal survival mode.
[01:39:46] Abby Jorgensen: Yeah.
[01:39:47] Gerard Donnelly: Yeah.
[01:39:49] Abby Jorgensen: Okay, good luck.
[01:39:52] Gerard Donnelly: Thanks.
[01:39:53] Abby Jorgensen: All right, have a good week.
[01:39:55] Gerard Donnelly: You too.
[01:39:56] Gerard Donnelly: Okay, talk soon.
