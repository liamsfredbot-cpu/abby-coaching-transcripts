## Transcript

[00:00:00] Gerard Donnelly: Um, how are you feeling?
[00:00:02] Gerard Donnelly: Pretty good.
[00:00:03] Abby Jorgensen: Yeah.
[00:00:05] Abby Jorgensen: Like I want to do stuff.
[00:00:09] Gerard Donnelly: Body's recovered?
[00:00:10] Abby Jorgensen: Yeah, I feel like it is.
[00:00:16] Gerard Donnelly: Come on, tell me, tell me.
[00:00:19] Abby Jorgensen: Uh, I mean, I've been lifting some weights and I'm more sore from that, I think, actually.
[00:00:25] Abby Jorgensen: Um, but, uh, um, I ran a couple of times this weekend and besides the hot weather that's back, um, I felt good.
[00:00:35] Abby Jorgensen: What did you say?
[00:00:36] Gerard Donnelly: Besides what?
[00:00:37] Abby Jorgensen: The, it's summer again.
[00:00:39] Abby Jorgensen: I got like 98 this, this weekend.
[00:00:42] Abby Jorgensen: So.
[00:00:42] Abby Jorgensen: Yes.
[00:00:43] Gerard Donnelly: Um, uh, I was kind of a little bit shocked that you were doing, um, some strength stuff.
[00:00:52] Gerard Donnelly: Um, mainly just trying to make sure you had a recovery week rather than, um.
[00:01:00] Gerard Donnelly: Yeah, jumping into stuff, so, but anyway.
[00:01:05] Gerard Donnelly: I mean, my upper body did mostly upper body, so.
[00:01:11] Gerard Donnelly: Yeah, your body's used to it.
[00:01:14] Gerard Donnelly: Yeah.
[00:01:17] Gerard Donnelly: Yeah, so what are your thoughts about the race that you've had a week and a bit now to digest everything?
[00:01:27] Gerard Donnelly: Yeah.
[00:01:30] Abby Jorgensen: Yeah, don't know where to go from here in terms of racing, probably won't, like, do any 70.3s till next year because it's pretty much off-season here, I would say.
[00:01:45] Abby Jorgensen: Yeah.
[00:01:48] Abby Jorgensen: Trying to find, like, a marathon or something, but there's not really, we have one here, but it's, we always do, me and my friends always do the, like, a relay, and so I only end up doing, like, 11.
[00:01:59] Abby Jorgensen: 11.
[00:02:00] Abby Jorgensen: Miles of a relay from that.
[00:02:04] Abby Jorgensen: But other than that, yeah, I don't have anything on the horizon.
[00:02:09] Abby Jorgensen: I guess I just want to, you know, work on some weaknesses and get stronger over the winter months.
[00:02:15] Abby Jorgensen: And what are you thinking long term as a triathlete?
[00:02:18] Gerard Donnelly: Are you thinking that 70.3 is your thing or Olympic or?
[00:02:23] Gerard Donnelly: I would say 70.3.
[00:02:26] Abby Jorgensen: Yep.
[00:02:26] Abby Jorgensen: I think a good goal would be able to qualify from an age group standpoint.
[00:02:35] Gerard Donnelly: And that, where is the world after, I mean, look at that next year.
[00:02:43] Gerard Donnelly: After Marbella.
[00:02:45] Gerard Donnelly: I don't even know if they've done that yet.
[00:02:50] Abby Jorgensen: I think they do that, like.
[00:02:53] Gerard Donnelly: I had a feeling that I was reading that they were going to do Nice for the 70.3.
[00:03:01] Gerard Donnelly: Next year.
[00:03:03] Gerard Donnelly: Oh, well, that would...
[00:03:07] Abby Jorgensen: I wonder how they do that course.
[00:03:10] Abby Jorgensen: I know, but...
[00:03:12] Gerard Donnelly: Say that again?
[00:03:13] Gerard Donnelly: Do they do two laps of that course or just one?
[00:03:16] Abby Jorgensen: One big lap.
[00:03:17] Abby Jorgensen: One big lap.
[00:03:18] Abby Jorgensen: They've got a different course for the...
[00:03:22] Gerard Donnelly: And it's similar.
[00:03:23] Gerard Donnelly: They just turned off earlier.
[00:03:28] Gerard Donnelly: That's a course that, you know, where you live is really hard because you need hills.
[00:03:34] Gerard Donnelly: So you would really need to use the trainer a lot more riding hills indoor and still ride your normal outdoor stuff.
[00:03:44] Gerard Donnelly: But we need to get you stronger for courses that have hills.
[00:03:47] Gerard Donnelly: But, you know, that's the World Championships.
[00:03:51] Gerard Donnelly: But other races, you know, you need to try to select races that are similar to the terrain that you've got around where you train.
[00:03:59] Gerard Donnelly: And...
[00:03:59] Gerard Donnelly: .
[00:03:59] Gerard Donnelly: .
[00:03:59] Gerard Donnelly: .
[00:03:59] Gerard Donnelly: .
[00:03:59] Gerard Donnelly: .
[00:04:00] Gerard Donnelly: .
[00:04:00] Gerard Donnelly: .
[00:04:00] Gerard Donnelly: But, you know, that's the beauty of having a smart trainer is being able to, you know, select sessions on courses where you're not loading the Training Peak session onto Zwift or even using Ruby and not using Zwift at all in terms of cost.
[00:04:20] Gerard Donnelly: You know, two apps, it's very expensive.
[00:04:26] Gerard Donnelly: And, you know, which one's going to suit you better?
[00:04:29] Gerard Donnelly: That would be, because I'm experimenting with Ruby right now to see whether it's a better option for triathletes than Zwift.
[00:04:37] Gerard Donnelly: But what we're trying to do is, you know, get to ride courses like Alpe to Zwift and rolling, undulating courses where you can actually practice changing gears like you do outside.
[00:04:47] Gerard Donnelly: And, you know, when you're doing your 70.3 race ready stuff, you're really only dealing with wind.
[00:04:56] Gerard Donnelly: And that's okay, but you're just not getting that...
[00:05:00] Gerard Donnelly: Constant gradient changes, which really affects your legs when you're actually in a race, because you're used to constant pressure.
[00:05:09] Gerard Donnelly: When the pressure's off, on, off, on, and then it's on, then it's off for a bit, that's what you're doing on hills.
[00:05:16] Gerard Donnelly: The body needs to be adapted to what the expectation is on race day.
[00:05:20] Gerard Donnelly: If you've only just got pressure on the pedals all the time, you're not used to that harder, lower, easier, softer, harder, lower cycle.
[00:05:28] Gerard Donnelly: So it does beat you up more.
[00:05:31] Gerard Donnelly: And normally people would really struggle to run after doing a course like that.
[00:05:36] Gerard Donnelly: And it was just fantastic the way you ran.
[00:05:39] Gerard Donnelly: And it just shows you that that constant pressure on the pedals is also good as well, that type of training where you've got no relief.
[00:05:47] Gerard Donnelly: So there's two aspects of what we're trying to do is, one, to get that constant pressure on the pedals so that you can run properly off the bike.
[00:05:53] Gerard Donnelly: And the other one is to get that on, off feeling of changing gears and getting used to it.
[00:05:58] Gerard Donnelly: So, yeah.
[00:06:00] Gerard Donnelly: A lot of the races you should think carefully about, you know, do some races where it really suits you, where it's just flat and fast, and if you want to qualify for the World Championships, try and pick some races that are not like that, the opposite, they're hilly.
[00:06:15] Gerard Donnelly: And, you know, and as a TriVelo athlete, you know, we should be able to handle hills and wind better than any other athletes, and that's, I think that's one of the key things as to why you ran so well compared to the rest of the field, is because you are so well drilled in riding in that range on the bike.
[00:06:37] Gerard Donnelly: So, yeah, I think you should have a really good look at the whole calendar and try to, you know, spend some time really looking at what are the races available to me in my budget, and in my terrain sort of...
[00:07:00] Gerard Donnelly: So, you know, we want to pick races that are close to what we can do in our training.
[00:07:10] Gerard Donnelly: But, you know, wherever the world champs are, like Margaret Bay is really hilly, Abby, and I just think they're kind of going towards that style of world championships now.
[00:07:21] Gerard Donnelly: I think they're thinking about the pros and not really worrying about the age groups.
[00:07:25] Gerard Donnelly: They're just wanting the pro race to be as hard as possible.
[00:07:28] Gerard Donnelly: And the age group is just have to go to that race.
[00:07:32] Gerard Donnelly: So Marbella, there's not one flat bit on it.
[00:07:35] Gerard Donnelly: It's like Nice.
[00:07:40] Gerard Donnelly: It's just such a hilly course.
[00:07:43] Gerard Donnelly: So, yeah, look, I think some local 10Ks and some half marathons would be really good, just some local stuff.
[00:07:52] Gerard Donnelly: If, you know, go into your running calendar for your local area, you know, a lot of the running clubs have events on.
[00:07:59] Gerard Donnelly: They're the things.
[00:08:00] Gerard Donnelly: things.
[00:08:00] Gerard Donnelly: You should be really trying to get yourself into some 10Ks.
[00:08:03] Gerard Donnelly: And I know America doesn't have a lot of park runs, but that's a big thing around the rest of the world is park runs where every Saturday morning, a community run a 5K park run.
[00:08:17] Abby Jorgensen: Just like a run club.
[00:08:19] Abby Jorgensen: There's a run club, several run clubs around Des Moines.
[00:08:22] Abby Jorgensen: Yeah, but these are organized races.
[00:08:24] Gerard Donnelly: These are every Saturday.
[00:08:25] Gerard Donnelly: Yeah, they're not.
[00:08:26] Gerard Donnelly: So they have volunteers, they have finishing times, they have a web page.
[00:08:32] Gerard Donnelly: That's every Saturday.
[00:08:33] Gerard Donnelly: Like in Australia, there's probably, I don't know, 50 park runs going on every Saturday right around the country.
[00:08:41] Gerard Donnelly: And everybody knows at 8 o'clock there's a park run on a Saturday morning and you register.
[00:08:47] Gerard Donnelly: I think it's free.
[00:08:50] Gerard Donnelly: Park runs are free.
[00:08:51] Gerard Donnelly: All the volunteers, you know, if you do a lot of park runs, know, they ask you to do a volunteer as a marshal somewhere.
[00:08:59] Gerard Donnelly: you.
[00:09:02] Gerard Donnelly: So it's an absolutely brilliant thing.
[00:09:05] Gerard Donnelly: And people walk their pushes, they walk their dogs in park runs.
[00:09:09] Gerard Donnelly: It's not meant to be a race.
[00:09:12] Gerard Donnelly: It's just meant to be an opportunity for people to go and exercise.
[00:09:18] Gerard Donnelly: And then there's racing in it for people who want to actually race.
[00:09:21] Gerard Donnelly: So, you know, it used to be just a lot of people just jogging and walking, but now a lot of runners have cottoned on that, hey, this is an actual race that I can, you know, do a time trial, you know, without going into a real race.
[00:09:37] Gerard Donnelly: You know, you have a timing chip.
[00:09:38] Gerard Donnelly: You don't have a pin or number on you.
[00:09:40] Gerard Donnelly: You have a timing chip and they've got a timing there at the start and finish.
[00:09:44] Gerard Donnelly: And as soon as you cross that, they've got really well set up with their statistics to record your time.
[00:09:49] Gerard Donnelly: And it comes up on the webpage.
[00:09:51] Gerard Donnelly: And it's really, that's something that you could, you know, you know, once every eight weeks, you just do a park run or instead of a hard training run.
[00:10:00] Gerard Donnelly: You do that during your week.
[00:10:02] Gerard Donnelly: do your park run.
[00:10:05] Gerard Donnelly: And you still do a long run on the Sunday, you know.
[00:10:09] Gerard Donnelly: So yeah, they're the things I think you should try to look towards.
[00:10:13] Gerard Donnelly: And in the meantime, if you get an athlete like this, Abby, who's really got a long period between autumn, you know, through to winter, back into spring, this is the direction we would want them to take.
[00:10:27] Gerard Donnelly: And we would push the fact that we want them to be super ready during this next four months for the summer season again.
[00:10:35] Gerard Donnelly: This is a great opportunity for them to, I'm talking about you, but you're talking about your coach, great opportunity for you to really, you know, as you said before, work on lots of things, work on your bike, work on your running, work on your swimming, just that's your mindset.
[00:10:50] Gerard Donnelly: I've got this great opportunity to not be specifically doing race ready sessions anymore.
[00:10:55] Gerard Donnelly: I won't go out and have fun on the bike, ride, just ride wherever I can, any course I want.
[00:11:00] Gerard Donnelly: To, you know, providing the weather's okay, or jump indoors and do lots of fun things, but get the endurance into it, that, you know, that strength and endurance into those bike sessions and just build your resilience as a runner, you know, trying to get your long run volume up so that you really, by the time you get back to spring in, you know, six months time, you're a super strong rider and runner.
[00:11:30] Gerard Donnelly: Um, and, and that'll, that'll be a fun summer for you to, and yeah, and just pick, pick a couple of races that really stand out that you, that you want to do.
[00:11:40] Gerard Donnelly: And, you know, it's really expensive to race.
[00:11:43] Gerard Donnelly: So, you know.
[00:11:44] Abby Jorgensen: Like $500 U.S.
[00:11:46] Abby Jorgensen: Yeah.
[00:11:46] Gerard Donnelly: And plus, you know, travel, accommodation, um, you know, it's just, it's a big weekend, isn't it?
[00:11:54] Gerard Donnelly: Mm-hmm.
[00:11:55] Gerard Donnelly: Um, um, so, so we've got to be, you know, we just don't want to be entering all these events.
[00:12:00] Gerard Donnelly: Look, a lot of the races in Australia are getting sold out really early, which is really unusual.
[00:12:06] Gerard Donnelly: That hasn't been happening.
[00:12:08] Gerard Donnelly: You could enter right up until the last week in most races.
[00:12:12] Gerard Donnelly: So just be careful.
[00:12:13] Gerard Donnelly: The races you want to do, you don't get caught out and sold out.
[00:12:16] Gerard Donnelly: We've got Melbourne.
[00:12:17] Gerard Donnelly: Melbourne sold out four months before.
[00:12:20] Gerard Donnelly: It's in November.
[00:12:21] Gerard Donnelly: It was sold out four months before November.
[00:12:25] Gerard Donnelly: And Busso was sold out six months before.
[00:12:29] Gerard Donnelly: But we only have, like, six races for the whole season.
[00:12:36] Gerard Donnelly: So, yeah, but we're a really small population.
[00:12:39] Gerard Donnelly: So I think there's a lot of races available in the States for years to do.
[00:12:44] Abby Jorgensen: Yeah, they moved the Des Moines one to Omaha, which is two hours west.
[00:12:51] Abby Jorgensen: So that might be a possibility.
[00:12:54] Abby Jorgensen: Yeah.
[00:12:56] Gerard Donnelly: Yeah, two hours is nothing.
[00:12:58] Gerard Donnelly: Yeah.
[00:12:59] Gerard Donnelly: Yeah.
[00:13:00] Gerard Donnelly: Yeah.
[00:13:00] Gerard Donnelly: Yeah.
[00:13:00] Gerard Donnelly: Yeah.
[00:13:01] Gerard Donnelly: But in the meantime, yeah, let's just gradually get your structure where you're just ticking off sessions, and keep your strength and conditioning going as you will and do, and just start to do some easy riding and running.
[00:13:20] Gerard Donnelly: That's actually all I want you to do for another week, this week, and have some fun.
[00:13:25] Gerard Donnelly: Don't feel like you're stuck in, I've got to do this in this range.
[00:13:29] Gerard Donnelly: Just ride how you feel and run easy, okay?
[00:13:33] Gerard Donnelly: We're just trying to reintroduce structure into your body so that it gets used to it again without having any, you must be in these ranges.
[00:13:44] Gerard Donnelly: It's just all easy, okay?
[00:13:47] Gerard Donnelly: And don't be restricted.
[00:13:49] Gerard Donnelly: If you feel like riding with someone and running with someone, it's fine.
[00:13:55] Gerard Donnelly: But we're not trying to push it.
[00:13:56] Gerard Donnelly: Remember, you run a marathon, and, you know, before...
[00:14:00] Gerard Donnelly: Like that, rode 112 miles, so you've got to really think carefully about, I'm so motivated because I want to improve, but I need to let myself recover, even though I feel fine, even though my training was so good that I've recovered so well, you've just got to really be careful not to, because in eight weeks' time, you and I don't want to be sitting here going, oh, I'm really flat, I'm really tired, because you've started too soon.
[00:14:29] Gerard Donnelly: You know, I don't mean what we're talking about, this is not starting, this is just getting your body moving again.
[00:14:37] Gerard Donnelly: I mean, when we first start, you know, testing you, and then start doing intervals, that's what I call starting.
[00:14:45] Gerard Donnelly: And that's up to you to tell me that, like, you know, Gerard, for God's sake, I'm ready, or, oh, no, I need another week or two.
[00:14:54] Gerard Donnelly: So, yeah, it's really you telling, and that's what I would say to my athletes, you know, me, if you haven't got something.
[00:15:00] Gerard Donnelly: So that's really happening in the near future, then we don't need to rush this because we've got literally six months to prepare you for next summer.
[00:15:09] Gerard Donnelly: Okay.
[00:15:10] Gerard Donnelly: And the last thing you want to do, Abby, is get the person stale from, you know, from not getting enough recovery from the huge event that you just did.
[00:15:20] Gerard Donnelly: Okay.
[00:15:21] Gerard Donnelly: Yep.
[00:15:21] Gerard Donnelly: Makes sense.
[00:15:21] Abby Jorgensen: I just need structure.
[00:15:23] Abby Jorgensen: That person that needs something.
[00:15:26] Gerard Donnelly: Yep.
[00:15:26] Gerard Donnelly: So I've kind of, it's good you went for a swim.
[00:15:28] Gerard Donnelly: I've just given you a little, a really little program for the week.
[00:15:33] Gerard Donnelly: That's fine.
[00:15:34] Gerard Donnelly: And so if want to swim three times, just keep your swimming going, especially in this, swimming is the best thing to do right now.
[00:15:41] Gerard Donnelly: And, and just some easy rides.
[00:15:43] Gerard Donnelly: If you did, if you did three rides, three swims and three runs, that would be a start this week.
[00:15:48] Gerard Donnelly: And you throw in as much upper body, try not to do too much legwork in the strength and conditioning.
[00:15:55] Gerard Donnelly: Just give your legs a little break from the marathon.
[00:15:57] Gerard Donnelly: I'm sure I'm really worried about people coming back.
[00:16:00] Gerard Donnelly: Too soon from an Ironman marathon, bad enough coming back from just a marathon.
[00:16:05] Gerard Donnelly: You know, you're supposed to have three to four weeks of really not much as a marathon runner.
[00:16:11] Gerard Donnelly: But put that in an Ironman, you know, it could possibly be more than that.
[00:16:15] Gerard Donnelly: So don't get carried away with your running.
[00:16:17] Gerard Donnelly: Your legs just need to absorb that load and you'll be better for it.
[00:16:24] Gerard Donnelly: So be careful with the leg stuff.
[00:16:27] Gerard Donnelly: You're just not going to give it enough chance to recover.
[00:16:31] Gerard Donnelly: So, all right, on that, so I want you, your homework is to really open up all the calendars, running calendars.
[00:16:39] Gerard Donnelly: This is any duathlons.
[00:16:41] Gerard Donnelly: You should be looking for a duathlon that's local, if they have any.
[00:16:47] Gerard Donnelly: That's something that would be really good in winter to, you know, run, ride, run events.
[00:16:53] Gerard Donnelly: And they're quite big in Australia.
[00:16:55] Gerard Donnelly: And it's another really good little, normally they're like five kilometres, 20 kilometres.
[00:17:00] Gerard Donnelly: 20
[00:17:01] Gerard Donnelly: They're really short, sharp races where it's fun.
[00:17:05] Gerard Donnelly: They're just basically fun things to do.
[00:17:08] Abby Jorgensen: Yeah, I don't know if there is any off look.
[00:17:11] Gerard Donnelly: You have to really dig deep because it's not something that people know about.
[00:17:15] Gerard Donnelly: You open up the web page, you know, search duathlon.
[00:17:19] Gerard Donnelly: Oh, I didn't realize they have one hit there or there or there, you know.
[00:17:24] Gerard Donnelly: It's so hard to predict when winter will hit here and then it's stuck inside.
[00:17:30] Gerard Donnelly: Yeah, you literally can't run on the ice, can you?
[00:17:34] Gerard Donnelly: No.
[00:17:35] Abby Jorgensen: I mean, sometimes it just snows, but still it can get pretty deep.
[00:17:40] Abby Jorgensen: There's a lot of snow all at once.
[00:17:42] Gerard Donnelly: Yeah, so it's unlikely that in the middle of December and January you're going to have much opportunity to be outside.
[00:17:48] Abby Jorgensen: Yeah, I mean, we might get lucky, but it's hard to tell.
[00:17:52] Abby Jorgensen: Yeah, but you've got, have you got any access to a treadmill, Abby?
[00:17:57] Gerard Donnelly: Yeah, I have my own treadmill.
[00:18:00] Gerard Donnelly: Awesome.
[00:18:00] Gerard Donnelly: So you've got your own studio there.
[00:18:02] Gerard Donnelly: That's great.
[00:18:03] Gerard Donnelly: Yeah.
[00:18:04] Gerard Donnelly: Yeah, fantastic.
[00:18:06] Gerard Donnelly: Anything on yourself?
[00:18:07] Gerard Donnelly: Anything else?
[00:18:09] Gerard Donnelly: No, just, yeah, I don't know.
[00:18:11] Abby Jorgensen: I'm just trying to enjoy my last week off of not doing a whole lot of anything.
[00:18:18] Gerard Donnelly: Yeah, you start your job next week?
[00:18:19] Abby Jorgensen: Yeah, I don't know what my exact schedule will be, but it'll be probably pretty chill to start with.
[00:18:27] Abby Jorgensen: Yep.
[00:18:27] Gerard Donnelly: Great.
[00:18:28] Gerard Donnelly: Well, we'll just keep working on getting you more athletes.
[00:18:31] Gerard Donnelly: So we might as well start with Michael Abernathy.
[00:18:36] Gerard Donnelly: He hasn't done anything.
[00:18:39] Gerard Donnelly: Have you had a conversation with him?
[00:18:41] Gerard Donnelly: No, because I haven't got his athlete profile.
[00:18:44] Abby Jorgensen: I haven't got anything yet.
[00:18:46] Abby Jorgensen: He hasn't done it.
[00:18:48] Gerard Donnelly: He's not on Training Peaks.
[00:18:50] Gerard Donnelly: He hasn't signed his athlete profile form.
[00:18:52] Gerard Donnelly: He hasn't set up his direct debit.
[00:18:53] Gerard Donnelly: He hasn't signed a waiver.
[00:18:56] Gerard Donnelly: Um, so I need to reach out to him.
[00:19:01] Abby Jorgensen: Yeah, Foyden sent some email this morning because he was questioning aero bars for his bike.
[00:19:08] Abby Jorgensen: don't know if he got that.
[00:19:10] Gerard Donnelly: Yep, I saw that this morning too.
[00:19:12] Gerard Donnelly: And I have no idea.
[00:19:16] Gerard Donnelly: I just needed to find from you, what you had in contact with him, that was all.
[00:19:21] Abby Jorgensen: No, yeah, I haven't seen anything come through.
[00:19:29] Gerard Donnelly: Okay, so that's Michael.
[00:19:39] Gerard Donnelly: I think that was all new people.
[00:19:47] Gerard Donnelly: I'm just looking at the list of applicants.
[00:19:53] Gerard Donnelly: Be with me.
[00:20:00] Gerard Donnelly: Yeah, there's a couple more interviews I've got this week.
[00:20:03] Gerard Donnelly: So let's see what that looks like.
[00:20:10] Gerard Donnelly: So Cindy looks like she's injured.
[00:20:14] Gerard Donnelly: Did you?
[00:20:16] Abby Jorgensen: Yeah, we've had a couple of talks kind of going back and forth.
[00:20:20] Abby Jorgensen: I mean, I forgot she was going to France.
[00:20:22] Abby Jorgensen: So that kind of makes her decision, I think, made her decision easier.
[00:20:29] Gerard Donnelly: Yeah, she just sent me an email this morning, which I forwarded to you.
[00:20:33] Gerard Donnelly: Yeah, she asked for your email.
[00:20:37] Gerard Donnelly: So we'll put her on pause, which is annoying for you when we're trying to grow your business.
[00:20:46] Gerard Donnelly: It's hilarious, isn't it?
[00:20:47] Gerard Donnelly: One step forward, two steps back.
[00:20:53] Abby Jorgensen: Yeah, I'm curious of how that even, I mean, wonder if she had that before she even started, if it's something that just re-
[00:21:00] Abby Jorgensen: Aggravated.
[00:21:01] Abby Jorgensen: I don't know.
[00:21:01] Abby Jorgensen: It's hard to tell.
[00:21:03] Gerard Donnelly: Abby, why does she do that?
[00:21:05] Gerard Donnelly: Why does she walk that race?
[00:21:07] Gerard Donnelly: Like, that's what's caused it.
[00:21:12] Abby Jorgensen: Yeah, I mean, I'm like, she just was like, I'm determined I need to try this out.
[00:21:18] Abby Jorgensen: And I was like, all right, well, if you're already hurt, like, why don't you just do the bike and the swim?
[00:21:24] Abby Jorgensen: And she thought about it.
[00:21:25] Abby Jorgensen: She's like, I could just swim and then bike.
[00:21:27] Abby Jorgensen: I'm like, yeah, like, that would be the smart thing to do.
[00:21:31] Gerard Donnelly: But.
[00:21:31] Gerard Donnelly: No, you have to be more strict.
[00:21:33] Gerard Donnelly: You know, you have to say, in our opinion, you should not be running.
[00:21:39] Gerard Donnelly: We just had the Sunshine Coast, Ben Morgan, who's one of our top athletes, strained his calf a little bit on Tuesday and thought he'd be okay.
[00:21:49] Gerard Donnelly: And I said, no way.
[00:21:51] Gerard Donnelly: He'd already flown, you know, 2,000 kilometers to the event and accommodation and everything.
[00:21:58] Gerard Donnelly: I said, no, you can only swim and ride.
[00:22:00] Gerard Donnelly: Ben, you can't run.
[00:22:03] Gerard Donnelly: That will ruin the rest of your season.
[00:22:07] Gerard Donnelly: You'll be injured.
[00:22:08] Gerard Donnelly: A calf will be four to six weeks.
[00:22:10] Gerard Donnelly: If you run, you'll do it again.
[00:22:13] Gerard Donnelly: And he was so disappointed.
[00:22:16] Gerard Donnelly: But I said to him, no, we have to change your mindset.
[00:22:19] Gerard Donnelly: Do the best swim and the best ride you can possibly do.
[00:22:21] Gerard Donnelly: And concentrate on your numbers.
[00:22:25] Gerard Donnelly: And we switched it around.
[00:22:28] Gerard Donnelly: And I had Laura, who lives in London, and she was going to do the Berlin 70.3.
[00:22:39] Gerard Donnelly: And I had to make her swim and ride.
[00:22:42] Gerard Donnelly: No run.
[00:22:43] Gerard Donnelly: You know, and a tough call as a coach.
[00:22:46] Gerard Donnelly: Because, you know, you don't want to disappoint them.
[00:22:48] Gerard Donnelly: But that's what they've got you for, is to put your foot down and say, in our opinion, you shouldn't be running.
[00:22:54] Gerard Donnelly: You know, and this is the reason why.
[00:22:57] Gerard Donnelly: Because you will be injured after this.
[00:23:00] Gerard Donnelly: And it will
[00:23:00] Gerard Donnelly: Derail your whole, you know, your whole next six months, possibly.
[00:23:07] Gerard Donnelly: And so she's gone ahead and she pretty much walked around, didn't she, for that?
[00:23:11] Gerard Donnelly: How long was she out there for?
[00:23:14] Abby Jorgensen: She said she walked, but...
[00:23:16] Abby Jorgensen: It's just so silly.
[00:23:18] Gerard Donnelly: What was the purpose of, you know...
[00:23:22] Gerard Donnelly: I don't understand what the purpose was.
[00:23:26] Gerard Donnelly: It was, yeah, I think...
[00:23:30] Gerard Donnelly: Three and a half hours?
[00:23:32] Gerard Donnelly: Yeah, I think that's...
[00:23:36] Gerard Donnelly: Who goes for a three and a half hour walk after they've done a swim and ride, you know?
[00:23:43] Gerard Donnelly: It's just so silly.
[00:23:47] Gerard Donnelly: I throw my hands in the air going, well, what do you think was going to happen?
[00:23:51] Gerard Donnelly: You're going to be sore from that.
[00:23:53] Gerard Donnelly: If you just went for a three and a half hour walk...
[00:23:56] Gerard Donnelly: Well, thank you.
[00:23:59] Abby Jorgensen: It doesn't even sound fun.
[00:24:01] Abby Jorgensen: Yeah.
[00:24:04] Gerard Donnelly: So a good lesson here is, you know, Andrew's the same with his injury.
[00:24:10] Gerard Donnelly: You know, he's just left me a voice message saying that he's keen to push on.
[00:24:15] Gerard Donnelly: Is that the conversation you've had?
[00:24:17] Gerard Donnelly: Yeah, he says he feels a lot better.
[00:24:20] Abby Jorgensen: So we're just kind of taking it day by day.
[00:24:24] Gerard Donnelly: Yeah.
[00:24:26] Gerard Donnelly: He has to decide by Wednesday, doesn't he?
[00:24:28] Gerard Donnelly: Yeah.
[00:24:30] Gerard Donnelly: Yeah.
[00:24:30] Abby Jorgensen: He needs to swim still and figure out how that feels.
[00:24:34] Abby Jorgensen: But he said the day felt really good.
[00:24:36] Abby Jorgensen: What's his injury again?
[00:24:37] Gerard Donnelly: Abby, just remind me.
[00:24:39] Abby Jorgensen: Well, he crashed and he says it's more like he was afraid it was ribs, but he doesn't think it's his ribs.
[00:24:49] Abby Jorgensen: And he said he had a little bit of pain in his back.
[00:24:53] Abby Jorgensen: But other than that, he was just.
[00:24:57] Abby Jorgensen: I mean, he's lucky that he wasn't hurt worse.
[00:25:00] Gerard Donnelly: Thank you.
[00:25:00] Gerard Donnelly: Can you tell me when he did this and what actually happened?
[00:25:05] Gerard Donnelly: Right there, that 30th.
[00:25:09] Abby Jorgensen: 30th, here?
[00:25:10] Gerard Donnelly: Yeah.
[00:25:13] Gerard Donnelly: Okay, so can you tell me he crashed, and how did he crash?
[00:25:18] Abby Jorgensen: it was the next, hold on, it was the sixth.
[00:25:21] Gerard Donnelly: Okay, I'll just write that down a little bit.
[00:25:26] Gerard Donnelly: The sixth, all right.
[00:25:35] Gerard Donnelly: So how did he crash?
[00:25:38] Abby Jorgensen: He said he was reaching for a gel, and just kind of swerved, and then went off into the, like the shoulder, the shoulder in the ditch, so he fell in the, like, the grass area in a ditch.
[00:25:51] Abby Jorgensen: Yeah.
[00:25:52] Abby Jorgensen: Over his handlebars.
[00:25:54] Gerard Donnelly: Yeah, and did he go to emergency?
[00:25:57] Abby Jorgensen: Yeah, his wife's a nurse, so she took him in.
[00:26:00] Abby Jorgensen: And he's got really sore ribs still.
[00:26:04] Gerard Donnelly: His ribs aren't sore anymore.
[00:26:05] Abby Jorgensen: It's more, he said, like last week his back hurt a little bit, but today he said, like, everything seems to be better.
[00:26:14] Abby Jorgensen: They didn't see anything on x-ray.
[00:26:17] Abby Jorgensen: Okay, so he had an x-ray.
[00:26:18] Gerard Donnelly: Okay.
[00:26:20] Gerard Donnelly: So no broken bone is more muscular by the sound of it.
[00:26:23] Gerard Donnelly: Yeah.
[00:26:25] Gerard Donnelly: How many weeks is the LMA?
[00:26:29] Gerard Donnelly: Six weeks.
[00:26:35] Gerard Donnelly: His message to me was he wants to push on.
[00:26:41] Gerard Donnelly: Is that right?
[00:26:43] Gerard Donnelly: Yeah, that's what he told me this morning.
[00:26:45] Abby Jorgensen: When he finished his bike and run today, he said everything felt good.
[00:26:50] Abby Jorgensen: Yeah, okay.
[00:26:51] Gerard Donnelly: All right.
[00:26:52] Gerard Donnelly: Yeah.
[00:26:53] Abby Jorgensen: And he rode a couple hours on last Saturday or Sunday.
[00:26:58] Abby Jorgensen: Yeah.
[00:26:59] Abby Jorgensen: He said, he said, no.
[00:27:00] Gerard Donnelly: Felt fine.
[00:27:01] Gerard Donnelly: There was no pain in the morning, so.
[00:27:06] Gerard Donnelly: He rode indoor?
[00:27:07] Gerard Donnelly: Great.
[00:27:08] Abby Jorgensen: Yeah, he's kind of scared to go out right now, and I was like, well, baby steps in your neighborhood, and then go for it.
[00:27:15] Gerard Donnelly: Yeah.
[00:27:21] Gerard Donnelly: So would you think he's going to be doing that long ride indoors or outdoors?
[00:27:28] Abby Jorgensen: I don't know yet.
[00:27:29] Abby Jorgensen: Depends on how he's feeling.
[00:27:31] Abby Jorgensen: Like, psychologically, I think it's more psychologically than anything.
[00:27:37] Abby Jorgensen: That's why I think I lowered it to one.
[00:27:41] Abby Jorgensen: I think I lowered it to 120.
[00:27:48] Gerard Donnelly: Where does he live?
[00:27:50] Gerard Donnelly: Fort Wayne, Indiana.
[00:27:54] Gerard Donnelly: I've always got to find out where I'm looking.
[00:28:05] Gerard Donnelly: So he's got a reasonably good circuit, by the look of it?
[00:28:08] Abby Jorgensen: Yeah.
[00:28:09] Abby Jorgensen: That's one of the more windy ones that he does.
[00:28:14] Abby Jorgensen: He sometimes has a pretty straight one that he does as well.
[00:28:17] Gerard Donnelly: Well, Florida's pancake flat, but that's good that he's doing that.
[00:28:27] Abby Jorgensen: So maybe I should do a Florida one if it's pancake flat.
[00:28:32] Gerard Donnelly: It's pancake flat.
[00:28:36] Gerard Donnelly: I would be encouraging him, Abby, to get outside this weekend, as long as he's healthy and comfortable.
[00:28:44] Gerard Donnelly: That would be something.
[00:28:50] Gerard Donnelly: And I think you're wanting to say, look, 120 is the minimum.
[00:28:58] Gerard Donnelly: If you're outside, if you could do 100...
[00:29:00] Gerard Donnelly: 40.
[00:29:02] Gerard Donnelly: If he's fully recovered and he's ready to train, then I think you'd need to push him to that.
[00:29:08] Gerard Donnelly: But if he's still struggling a bit, then what you've given him is absolutely fine.
[00:29:14] Gerard Donnelly: But remember, we've only got six weeks.
[00:29:18] Gerard Donnelly: And look, you just think about your experience.
[00:29:22] Gerard Donnelly: Do you wish you did more longer rides?
[00:29:24] Gerard Donnelly: Probably.
[00:29:25] Gerard Donnelly: And this is the time to be doing it.
[00:29:27] Gerard Donnelly: You know, what's it like?
[00:29:30] Gerard Donnelly: You you'd think about your program, you were doing with your runs.
[00:29:33] Gerard Donnelly: You know, those long runs off the bike and, you know, those long Sunday runs.
[00:29:40] Gerard Donnelly: You know, can you think about what he's going to run in terms of time?
[00:29:47] Gerard Donnelly: Is he a four hour, 4.20, 3.50?
[00:29:50] Gerard Donnelly: No, he'd probably be closer to a five hour.
[00:29:53] Abby Jorgensen: Five hours.
[00:29:54] Gerard Donnelly: 4.35.
[00:29:56] Gerard Donnelly: Yep.
[00:29:56] Gerard Donnelly: So, you know, we've really got to get him, if he's, again, if
[00:30:00] Gerard Donnelly: He's healthy.
[00:30:01] Gerard Donnelly: The mid-week run has to be, you know, 90 minutes, easy recovery Tuesday, really long double day on Sunday where he's running in the morning, running in afternoon.
[00:30:13] Gerard Donnelly: So we've got to get his running up.
[00:30:16] Gerard Donnelly: And obviously when he crashed, that's hard.
[00:30:21] Gerard Donnelly: We had.
[00:30:22] Gerard Donnelly: Oh, that's great.
[00:30:23] Gerard Donnelly: 70, 30, 50.
[00:30:27] Gerard Donnelly: That's great.
[00:30:28] Gerard Donnelly: 50.
[00:30:29] Gerard Donnelly: Fantastic.
[00:30:29] Gerard Donnelly: Yep.
[00:30:30] Gerard Donnelly: you just keep along those lines.
[00:30:33] Gerard Donnelly: So the one, you know, there's mid-week stuff.
[00:30:35] Gerard Donnelly: This is really good.
[00:30:36] Gerard Donnelly: Just keep doing that stuff.
[00:30:38] Gerard Donnelly: Okay.
[00:30:40] Gerard Donnelly: Trying to ease up.
[00:30:43] Gerard Donnelly: Yep.
[00:30:43] Gerard Donnelly: Your theory here is correct.
[00:30:45] Gerard Donnelly: That's really good.
[00:30:46] Gerard Donnelly: But next week you have to really step it up a bit.
[00:30:50] Gerard Donnelly: Because really it's only four more weeks.
[00:30:52] Gerard Donnelly: One, two, three, four, five, six.
[00:30:57] Gerard Donnelly: Okay.
[00:30:57] Gerard Donnelly: So that makes me feel, breathe a little bit easier.
[00:31:00] Gerard Donnelly: Okay.
[00:31:01] Gerard Donnelly: Okay.
[00:31:05] Gerard Donnelly: Anybody that's – Kevin, how's Kevin going?
[00:31:08] Gerard Donnelly: He's new?
[00:31:09] Abby Jorgensen: Yeah, he's in Denmark right now.
[00:31:14] Abby Jorgensen: Yep.
[00:31:15] Abby Jorgensen: So, yeah, before he left, he did his swim time trial, and then he got the trainer set up.
[00:31:25] Abby Jorgensen: But he was waiting on his crank to get here, and it should be here when he gets home this week.
[00:31:31] Gerard Donnelly: Yeah.
[00:31:33] Gerard Donnelly: So he seems like he started okay?
[00:31:35] Abby Jorgensen: You're happy with – Yeah, he really communicates well.
[00:31:39] Abby Jorgensen: Yep.
[00:31:40] Abby Jorgensen: Messaged me today because the pool doesn't open until Wednesday, so I switched some things around for him.
[00:31:46] Abby Jorgensen: Good.
[00:31:47] Abby Jorgensen: Yeah.
[00:31:49] Gerard Donnelly: That's great, Abby.
[00:31:50] Gerard Donnelly: And he can't run, so just keep pushing his rides.
[00:31:54] Gerard Donnelly: Mm-hmm.
[00:31:55] Gerard Donnelly: Get that test done.
[00:31:56] Gerard Donnelly: That's great.
[00:31:57] Gerard Donnelly: And then, hopefully, Frank gets there by the time he's home, he said.
[00:32:01] Abby Jorgensen: And if it doesn't, just move it.
[00:32:03] Gerard Donnelly: Don't test him until he's got everything.
[00:32:07] Gerard Donnelly: And the key thing is just to remind him that we, I'm happy for him to have, because he's, is he on Zwift?
[00:32:13] Gerard Donnelly: Yeah, he's on Zwift.
[00:32:15] Abby Jorgensen: Oh, yeah, he went ahead and did that because he was like, what, what's the easiest way to like, have something?
[00:32:21] Gerard Donnelly: And I was like, well, Zwift or something.
[00:32:24] Gerard Donnelly: Yeah.
[00:32:24] Gerard Donnelly: So make sure that he's not using the kicker power meter.
[00:32:27] Gerard Donnelly: That's, you know, if he wants to have the kicker power meter through the Zwift screen and then have his bike power meter through his bike computer to have two files loaded, that would be fine for the first test.
[00:32:39] Gerard Donnelly: You know how to explain that to them.
[00:32:42] Gerard Donnelly: But, but we just got to make sure he's on a road bike.
[00:32:46] Gerard Donnelly: So, yeah, just say, we don't want you to stand up.
[00:32:49] Gerard Donnelly: We just want you to be kind of a little bit aero position and make sure we've got to have your bike power meter on your, you know, on your bike computer.
[00:32:59] Gerard Donnelly: That's the result we want.
[00:33:00] Gerard Donnelly: We want to.
[00:33:01] Gerard Donnelly: We don't want to have the pick-up power number.
[00:33:05] Gerard Donnelly: We could have it just to see if there's a difference.
[00:33:08] Gerard Donnelly: That would be really good to have.
[00:33:10] Gerard Donnelly: Yeah.
[00:33:13] Gerard Donnelly: Okay.
[00:33:16] Abby Jorgensen: Mikayla is coming up this week.
[00:33:20] Abby Jorgensen: Is that again?
[00:33:21] Abby Jorgensen: Mikayla.
[00:33:22] Gerard Donnelly: Mikayla, yeah.
[00:33:23] Abby Jorgensen: Her race in Western Sydney.
[00:33:26] Abby Jorgensen: Yeah.
[00:33:29] Abby Jorgensen: Any tips for Western Sydney, like that course?
[00:33:33] Gerard Donnelly: Then pancake flat.
[00:33:35] Gerard Donnelly: Okay.
[00:33:36] Gerard Donnelly: That's really good.
[00:33:37] Gerard Donnelly: And it's got basically sections where you just go out, Abby, and back, out and back.
[00:33:42] Gerard Donnelly: So it just turns.
[00:33:44] Gerard Donnelly: So it's really good because you get a chance to see what your power is.
[00:33:53] Gerard Donnelly: So, you know, come out of the corner, push lap, get into the TT position.
[00:33:57] Gerard Donnelly: Go around the turn at the other end of the course.
[00:34:00] Gerard Donnelly: Come out of the corner.
[00:34:00] Gerard Donnelly: out the corner.
[00:34:00] Gerard Donnelly: So Thank
[00:34:01] Gerard Donnelly: Get in the TT position, push lap, you know, so you can forget about the turn, you know, the power you're going to lose in the turn.
[00:34:09] Gerard Donnelly: So everything's flat, and it's, yeah, kind of a fast course, and depending on the wind on the day, it would just be you giving her advice on, hey, Michaela, what's the wind today?
[00:34:29] Gerard Donnelly: And it's really important, Abby, you go into that webpage, the Western Sydney 70.3 webpage, and you look at the course, and I think we've got a video that we'll send out later in the week, but it's really important that you're across the course, okay?
[00:34:53] Abby Jorgensen: Yep, I think I've already opened it up a couple times when I was talking to her, so.
[00:34:59] Gerard Donnelly: Yep.
[00:35:02] Gerard Donnelly: I'm just gonna open it up while I'm here myself.
[00:35:10] Gerard Donnelly: Yeah so, so pretty much, the course goes north-south and it's got so many turns, that's the part of...
[00:35:33] Gerard Donnelly: Sorry, I'm just trying to share.
[00:35:38] Abby Jorgensen: Yeah, it's alright, I was trying to pull it up as well.
[00:35:46] Gerard Donnelly: Can you see?
[00:35:52] Gerard Donnelly: Yeah.
[00:35:59] Gerard Donnelly: So...
[00:36:01] Gerard Donnelly: So when you sort of get on it, it's like, it runs north-south, so really the wind's going to have a big factor.
[00:36:11] Gerard Donnelly: Is the wind north-south there usually, or is it east Yeah, it comes normally from this direction, from the east, and then from the south-south-east.
[00:36:26] Gerard Donnelly: They're the prevailing winds.
[00:36:29] Gerard Donnelly: But, you know, I say that about Melbourne, we always have south-westerlies, and then every race is an orderly, every race.
[00:36:37] Gerard Donnelly: It's just, it's just not the wind that we're used to having on race day, it's an orderly.
[00:36:42] Gerard Donnelly: And so, yeah, so look, there's very little gradient.
[00:36:49] Gerard Donnelly: It's 200 metres, which is like 600 feet, you know.
[00:36:54] Gerard Donnelly: Yeah.
[00:36:55] Gerard Donnelly: It's not much.
[00:36:57] Gerard Donnelly: It's just all the turns, you know, there's so many turns.
[00:37:02] Gerard Donnelly: And you look at that as one, so you turn here, and then go and do a U-turn.
[00:37:08] Gerard Donnelly: So you turn right, go and do a U-turn.
[00:37:10] Gerard Donnelly: And then, you know, a right turn, U-turn, U-turn, U-turn, U-turn.
[00:37:17] Gerard Donnelly: And then, you know, so this is the section that I'm talking about, pushing.
[00:37:21] Gerard Donnelly: Once you do that U-turn there, you push lap until you get all the way up to that point there.
[00:37:29] Gerard Donnelly: And then, obviously, if you wanted to, push lap for that section, and then lap for that section.
[00:37:35] Gerard Donnelly: But I wouldn't be.
[00:37:36] Gerard Donnelly: I'd just be riding in there.
[00:37:39] Gerard Donnelly: You know, just do that circuit as best you can.
[00:37:43] Gerard Donnelly: And then when you hit there, you push lap.
[00:37:47] Gerard Donnelly: All right?
[00:37:48] Gerard Donnelly: And then you push lap when you come out of there again.
[00:37:51] Gerard Donnelly: So you wouldn't touch it until right there.
[00:37:56] Gerard Donnelly: When you do that U-turn, you push lap again right there.
[00:38:00] Gerard Donnelly: Okay?
[00:38:01] Gerard Donnelly: Okay.
[00:38:02] Gerard Donnelly: And then you don't push lap again until you get to here again, that point, and then don't worry about pushing lap at all after that.
[00:38:14] Gerard Donnelly: So you're just using your number there all the way to the finish.
[00:38:18] Gerard Donnelly: Okay?
[00:38:19] Gerard Donnelly: Yep.
[00:38:19] Gerard Donnelly: Makes sense.
[00:38:21] Abby Jorgensen: It's a lot of U-turns.
[00:38:22] Abby Jorgensen: That's annoying.
[00:38:23] Abby Jorgensen: It is, yeah.
[00:38:24] Gerard Donnelly: And the run map is quite similar, I think.
[00:38:30] Gerard Donnelly: This is where she does, a lot of the guys do some training sessions on their bike there.
[00:38:34] Gerard Donnelly: So it's just really, you know, just going around that, around that course.
[00:38:45] Gerard Donnelly: So it's a lot of turns.
[00:38:48] Gerard Donnelly: And you do one big loop to the finish.
[00:38:51] Gerard Donnelly: Okay?
[00:38:52] Gerard Donnelly: Okay.
[00:38:52] Gerard Donnelly: It's quite tricky.
[00:38:54] Gerard Donnelly: You're just doing so many directional turns.
[00:39:02] Gerard Donnelly: Okay.
[00:39:05] Gerard Donnelly: Just make sure she sent you her race plan.
[00:39:09] Gerard Donnelly: Have you had a look at...
[00:39:11] Abby Jorgensen: He hasn't sent it yet, but I think she's working.
[00:39:15] Abby Jorgensen: Last night, she was working late and then traveling.
[00:39:17] Abby Jorgensen: Was it today?
[00:39:19] Abby Jorgensen: I have a camera.
[00:39:19] Abby Jorgensen: Keep my day straight.
[00:39:21] Abby Jorgensen: Whatever day it is there, Tuesday.
[00:39:23] Abby Jorgensen: It's Tuesday morning, yeah.
[00:39:24] Gerard Donnelly: Tuesday morning, yeah.
[00:39:27] Gerard Donnelly: So you go through her race-ready stuff yourself, so you've got a clear idea of what you think.
[00:39:39] Gerard Donnelly: 32-minute PB.
[00:39:41] Gerard Donnelly: Yeah.
[00:39:44] Abby Jorgensen: Oh, far out.
[00:39:46] Gerard Donnelly: Yeah, her running's improved a lot.
[00:39:48] Abby Jorgensen: She's been getting a lot of blisters, so it's been kind of a pain for her.
[00:39:54] Abby Jorgensen: But I don't why.
[00:39:56] Abby Jorgensen: Some people get...
[00:39:57] Abby Jorgensen: I don't get anything.
[00:39:59] Abby Jorgensen: I don't know how people...
[00:40:00] Gerard Donnelly: Yeah.
[00:40:01] Gerard Donnelly: It's got to be the shoe fit, I reckon.
[00:40:03] Gerard Donnelly: That's what I told her.
[00:40:04] Abby Jorgensen: I'm like, is it your shoes, your socks?
[00:40:06] Abby Jorgensen: She's like, I've tried everything, and I was like, I don't know.
[00:40:11] Gerard Donnelly: I would be encouraging her to go to a podiatrist or a running shoe shop that's got a treadmill and let them have a look.
[00:40:20] Gerard Donnelly: If your shoes are too tight, that will cause a blister for sure.
[00:40:25] Gerard Donnelly: Has she done the 60 Minute?
[00:40:27] Abby Jorgensen: Yes, last weekend.
[00:40:33] Abby Jorgensen: No, go back up, wait.
[00:40:37] Gerard Donnelly: There's a 1K, there's a 20 Minute.
[00:40:41] Gerard Donnelly: I'll go down, maybe.
[00:40:44] Abby Jorgensen: There's a half-mile.
[00:40:46] Abby Jorgensen: With the race.
[00:40:48] Abby Jorgensen: There is.
[00:40:50] Gerard Donnelly: Yeah.
[00:40:52] Gerard Donnelly: So just, you know, grab this.
[00:40:55] Abby Jorgensen: 161.
[00:40:57] Abby Jorgensen: 161.
[00:41:04] Gerard Donnelly: Did she just do out and back, did she?
[00:41:06] Gerard Donnelly: Yep.
[00:41:07] Gerard Donnelly: think so.
[00:41:08] Gerard Donnelly: Or 26.
[00:41:09] Gerard Donnelly: She started a little hot.
[00:41:11] Abby Jorgensen: Yep.
[00:41:13] Gerard Donnelly: That was a tailwind, I'd say.
[00:41:18] Gerard Donnelly: So this is one of the reasons why I would encourage them not to do 30 out, 30 back, because you actually blow yourself up.
[00:41:25] Gerard Donnelly: If you do 15 out and back, then you get an idea of what the tailwind.
[00:41:28] Gerard Donnelly: And she's doing 34 k's an hour at 160, and then she's doing 26 k's an hour.
[00:41:34] Gerard Donnelly: She's literally, it's like seven miles an hour slower, 157, into that headwind.
[00:41:41] Gerard Donnelly: It should be the other way around.
[00:41:43] Gerard Donnelly: You know, she's got to be pushing more watts into the headwind.
[00:41:48] Gerard Donnelly: But that's great numbers.
[00:41:49] Gerard Donnelly: And then has she been able to do 90 percent?
[00:41:52] Gerard Donnelly: What's 90 percent of 160?
[00:41:56] Gerard Donnelly: I'll my calculator.
[00:41:57] Gerard Donnelly: I like 160.
[00:41:58] Abby Jorgensen: 40 something.
[00:42:00] Abby Jorgensen: Hmm.
[00:42:01] Gerard Donnelly: So has she been able to do that in any of her race-ready stuff?
[00:42:07] Abby Jorgensen: Yeah.
[00:42:08] Abby Jorgensen: What's she been sitting at?
[00:42:09] Gerard Donnelly: 145 is 90%.
[00:42:21] Gerard Donnelly: 129 is 80%.
[00:42:24] Gerard Donnelly: Has she been able to sit in those ranges, Abby?
[00:42:26] Abby Jorgensen: Yeah, her 90K race-ready.
[00:42:32] Abby Jorgensen: That one?
[00:42:34] Gerard Donnelly: Yeah.
[00:42:39] Gerard Donnelly: Jesus, that's good.
[00:42:45] Gerard Donnelly: 132, she says she's at the lower end, 133.
[00:42:49] Gerard Donnelly: That's good.
[00:42:50] Gerard Donnelly: Good.
[00:42:54] Gerard Donnelly: Was she pushing herself here?
[00:42:58] Abby Jorgensen: Yeah, believe.
[00:42:59] Abby Jorgensen: I remember, I'm trying to remember, she said.
[00:43:04] Abby Jorgensen: And mean, it was, she was happy to be off the bike.
[00:43:11] Gerard Donnelly: Yeah, so she can do 135 at the end.
[00:43:16] Gerard Donnelly: That's pretty good.
[00:43:17] Gerard Donnelly: So her range is right, 130 or 129 to 145.
[00:43:24] Gerard Donnelly: Yeah, that's great.
[00:43:26] Gerard Donnelly: That's a really easy one.
[00:43:27] Gerard Donnelly: So make sure you've got all that information and tell her, you know, exactly what you want in the race plan.
[00:43:33] Gerard Donnelly: She's not done one before, has she?
[00:43:36] Gerard Donnelly: No.
[00:43:37] Gerard Donnelly: Have you got any examples of athletes' race plans that you really liked that you thought were really detailed?
[00:43:42] Gerard Donnelly: Have you got any?
[00:43:45] Abby Jorgensen: I mean, Nancy has some detailed ones, but they're almost too detailed.
[00:43:49] Gerard Donnelly: Yeah.
[00:43:50] Gerard Donnelly: Why don't I send you Beecher's race plan?
[00:43:56] Gerard Donnelly: I this is just what he sent me the other day.
[00:43:58] Gerard Donnelly: I really like this.
[00:44:05] Gerard Donnelly: This is just one example, and you can just send it to us saying, I'm sure we've got somewhere in our coaches stuff where there's race plans for 70.3 examples, and just say, hey, Michaela, here's an example of one of our athletes, you know, how much detail, they're going into.
[00:44:32] Gerard Donnelly: You could go a little bit further and get her to have a practice at the race calculator as well.
[00:44:38] Gerard Donnelly: The race calculator is just a bonus.
[00:44:40] Gerard Donnelly: It's, you know, it's giving you an idea.
[00:44:53] Gerard Donnelly: So just really making sure you give yourself enough time to talk to her before the race, not the last minute.
[00:45:00] Gerard Donnelly: Yeah.
[00:45:01] Gerard Donnelly: Yeah.
[00:45:01] Abby Jorgensen: We, uh, I think we're going to try for, it would be her Thursday, my Wednesday.
[00:45:07] Abby Jorgensen: Fantastic.
[00:45:07] Gerard Donnelly: Yep.
[00:45:08] Gerard Donnelly: Yep.
[00:45:09] Gerard Donnelly: Yep.
[00:45:10] Gerard Donnelly: And look, I'm, when, if someone's new, I'm giving them a two or three minute, uh, chat about what I want them to send me.
[00:45:18] Gerard Donnelly: I want them to go through their running off the bike, their fresh runs and, and document it in a, in an email, you know, heading run.
[00:45:27] Gerard Donnelly: Here's my previous runs off the bike.
[00:45:29] Gerard Donnelly: Here's my fresh 10 K.
[00:45:31] Gerard Donnelly: Here's my fresh half marathon.
[00:45:33] Gerard Donnelly: And based on all those paces, this is what I think I can do.
[00:45:38] Gerard Donnelly: And here's my run race.
[00:45:40] Gerard Donnelly: Here's my ride race ready, my 60 minute, my 20 minute, my 90 K, uh, the three by forties, get them to, you know, to, to write them in the email, you know, and then here's my swims and, and get them to talk about what they're going to think about.
[00:45:59] Gerard Donnelly: During the transition, she won't.
[00:46:02] Gerard Donnelly: What are they thinking about in the swim?
[00:46:04] Gerard Donnelly: And get them to write it all down.
[00:46:05] Gerard Donnelly: The night before, what am I planning to do with food, with my pre-race meal?
[00:46:11] Gerard Donnelly: You know, they're the things that I want the beginner athletes to think about so that in there, they've already thought about it in the middle of the week.
[00:46:19] Gerard Donnelly: And then what are they going to do, you know, Friday night for Saturday night for their main meal?
[00:46:25] Gerard Donnelly: What time are they getting up?
[00:46:26] Gerard Donnelly: What time does the race start?
[00:46:28] Gerard Donnelly: You know, a lot of the guys send me, you know, I'm getting up at 4.15.
[00:46:31] Gerard Donnelly: I'm going to do this, you know, breakfast, 5, leave the house, be at the venue by 5.30, bike set up, 6, have my swim, 7, have that time structure so that they've got less things to worry about because they're just following a plan.
[00:46:50] Gerard Donnelly: So that's the thing you're trying to help her with is, hey, Michaela, I want you to think about these things and write them down and then you and I, Michaela, can go through it together.
[00:47:00] Gerard Donnelly: what we're going to do.
[00:47:01] Gerard Donnelly: And you'll be able to give her tips.
[00:47:02] Gerard Donnelly: Hey, hey, Michaela, I don't think you're giving yourself enough time on race day to do the things you want to do.
[00:47:08] Gerard Donnelly: You might want to think about doing this.
[00:47:10] Gerard Donnelly: What are you thinking about consuming before you start the event?
[00:47:14] Gerard Donnelly: You know, what's your nutrition look like in the event?
[00:47:18] Gerard Donnelly: So get them to do all of that in the email, okay?
[00:47:22] Gerard Donnelly: Okay.
[00:47:22] Gerard Donnelly: And I just throw my hands in the air sometimes, and I've done all that explanation, and I get an email that says, bike time, swim time, run time, nothing else.
[00:47:33] Gerard Donnelly: And, like, I'm just swearing to myself going, what the ?
[00:47:37] Gerard Donnelly: After all I've just told them, you know, and, you know, I email them straight back.
[00:47:43] Gerard Donnelly: Tell me how you're going to get these swim, bike, and run times.
[00:47:48] Gerard Donnelly: Explain to me.
[00:47:49] Gerard Donnelly: How did you get these?
[00:47:51] Gerard Donnelly: You know, show me evidence.
[00:47:53] Gerard Donnelly: It's almost like a teacher saying to a student, you know, how did you get that maths answer?
[00:47:59] Gerard Donnelly: How did you get the answer?
[00:48:00] Gerard Donnelly: Show me your words.
[00:48:02] Gerard Donnelly: You know, here's the equation and here's the solution with no working about how you got that solution.
[00:48:09] Gerard Donnelly: You know, here's what your swim, bike, and running expectation times are.
[00:48:14] Gerard Donnelly: Tell me how you're going to get that based on the evidence of your training.
[00:48:19] Gerard Donnelly: Okay?
[00:48:20] Abby Jorgensen: Yep, makes sense.
[00:48:21] Abby Jorgensen: She's pretty detailed, so I think.
[00:48:23] Gerard Donnelly: Yep.
[00:48:25] Abby Jorgensen: She was already nervous last week, so I've already had to calm her down a little bit.
[00:48:31] Gerard Donnelly: And look, Gerard Donnelly, that's why we want this race plan.
[00:48:34] Gerard Donnelly: Once we discuss this, your nerves should be there, but they should only be worried about how am I going to execute?
[00:48:40] Gerard Donnelly: You know, that's the key thing.
[00:48:42] Gerard Donnelly: You know, remember the call I have with you.
[00:48:45] Gerard Donnelly: The calls I have with you, try to emulate that.
[00:48:48] Gerard Donnelly: I tried to bring the anxiety down with you by saying, you know, hey, Abby, the times are not important.
[00:48:54] Gerard Donnelly: It's just basically you going out there and enjoying the day, sticking to your race plan that you've got, and you'll be fine.
[00:49:00] Gerard Donnelly: And...
[00:49:01] Gerard Donnelly: And...
[00:49:01] Gerard Donnelly: And...
[00:49:01] Gerard Donnelly: I'm saying to you from a coach, I don't want you to worry about what the coach thinks about your times.
[00:49:06] Gerard Donnelly: I want you to have a really good race based on this is the way you're prepared.
[00:49:11] Gerard Donnelly: This is the form you've got this week.
[00:49:13] Gerard Donnelly: Remember, we talked about all those things.
[00:49:15] Gerard Donnelly: And you can do these numbers.
[00:49:17] Gerard Donnelly: You've just got to stay in your disciplined range.
[00:49:20] Gerard Donnelly: Just stay in the ranges and it will pan out fine.
[00:49:23] Gerard Donnelly: They're all the things I was saying to you.
[00:49:25] Gerard Donnelly: If you get ahead of yourself, you're going to self-sabotage the rest of your day.
[00:49:31] Gerard Donnelly: And you use yourself as an example and use your conversation with me.
[00:49:36] Gerard Donnelly: Use examples all the time, Abby, about when you're coaching other athletes.
[00:49:41] Gerard Donnelly: This is how Gerard coached me through the Ironman.
[00:49:43] Gerard Donnelly: This is what I had to concentrate on.
[00:49:45] Gerard Donnelly: And this is what I think I did really well.
[00:49:47] Gerard Donnelly: I ended up having the best marathon run of my entire career.
[00:49:51] Gerard Donnelly: And I'll probably, I'll look back on that race and go, far out I raced that one well.
[00:49:56] Gerard Donnelly: And you should be more proud of that.
[00:49:58] Gerard Donnelly: And you should be telling them, I'm proud of it because I stayed disciplined.
[00:50:01] Gerard Donnelly: And, you know, stayed true to my numbers.
[00:50:05] Gerard Donnelly: And it allowed me to have a really, even though it was a very hard day, I still enjoyed it, you know, compared to everybody around me who was, you know, losing the plot because they just weren't disciplined.
[00:50:18] Gerard Donnelly: So use your experience that you've got already.
[00:50:21] Gerard Donnelly: Use the examples that you've had interacting with me.
[00:50:24] Gerard Donnelly: And your job is to give them this really at ease feeling that they're well prepared and all they've got to do is execute.
[00:50:34] Gerard Donnelly: That's actually what you're trying to get across.
[00:50:38] Gerard Donnelly: And they'll come away from that meeting super excited that, oh, all I've got to do is execute.
[00:50:44] Gerard Donnelly: You know, it can't be that hard.
[00:50:45] Gerard Donnelly: I know my numbers.
[00:50:46] Gerard Donnelly: I've just got to do them.
[00:50:49] Gerard Donnelly: So that takes the anxiety away.
[00:50:52] Gerard Donnelly: Everybody will have nerves.
[00:50:54] Gerard Donnelly: You should have nerves because you want to do well.
[00:50:59] Gerard Donnelly: But, yeah, you OK with that?
[00:51:01] Gerard Donnelly: Oh, yep.
[00:51:04] Abby Jorgensen: Mark Kroll, he's kind of new, isn't he?
[00:51:06] Gerard Donnelly: What's he up to?
[00:51:07] Abby Jorgensen: He's doing pretty good.
[00:51:12] Abby Jorgensen: Yeah, we've had to play around with the schedule a little bit, but I think we got a good working plan now.
[00:51:25] Abby Jorgensen: He's going to do a half marathon in November.
[00:51:28] Abby Jorgensen: Yes, okay.
[00:51:28] Gerard Donnelly: Okay.
[00:51:30] Gerard Donnelly: Would you mind, for me, just doing notes and hide them?
[00:51:34] Gerard Donnelly: So just when I open up, I always want to know what their goal is, what their big goal is.
[00:51:46] Gerard Donnelly: Is he doing Ironman, is he?
[00:51:48] Gerard Donnelly: Yeah, he's doing another half next year.
[00:51:52] Abby Jorgensen: A half Ironman.
[00:51:58] Gerard Donnelly: What month?
[00:51:59] Gerard Donnelly: Thanks.
[00:52:00] Gerard Donnelly: Thank you.
[00:52:00] Gerard Donnelly: You
[00:52:03] Gerard Donnelly: It doesn't really matter.
[00:52:04] Gerard Donnelly: But if you could just have that for each athlete, when we have a meeting, I can just quickly go and see, yeah, what are we training for here?
[00:52:14] Gerard Donnelly: Okay.
[00:52:15] Gerard Donnelly: You just keep it hidden, Abby, so he doesn't see.
[00:52:20] Gerard Donnelly: So Paul, I'll just give you an example of what Paul does.
[00:52:25] Gerard Donnelly: This is really helpful when we have our meetings.
[00:52:34] Gerard Donnelly: So Paul's got, you know, his goals are here, Sydney, Melbourne, Geelong, and a sub 10K40.
[00:52:42] Gerard Donnelly: And he carries that through each, he just keeps copying that and it's hidden.
[00:52:46] Gerard Donnelly: Okay.
[00:52:47] Gerard Donnelly: He just repeats it every week.
[00:52:49] Gerard Donnelly: So every time, anytime I open up any of his athletes, I can see what their goals are.
[00:52:55] Gerard Donnelly: And it's good for you too.
[00:52:57] Gerard Donnelly: I mean, I know you know their goals, but it keeps, keeps it in front you.
[00:53:01] Gerard Donnelly: Mind that every week you can see this guy's going to do the Noosa Tri, he's going to do a marathon in October, half marathon, he's a primary school teacher, all that sort of stuff's really helpful, and he's doing Melbourne, okay?
[00:53:15] Gerard Donnelly: So this is this real summary of each athlete.
[00:53:19] Gerard Donnelly: I think it's really clever.
[00:53:22] Gerard Donnelly: Not only helps me whenever I open up any of Paul's athletes, I don't have to go searching, what race is he doing?
[00:53:28] Gerard Donnelly: Oh yeah, here it is, there's a half, half marathon, there's Noosa, I don't want to do this, that takes me 30 seconds, I just don't, I just want to, you know, it's so much easier, isn't it?
[00:53:38] Gerard Donnelly: It's just there, okay?
[00:53:46] Gerard Donnelly: So you're happy with him?
[00:53:48] Gerard Donnelly: Yeah, yeah, he's good.
[00:53:50] Abby Jorgensen: He communicates well, we've got everything under control, I think.
[00:53:55] Gerard Donnelly: Yeah, is there anybody that you want help with?
[00:54:00] Abby Jorgensen: Um, I'll tell you.
[00:54:01] Abby Jorgensen: Let's see here.
[00:54:09] Abby Jorgensen: Coco has Italy this week.
[00:54:21] Gerard Donnelly: Fantastic.
[00:54:26] Gerard Donnelly: And she's all set with her 60 minute and stuff?
[00:54:30] Abby Jorgensen: Yeah, she did a...
[00:54:32] Abby Jorgensen: A 90.
[00:54:34] Abby Jorgensen: She just did an Olympic distance, so...
[00:54:37] Abby Jorgensen: Yes, you got that data.
[00:54:39] Gerard Donnelly: Yeah, got that data.
[00:54:41] Gerard Donnelly: Yeah.
[00:54:42] Gerard Donnelly: Yeah.
[00:54:44] Gerard Donnelly: That's great.
[00:54:45] Abby Jorgensen: And then she, yeah, she did a 90K this last weekend.
[00:54:50] Abby Jorgensen: Oof, that's a big one.
[00:54:53] Gerard Donnelly: Um...
[00:54:54] Gerard Donnelly: Yeah.
[00:54:56] Gerard Donnelly: Yeah, yeah.
[00:54:57] Gerard Donnelly: Yeah.
[00:54:58] Gerard Donnelly: Yeah.
[00:55:00] Gerard Donnelly: Um...
[00:55:01] Gerard Donnelly: Yeah.
[00:55:13] Gerard Donnelly: That's really good.
[00:55:15] Gerard Donnelly: Yeah.
[00:55:16] Abby Jorgensen: And then I think her Olympic distance was close to 190.
[00:55:22] Abby Jorgensen: Yeah.
[00:55:23] Gerard Donnelly: Same thing again.
[00:55:24] Gerard Donnelly: Just get the 90% of whatever the other file.
[00:55:32] Gerard Donnelly: That one?
[00:55:33] Gerard Donnelly: Yeah, that one.
[00:55:34] Gerard Donnelly: And remember, this will be a little bit conservative because this is in the middle of a race after a swim, so.
[00:55:45] Gerard Donnelly: What did you say?
[00:55:45] Gerard Donnelly: 190 something, was it?
[00:55:47] Gerard Donnelly: Yeah, 191.
[00:55:48] Gerard Donnelly: Yeah, well, she was 95.
[00:55:50] Gerard Donnelly: So maybe take 90% of 195.
[00:55:53] Gerard Donnelly: What's that?
[00:56:00] Gerard Donnelly: That's 176.
[00:56:01] Gerard Donnelly: What did she do?
[00:56:01] Gerard Donnelly: the 66,
[00:56:01] Gerard Donnelly: last week.
[00:56:05] Abby Jorgensen: It was right around there.
[00:56:10] Gerard Donnelly: Yeah, that's great.
[00:56:11] Gerard Donnelly: Good.
[00:56:17] Gerard Donnelly: That's an out and back section there.
[00:56:20] Gerard Donnelly: This is what I would do.
[00:56:21] Gerard Donnelly: always try to check what they do.
[00:56:24] Gerard Donnelly: At the end, you're doing 183.
[00:56:33] Abby Jorgensen: She tried to find a fairly flat, because Italy's fairly flat, but then, obviously, we're training for Marbello, so.
[00:56:43] Abby Jorgensen: Yep.
[00:56:49] Gerard Donnelly: Yep, so, she's really strong at the end.
[00:56:54] Gerard Donnelly: That's great.
[00:56:54] Gerard Donnelly: She's in the 180s, she?
[00:56:56] Abby Jorgensen: And I feel like no matter what we push, her run, as well as.-7255 366
[00:57:05] Gerard Donnelly: She's a bit different, Abby.
[00:57:06] Gerard Donnelly: I would be saying to her, look, you know, in the training sessions, you're strong at the end.
[00:57:12] Gerard Donnelly: You've been pushing 180s, you know, and the top of the range for you is 176.
[00:57:16] Gerard Donnelly: So I would say her range needs to be adjusted up a bit.
[00:57:22] Gerard Donnelly: Like 160 to 200 is her range.
[00:57:27] Gerard Donnelly: Not below it, not above.
[00:57:30] Gerard Donnelly: But really trying to get it to really be narrow and try to ride somewhere between that 170 and 190.
[00:57:36] Gerard Donnelly: Give her a 20 watt range.
[00:57:37] Gerard Donnelly: Okay?
[00:57:38] Gerard Donnelly: Yeah.
[00:57:39] Abby Jorgensen: Yeah, I'm pretty sure she's capable of that.
[00:57:42] Abby Jorgensen: Yeah.
[00:57:43] Gerard Donnelly: And tell her to have the freedom to, you know, she's a racer.
[00:57:47] Gerard Donnelly: So it's different to the other age groupers.
[00:57:49] Gerard Donnelly: know, someone who's at the front end, you know, you have a different conversation with someone who's going to be on the podium.
[00:57:56] Gerard Donnelly: And tell her to, you know, take some risks.
[00:57:58] Gerard Donnelly: It's not your A race.
[00:58:00] Gerard Donnelly: It's the world.
[00:58:01] Gerard Donnelly: The world title is an A-race, isn't it?
[00:58:04] Abby Jorgensen: Yeah.
[00:58:05] Abby Jorgensen: So tell her to, you know.
[00:58:08] Gerard Donnelly: Yeah, I have a call with her tomorrow or Wednesday.
[00:58:12] Abby Jorgensen: Right, okay.
[00:58:14] Abby Jorgensen: I guess it's her Wednesday night, my Wednesday midday.
[00:58:18] Gerard Donnelly: Yes, okay.
[00:58:19] Gerard Donnelly: Yeah.
[00:58:21] Abby Jorgensen: Peter, he's been still sore from Santa Cruz.
[00:58:25] Gerard Donnelly: Is he?
[00:58:27] Abby Jorgensen: He was going to try to get a massage today.
[00:58:31] Abby Jorgensen: But, yeah, I was struggling with some.
[00:58:32] Gerard Donnelly: Sorry, I can't find him.
[00:58:34] Gerard Donnelly: Where the hell is he?
[00:58:34] Gerard Donnelly: There he is.
[00:58:35] Gerard Donnelly: Right there.
[00:58:37] Gerard Donnelly: Which I was like, I asked him if there was how much downhill.
[00:58:42] Abby Jorgensen: He said he did take the downhills pretty fast at Santa Cruz.
[00:58:46] Gerard Donnelly: Yeah.
[00:58:46] Abby Jorgensen: And then he also.
[00:58:49] Abby Jorgensen: he's going to Mabaya.
[00:58:50] Abby Jorgensen: Yeah.
[00:58:53] Abby Jorgensen: He also, I told you, well, he at Santa Cruz, he took the world championship slot for next year as well.
[00:59:01] Abby Jorgensen: So, thank
[00:59:01] Abby Jorgensen: Whatever that's going to be, I guess.
[00:59:05] Abby Jorgensen: No, it'd be 70.3, whatever, I guess, Nice.
[00:59:10] Gerard Donnelly: Well, my Bay of course is, make sure you've got a guy doing it now.
[00:59:16] Gerard Donnelly: So have you had a look at the webpage there?
[00:59:19] Gerard Donnelly: Yeah, we've looked at it kind of together.
[00:59:22] Abby Jorgensen: He wrote a course last year, or this Saturday, he wrote 6,000 feet of elevation where he's at right now.
[00:59:30] Abby Jorgensen: But when he goes to, when he moves to North Carolina or whatever, he won't have as much.
[00:59:38] Abby Jorgensen: He says there's still some hills there, but.
[00:59:43] Abby Jorgensen: Yep.
[00:59:51] Gerard Donnelly: Where's North Carolina?
[00:59:53] Gerard Donnelly: Abby, help me here.
[00:59:54] Gerard Donnelly: It's on the East Coast.
[00:59:57] Gerard Donnelly: Far East Coast, he's moving across the country.
[01:00:00] Abby Jorgensen: Thank you.
[01:00:01] Abby Jorgensen: you.
[01:00:06] Gerard Donnelly: Is it, am I in the right direction here?
[01:00:08] Gerard Donnelly: Is it near Florida?
[01:00:09] Gerard Donnelly: There it is.
[01:00:10] Gerard Donnelly: Yeah, yeah, okay.
[01:00:11] Gerard Donnelly: Oof!
[01:00:13] Gerard Donnelly: All that area, Florida, that's just pancake flat.
[01:00:17] Abby Jorgensen: If you go, if you go up, like, towards the Tennessee, North Carolina border, you have Smoky Mountains.
[01:00:24] Gerard Donnelly: So he's going to be in that area.
[01:00:26] Abby Jorgensen: So he said there's going to be some hills that he can get to to ride.
[01:00:32] Abby Jorgensen: But.
[01:00:34] Gerard Donnelly: Yep, great.
[01:00:36] Gerard Donnelly: Okay.
[01:00:41] Gerard Donnelly: All right, well, if he's still a bit sore, then.
[01:00:46] Abby Jorgensen: Yeah, he was going to get a massage today and we'll see how he fares tomorrow.
[01:00:57] Gerard Donnelly: He's been training better since we.
[01:00:59] Abby Jorgensen: Yeah, he's been.
[01:01:01] Abby Jorgensen: And actually, yeah, communicating and everything.
[01:01:06] Gerard Donnelly: So.
[01:01:07] Gerard Donnelly: Yeah.
[01:01:09] Gerard Donnelly: Okay.
[01:01:13] Gerard Donnelly: I've got another call coming soon, unfortunately.
[01:01:16] Gerard Donnelly: I'm going to have to.
[01:01:17] Gerard Donnelly: Anybody else?
[01:01:19] Abby Jorgensen: Maybe Nancy is four weeks out from Kona.
[01:01:24] Abby Jorgensen: Yeah.
[01:01:29] Abby Jorgensen: I love how it shows the reds for, because it's Tuesday there.
[01:01:34] Abby Jorgensen: Yes.
[01:01:38] Abby Jorgensen: It's funny, isn't it?
[01:01:40] Abby Jorgensen: Well, yeah, if it's for the athletes over there, it won't show up for me.
[01:01:45] Abby Jorgensen: I'll be like, they text me that they did it.
[01:01:48] Abby Jorgensen: And then I'm like, oh, I have to go in.
[01:01:50] Abby Jorgensen: yeah.
[01:01:51] Abby Jorgensen: Refresh it.
[01:01:52] Gerard Donnelly: Yeah.
[01:01:54] Abby Jorgensen: I feel like she's writing better.
[01:01:57] Abby Jorgensen: I just, I don't know, sometimes.
[01:02:01] Abby Jorgensen: She's so analytical.
[01:02:03] Abby Jorgensen: I mean, it's better.
[01:02:06] Abby Jorgensen: Yeah.
[01:02:08] Abby Jorgensen: A lot of churns.
[01:02:09] Abby Jorgensen: Yeah.
[01:02:10] Gerard Donnelly: As long as they're churns, that's a churn.
[01:02:13] Gerard Donnelly: Yeah.
[01:02:14] Abby Jorgensen: She said there was a lightning storm, so she had to quit this one early and then went back.
[01:02:21] Gerard Donnelly: Yeah.
[01:02:33] Gerard Donnelly: Oh, God.
[01:02:34] Gerard Donnelly: She's creating her own turns.
[01:02:37] Gerard Donnelly: Why is she doing squares there?
[01:02:40] Gerard Donnelly: I don't know.
[01:02:40] Abby Jorgensen: I must be trying to think where she's at.
[01:02:50] Gerard Donnelly: That's a weird little circuit there.
[01:02:52] Gerard Donnelly: Yeah.
[01:02:52] Abby Jorgensen: I don't know if it's a path or what it is.
[01:02:58] Gerard Donnelly: She's better off doing these long straight bits.
[01:03:02] Gerard Donnelly: You know, keeping the pressure on.
[01:03:07] Gerard Donnelly: But when she does this along the straight bit, that's what we want to get her used to.
[01:03:12] Gerard Donnelly: You know, you know that.
[01:03:17] Gerard Donnelly: And, you know, if she's doing stuff like this, she can't keep the pressure on.
[01:03:24] Gerard Donnelly: It's too many turns.
[01:03:27] Gerard Donnelly: Get rid of this stuff.
[01:03:28] Gerard Donnelly: Do this stuff.
[01:03:29] Gerard Donnelly: The long stretches.
[01:03:32] Gerard Donnelly: don't know why she would do that.
[01:03:35] Abby Jorgensen: Who knows?
[01:03:35] Abby Jorgensen: It's fancy.
[01:03:36] Gerard Donnelly: Yeah, well, I think it gives her an opportunity to have some recovery.
[01:03:42] Gerard Donnelly: Or she's going past a drink bottle.
[01:03:45] Abby Jorgensen: Yeah, she says she always does park right in the spot where she can exchange bottles.
[01:03:51] Gerard Donnelly: Yeah.
[01:03:54] Gerard Donnelly: She's had a drink there, obviously, because it's right there.
[01:03:58] Gerard Donnelly: Yeah.
[01:03:59] Gerard Donnelly: Yeah.
[01:03:59] Gerard Donnelly: Yeah.
[01:04:00] Gerard Donnelly: Yeah.
[01:04:00] Gerard Donnelly: Yeah.
[01:04:01] Gerard Donnelly: Yeah.
[01:04:01] Gerard Donnelly: Yeah.
[01:04:01] Gerard Donnelly: Yeah.
[01:04:09] Abby Jorgensen: I was questioning my, so her Wednesday is always like her Saturday, and then I needed to get her another long run, but then I have the Friday, Sunday, I didn't know if that was enough recovery Friday to do another long run or move the bike.
[01:04:27] Abby Jorgensen: No, that's fine, because we would do that long run on a Sunday normally.
[01:04:31] Gerard Donnelly: Yeah, okay.
[01:04:32] Gerard Donnelly: That's absolutely fine, Abby.
[01:04:34] Gerard Donnelly: Okay.
[01:04:35] Gerard Donnelly: Yeah.
[01:04:38] Gerard Donnelly: No, that's perfect.
[01:04:42] Gerard Donnelly: Okay.
[01:04:43] Gerard Donnelly: So she's getting three runs of an hour to two hours, and obviously that long run, she's going to be out there for four and a half, five hours, isn't she?
[01:04:55] Gerard Donnelly: Yeah, at least five and a half, probably, I would say.
[01:04:58] Abby Jorgensen: better with her.
[01:04:59] Abby Jorgensen: For me, to be doesn't for No,
[01:05:02] Abby Jorgensen: Yeah, she runs like a – in Santa Cruz, she ran 2.30.
[01:05:09] Abby Jorgensen: Yeah, it's okay.
[01:05:12] Gerard Donnelly: She's done three and a half there.
[01:05:14] Gerard Donnelly: I mean, yeah, she's done a lot of running.
[01:05:16] Abby Jorgensen: It's just she's not fast, I guess.
[01:05:20] Gerard Donnelly: Yep.
[01:05:22] Gerard Donnelly: Have you shortened this one for a reason compared to there?
[01:05:26] Gerard Donnelly: Or is you worried from that that it's too much?
[01:05:28] Gerard Donnelly: Yeah, over an hour and a half.
[01:05:30] Gerard Donnelly: Yep.
[01:05:31] Abby Jorgensen: They're – Yeah.
[01:05:34] Gerard Donnelly: I'd maybe add a bit more here, Abby.
[01:05:36] Gerard Donnelly: Maybe another – make that a 90-minute run.
[01:05:39] Gerard Donnelly: Okay.
[01:05:41] Gerard Donnelly: And that way she's got five hours.
[01:05:43] Gerard Donnelly: Of running.
[01:05:44] Gerard Donnelly: Okay.
[01:05:45] Gerard Donnelly: Yeah.
[01:05:46] Gerard Donnelly: You have two plus the three.
[01:05:50] Gerard Donnelly: Okay.
[01:05:54] Gerard Donnelly: Anybody got other races really close?
[01:05:57] Gerard Donnelly: Or anybody who's just started that you need?
[01:06:01] Gerard Donnelly: Um…
[01:06:02] Gerard Donnelly: No.
[01:06:04] Abby Jorgensen: I mean, Dougie's just, he's doing a high rocks in October, and then another cycling.
[01:06:13] Abby Jorgensen: He has a short triathlon this weekend, but he's been all over the place with travel and work.
[01:06:20] Abby Jorgensen: But it's the sprint, so.
[01:06:24] Gerard Donnelly: Yeah.
[01:06:28] Abby Jorgensen: But I just talked to him, and he's hoping things calm down now that he has the high rocks in October, end of October.
[01:06:39] Gerard Donnelly: Yep.
[01:06:39] Gerard Donnelly: Great.
[01:06:40] Gerard Donnelly: We talked about Andrew.
[01:06:41] Gerard Donnelly: talked about Cindy, Isabella.
[01:06:44] Gerard Donnelly: We don't really need to talk about it.
[01:06:45] Gerard Donnelly: What is she doing?
[01:06:45] Gerard Donnelly: Anything?
[01:06:46] Gerard Donnelly: We put her on a bike.
[01:06:47] Abby Jorgensen: We have done a bike session.
[01:06:50] Abby Jorgensen: Oh, my goodness.
[01:06:52] Abby Jorgensen: So, think we, I know, if you go to Saturday, I think it's the first one she got her power to come across.
[01:07:02] Abby Jorgensen: I don't think she did the session right, because we were just trying to figure out power.
[01:07:08] Gerard Donnelly: She's actually done something.
[01:07:10] Gerard Donnelly: You're achieving the impossible.
[01:07:13] Gerard Donnelly: One small step at a time, so we're hoping.
[01:07:15] Gerard Donnelly: You're the impossible here.
[01:07:18] Gerard Donnelly: I always like to skip over it anyway.
[01:07:20] Gerard Donnelly: So Kevin, talked about it.
[01:07:21] Gerard Donnelly: Richard, is he okay?
[01:07:25] Abby Jorgensen: Yeah, we're just gradually introducing running back in for him, and then he tried to swim.
[01:07:34] Abby Jorgensen: He says Marl Bay is not out of the question, because he was able to swim yesterday, or today, yes, Sunday.
[01:07:43] Gerard Donnelly: What's his injury?
[01:07:44] Gerard Donnelly: What's he got?
[01:07:47] Abby Jorgensen: Reattach the biceps.
[01:07:48] Gerard Donnelly: Oh my goodness, yes.
[01:07:51] Abby Jorgensen: So, we're just going to, he's just going to try to swim once a week and do some drills and get his strength back in his arm.
[01:07:59] Gerard Donnelly: Yeah, okay.
[01:08:00] Gerard Donnelly: And running, basically.
[01:08:02] Gerard Donnelly: It's still six more weeks, so it could be a chance.
[01:08:05] Gerard Donnelly: That's what he said.
[01:08:06] Abby Jorgensen: He's like, I don't want to totally say I can't do it.
[01:08:11] Gerard Donnelly: Is it Olympic day at distance, is it?
[01:08:13] Gerard Donnelly: Sprint?
[01:08:13] Gerard Donnelly: Yeah.
[01:08:14] Gerard Donnelly: That should be achievable.
[01:08:16] Gerard Donnelly: Yeah, it's good.
[01:08:18] Gerard Donnelly: Okay.
[01:08:20] Gerard Donnelly: I know we're rushing here.
[01:08:21] Gerard Donnelly: Sorry.
[01:08:25] Abby Jorgensen: Blair just got done with like four days of monstrous cycling charity event.
[01:08:32] Abby Jorgensen: That's right.
[01:08:33] Gerard Donnelly: Yeah.
[01:08:34] Gerard Donnelly: So he'll need recovery, which is what you're giving him.
[01:08:37] Gerard Donnelly: Yeah.
[01:08:40] Gerard Donnelly: Yeah.
[01:08:41] Gerard Donnelly: Is he fit enough to run?
[01:08:43] Gerard Donnelly: he okay?
[01:08:44] Gerard Donnelly: Yeah.
[01:08:45] Gerard Donnelly: Yeah, he's been, he ran, was running before the cycling things.
[01:08:49] Gerard Donnelly: Yeah.
[01:08:52] Gerard Donnelly: So I would try to fit another run in, if you could, in his program.
[01:08:56] Gerard Donnelly: He's only got two runs.
[01:08:58] Gerard Donnelly: Let's see if he can get another run in.
[01:08:59] Gerard Donnelly: What's his goal?
[01:09:01] Gerard Donnelly: Uh, Iron Man.
[01:09:02] Abby Jorgensen: And
[01:09:02] Abby Jorgensen: Canada next, like, August, so a year out right now.
[01:09:06] Gerard Donnelly: Yep.
[01:09:08] Gerard Donnelly: Yeah.
[01:09:09] Gerard Donnelly: Okay, maybe do sort of a run off the bike here or something.
[01:09:13] Gerard Donnelly: Okay.
[01:09:15] Gerard Donnelly: Okay?
[01:09:15] Gerard Donnelly: Yep.
[01:09:16] Gerard Donnelly: Well, I mean, I would be doing this, Abby, I'd be putting the run there, and then, you know, probably the swim over here, and just alternating the rides there, but have another run in here.
[01:09:28] Gerard Donnelly: Okay.
[01:09:30] Gerard Donnelly: Sorry to take over, but that would be just to get that extra run in.
[01:09:37] Gerard Donnelly: And that means, you know, this swim is optional.
[01:09:40] Gerard Donnelly: That's what I would say to him.
[01:09:41] Gerard Donnelly: The run's more important.
[01:09:44] Gerard Donnelly: Okay?
[01:09:44] Abby Jorgensen: Okay.
[01:09:46] Gerard Donnelly: So if he says I can't do two sessions in one day, great.
[01:09:50] Gerard Donnelly: Choose the run.
[01:09:52] Gerard Donnelly: Okay.
[01:09:54] Abby Jorgensen: Dwayne?
[01:09:57] Abby Jorgensen: Yeah, I mean, he has.
[01:09:59] Abby Jorgensen: Yeah, I Okay.
[01:10:00] Abby Jorgensen: Okay.
[01:10:01] Abby Jorgensen: Okay.
[01:10:01] Abby Jorgensen: Okay.
[01:10:04] Gerard Donnelly: I'm drawing a blank.
[01:10:06] Abby Jorgensen: The December Ironman, Busselton.
[01:10:08] Abby Jorgensen: Oh, Busselton, right, okay.
[01:10:10] Gerard Donnelly: I'm like, what?
[01:10:12] Abby Jorgensen: But so he did – yeah, we're testing him this week.
[01:10:21] Gerard Donnelly: You've been pushing him good.
[01:10:22] Gerard Donnelly: Yeah, he's doing pretty good.
[01:10:25] Gerard Donnelly: Do you find it so much better now you've done an Ironman preparation for yourself that you feel confident in – Yeah, it makes more sense to know what you have to build up to from there.
[01:10:36] Abby Jorgensen: That's why I'm curious, too, why I kind of want to do like a – would like to do like a running – like a marathon or something so I know what it's like to do like a running block or something.
[01:10:49] Gerard Donnelly: Well, I'm happy to take you through a marathon program.
[01:10:53] Abby Jorgensen: Yeah, so, I mean, that might be something that interests me.
[01:10:57] Abby Jorgensen: Even if I don't find one this year, just take me through a running block over the winter or something.
[01:11:08] Gerard Donnelly: Okay, Philippe.
[01:11:14] Gerard Donnelly: You got anything coming up?
[01:11:17] Abby Jorgensen: No, nothing coming up because he just finished an Olympic.
[01:11:21] Abby Jorgensen: So I got to figure out his, it'll be winter there too.
[01:11:25] Abby Jorgensen: So winter is fast approaching, he said, up there, even faster than here.
[01:11:31] Gerard Donnelly: So that discussion I had with you about what we're looking for during winter, really hone in on that.
[01:11:39] Gerard Donnelly: You know, we want to really build your strength and conditioning on the bike and as a runner and as a swimmer during this winter so that the races you select next year, you've had a full six months of training with us.
[01:11:52] Gerard Donnelly: Yeah, really push that, you know, this is a great time to really get that endurance fitness bank in your body.
[01:12:01] Gerard Donnelly: So.
[01:12:02] Gerard Donnelly: Thank
[01:12:05] Gerard Donnelly: Erin?
[01:12:08] Abby Jorgensen: No, we're just trying to build some consistency.
[01:12:11] Abby Jorgensen: Oh, my God.
[01:12:12] Gerard Donnelly: I know.
[01:12:13] Abby Jorgensen: Well, with her injury and stuff, and she's been traveling for work, and then now her parents are in town from Australia.
[01:12:20] Abby Jorgensen: And then she's going on vacation with them Wednesday.
[01:12:28] Gerard Donnelly: Okay, we'll just keep pushing.
[01:12:31] Gerard Donnelly: Do something each day, Erin.
[01:12:33] Gerard Donnelly: Yeah.
[01:12:35] Gerard Donnelly: Okay.
[01:12:35] Gerard Donnelly: Riley?
[01:12:37] Gerard Donnelly: He's good.
[01:12:37] Abby Jorgensen: He has a gravel race next week, I believe.
[01:12:42] Abby Jorgensen: Yeah, next week.
[01:12:44] Abby Jorgensen: But he got sick a little bit last week.
[01:12:47] Abby Jorgensen: Yep.
[01:12:49] Abby Jorgensen: So we have to improvise a little bit.
[01:12:54] Abby Jorgensen: But, yeah, he felt good this morning.
[01:12:59] Gerard Donnelly: Good.
[01:13:00] Gerard Donnelly: Has he got a big track?
[01:13:02] Gerard Donnelly: Is coming up?
[01:13:03] Abby Jorgensen: He has Ironman Texas next April.
[01:13:07] Abby Jorgensen: Yes, okay.
[01:13:09] Gerard Donnelly: Yeah.
[01:13:10] Abby Jorgensen: But he's going to do a couple of bike races and stuff like that.
[01:13:14] Abby Jorgensen: Where's Riley live?
[01:13:16] Abby Jorgensen: Texas.
[01:13:18] Gerard Donnelly: Okay, so the weather's freezing there as well during winter?
[01:13:21] Abby Jorgensen: No, it might get down to 50s and 60s.
[01:13:26] Gerard Donnelly: So you can train really well.
[01:13:28] Abby Jorgensen: Pretty much through the...
[01:13:30] Abby Jorgensen: They all get occasional snow and random stuff, but it's rare.
[01:13:34] Gerard Donnelly: Yeah.
[01:13:35] Gerard Donnelly: Yep, okay.
[01:13:38] Gerard Donnelly: Oh, for instance.
[01:13:40] Abby Jorgensen: I mean, he has a sprint this weekend, but he's been doing really well.
[01:13:45] Abby Jorgensen: Yep.
[01:13:48] Abby Jorgensen: So...
[01:13:50] Abby Jorgensen: He's Texas as well.
[01:13:52] Gerard Donnelly: Yep.
[01:13:56] Gerard Donnelly: That's great.
[01:13:57] Gerard Donnelly: He's a very attention to detail guy, isn't he?
[01:14:00] Gerard Donnelly: Yeah.
[01:14:00] Abby Jorgensen: and he's very...
[01:14:01] Abby Jorgensen: .
[01:14:01] Abby Jorgensen: .
[01:14:04] Gerard Donnelly: Pretty consistent with everything, too.
[01:14:07] Abby Jorgensen: That's great.
[01:14:08] Gerard Donnelly: Has he got any other big goals?
[01:14:10] Abby Jorgensen: He has like a 70.3 at the end of this.
[01:14:16] Abby Jorgensen: Yeah, there you go.
[01:14:17] Abby Jorgensen: Oilmen.
[01:14:17] Abby Jorgensen: It's not like an Ironman-sponsored event.
[01:14:20] Abby Jorgensen: It's a 70.3.
[01:14:24] Gerard Donnelly: Okay.
[01:14:26] Gerard Donnelly: Bill?
[01:14:30] Abby Jorgensen: Uh, Ironman, Chattanooga.
[01:14:33] Abby Jorgensen: That's next year, yeah?
[01:14:35] Gerard Donnelly: No, four weeks from now.
[01:14:37] Abby Jorgensen: Four weeks.
[01:14:38] Abby Jorgensen: Ironman, should.
[01:14:39] Gerard Donnelly: How can I not remember this?
[01:14:42] Abby Jorgensen: I don't know how I remember all of it, actually.
[01:14:46] Gerard Donnelly: Okay.
[01:14:47] Gerard Donnelly: Ironman, Chattanooga, yeah.
[01:14:49] Gerard Donnelly: Next week?
[01:14:50] Gerard Donnelly: Yeah, I guess it's...
[01:14:52] Abby Jorgensen: Jesus.
[01:14:53] Abby Jorgensen: So, yeah, he's been dealing with a foot injury, but he got, he went to the doctor.
[01:14:57] Abby Jorgensen: And there's nothing wrong.
[01:15:02] Abby Jorgensen: There's no whatever's there.
[01:15:04] Abby Jorgensen: It's not there anymore.
[01:15:06] Abby Jorgensen: So the doctors are like, you can run.
[01:15:09] Abby Jorgensen: So he kind of wants to take it, you know, cautiously the next couple of weeks so that he can run.
[01:15:17] Gerard Donnelly: His bike has been amazing.
[01:15:18] Abby Jorgensen: If you look at his bike on Saturday, it was, he's like, I just had the best bike of my career.
[01:15:26] Abby Jorgensen: But Where does he live?
[01:15:35] Abby Jorgensen: On the coast of North Carolina.
[01:15:37] Abby Jorgensen: Oh, wow.
[01:15:39] Gerard Donnelly: Carolina.
[01:15:39] Gerard Donnelly: I can't, I get him.
[01:15:41] Gerard Donnelly: Jeez, that's great, Abby.
[01:15:44] Abby Jorgensen: Yeah, he had a really good bike.
[01:15:48] Abby Jorgensen: So his goal is kind of like, he obviously realizes that the run isn't going to be as good as it could have been.
[01:15:55] Abby Jorgensen: So he really wants to push the bike a little bit.
[01:15:59] Abby Jorgensen: You have to have the same conversation, you know.
[01:16:01] Gerard Donnelly: have guess should time earlier.
[01:16:01] Gerard Donnelly: what he's It's
[01:16:02] Gerard Donnelly: So if you can't run, do you want to, if you injure your foot, you've got to be careful what you're doing here.
[01:16:11] Gerard Donnelly: So it sounds like plantar fasciitis.
[01:16:14] Gerard Donnelly: Is it on his foot or?
[01:16:17] Gerard Donnelly: Yeah, I don't know.
[01:16:17] Gerard Donnelly: He said it was more on the top of the foot or like in the toe.
[01:16:21] Abby Jorgensen: Okay.
[01:16:22] Gerard Donnelly: Is that x-ray?
[01:16:23] Gerard Donnelly: Yeah, yeah, x-rays.
[01:16:25] Gerard Donnelly: Nothing.
[01:16:27] Gerard Donnelly: Nope.
[01:16:28] Abby Jorgensen: He said if it was there, it's healed, they said.
[01:16:31] Gerard Donnelly: So yeah, but he doesn't want to run between now and race days that he wants to take it.
[01:16:38] Abby Jorgensen: Like if he does, he doesn't want to like do anything major.
[01:16:42] Abby Jorgensen: Like what?
[01:16:42] Abby Jorgensen: What's it like walking around Abby?
[01:16:44] Gerard Donnelly: Is it no pain?
[01:16:46] Gerard Donnelly: Yeah, no pain.
[01:16:47] Gerard Donnelly: And if has he done a 30 second jog, has he done any jogging?
[01:16:52] Gerard Donnelly: Yeah.
[01:16:53] Abby Jorgensen: If you look back a couple or last week, not running.
[01:17:00] Abby Jorgensen: He had run and then he was like, it feels.
[01:17:02] Abby Jorgensen: It's good, and I should do more, but I don't want to try to piss it off, so.
[01:17:10] Abby Jorgensen: So he's done one run there.
[01:17:11] Gerard Donnelly: Yeah, he says everything feels fine.
[01:17:14] Abby Jorgensen: He just doesn't want to.
[01:17:17] Gerard Donnelly: Yeah, okay.
[01:17:19] Gerard Donnelly: He wants to get to the start line, he says.
[01:17:24] Gerard Donnelly: Foot is still an issue.
[01:17:28] Gerard Donnelly: It hurts, but nothing compared to four weeks ago.
[01:17:30] Gerard Donnelly: I kind of wanted to keep running, but then I thought how coach would react, so I decided to stop.
[01:17:38] Gerard Donnelly: And he went to the doctor the next day.
[01:17:40] Gerard Donnelly: Yep.
[01:17:42] Gerard Donnelly: And the doctor said nothing here, nothing to say here.
[01:17:46] Gerard Donnelly: Yeah.
[01:17:47] Abby Jorgensen: They were like, you can run.
[01:17:50] Abby Jorgensen: Yep.
[01:17:53] Gerard Donnelly: Well, I would be encouraging him to do a bit of walking so that he's not just riding and swimming.
[01:17:59] Gerard Donnelly: Okay.
[01:18:00] Gerard Donnelly: Hi.
[01:18:01] Gerard Donnelly: Vira.
[01:18:01] Gerard Donnelly: Yeah.
[01:18:02] Gerard Donnelly: Yeah.
[01:18:02] Gerard Donnelly: Well, Yeah.
[01:18:02] Gerard Donnelly: Yeah.
[01:18:03] Gerard Donnelly: I think he just needs the action, you know, and if it starts to be painful walking, Abby, you'd have to say to him, you know, what is the purpose of doing an Ironman except for the fact that you've paid for it and your travel and your accommodations are all booked, but if you end up with a stress fracture or something on your toe, it could put you out for six months, you know, are you happy to have that consequence?
[01:18:32] Gerard Donnelly: They're the questions you have to ask beforehand, you know, so that they're making the decision, but you're making them aware of the consequences.
[01:18:46] Gerard Donnelly: Yeah, there's going to be other events, you know, you can still ride and swim and not run at all.
[01:18:51] Gerard Donnelly: It's not what you want, I know, but we're here to protect you.
[01:18:55] Gerard Donnelly: We're looking after your health and well-being.
[01:18:56] Gerard Donnelly: That's actually how you have to come from that point of view.
[01:19:01] Gerard Donnelly: Yeah.
[01:19:02] Gerard Donnelly: Yeah.
[01:19:02] Gerard Donnelly: Yeah.
[01:19:02] Abby Jorgensen: I was just afraid that even if something was healed and he had one at one point, like even trying to run a marathon would probably just make it worse or like bring it back.
[01:19:14] Gerard Donnelly: That's the only outcome.
[01:19:15] Gerard Donnelly: It's no different to Cindy.
[01:19:17] Gerard Donnelly: We don't repeat the same thing, you know.
[01:19:21] Gerard Donnelly: When I very first started coaching 20 years ago, I was always letting the athlete go, oh, yeah, okay, let's see.
[01:19:26] Gerard Donnelly: Then they got injured and they were really angry, you know.
[01:19:30] Gerard Donnelly: And I'd say, yeah, well, we talked about that.
[01:19:33] Gerard Donnelly: And we didn't really talk about it like this, you know.
[01:19:36] Gerard Donnelly: You didn't have me saying, hey, Abby, I don't think you should be doing this run.
[01:19:41] Gerard Donnelly: I think you should be doing the swim and bike because I'm caring about your longevity here.
[01:19:45] Gerard Donnelly: And I don't think that if you did this run, anything but an injury is going to – that's the only outcome here I can see.
[01:19:52] Gerard Donnelly: You're going to have severe injury that could derail you for the next six months.
[01:19:56] Gerard Donnelly: And as long as you understand that, then you can make the decision either way.
[01:20:01] Gerard Donnelly: But my advice – Thank
[01:20:02] Gerard Donnelly: It would be not to run if you're worried it's going to make it worse.
[01:20:08] Gerard Donnelly: And that's what we have to say out loud beforehand.
[01:20:12] Gerard Donnelly: That's a tough conversation to have.
[01:20:16] Gerard Donnelly: But I had to do it twice last week for two different races, one in Australia and one in Germany.
[01:20:21] Gerard Donnelly: And I forced them to not run.
[01:20:25] Gerard Donnelly: And afterwards, now they're very happy.
[01:20:27] Gerard Donnelly: They're not injured.
[01:20:30] Gerard Donnelly: One of them is doing Marbella and the other one is doing December race.
[01:20:36] Gerard Donnelly: And they're both able to do those races now.
[01:20:39] Gerard Donnelly: Whereas if they had to run, it would have been a risk.
[01:20:42] Gerard Donnelly: We don't know whether they could do those races because that's what we're here for, is to give them the right advice and then try and steer them to what we think.
[01:20:52] Gerard Donnelly: And if they still want to, and they're adamant that they want to do it, then the only thing you can say is, well, we've discussed it, William.
[01:20:59] Gerard Donnelly: We've discussed the consequences, as long as you're aware of that.
[01:21:02] Gerard Donnelly: I'm happy to be on board with whatever you want to do, but you have to understand this is what we think.
[01:21:09] Abby Jorgensen: Okay.
[01:21:10] Abby Jorgensen: And imagine if I said that to you and you were injured.
[01:21:11] Gerard Donnelly: You'd be just going, oh, this sucks.
[01:21:13] Gerard Donnelly: You know, I want to do the race.
[01:21:15] Gerard Donnelly: Yeah.
[01:21:16] Gerard Donnelly: But you need someone in your corner to say, hey, Abby, is this a really good thing to do, you know, to potentially injure yourself more?
[01:21:26] Gerard Donnelly: You would want me to say that to you.
[01:21:29] Gerard Donnelly: You know, you'd want me to act like a herring parent.
[01:21:33] Gerard Donnelly: That's actually what you're trying to do.
[01:21:35] Gerard Donnelly: You you don't want to see your child injured.
[01:21:40] Gerard Donnelly: So, and that's the truth.
[01:21:41] Gerard Donnelly: You're trying to protect them from hurting themselves.
[01:21:44] Gerard Donnelly: And you've got to point out what's the purpose if you can't run the way you want to.
[01:21:49] Gerard Donnelly: You're not going to get the time you want and you're possibly going to make it worse.
[01:21:54] Gerard Donnelly: So, get in there and have a really hard swim and ride and smash that bike and, you know, that's what your goal is.
[01:22:01] Gerard Donnelly: It's, it's better.
[01:22:02] Gerard Donnelly: No grace at all, you know.
[01:22:04] Gerard Donnelly: If they're still adamant they want to go to the event and compete, well, you know, get them to ride the house down at a training session for the next time they do it.
[01:22:15] Gerard Donnelly: But that's option B.
[01:22:19] Gerard Donnelly: Option A is not do it.
[01:22:20] Gerard Donnelly: Option B is do swim and bike.
[01:22:22] Gerard Donnelly: Option C is do swim, bike, and run and suffer the consequences.
[01:22:27] Gerard Donnelly: Okay?
[01:22:28] Gerard Donnelly: Yep.
[01:22:30] Gerard Donnelly: All right.
[01:22:31] Gerard Donnelly: I better shoot.
[01:22:31] Gerard Donnelly: Sorry.
[01:22:32] Gerard Donnelly: No, you're fine.
[01:22:34] Gerard Donnelly: Okay.
[01:22:34] Gerard Donnelly: Just yell out, as usual, if you've got any questions with anybody.
[01:22:38] Gerard Donnelly: And I'll try to get Michael going.
[01:22:43] Gerard Donnelly: Yeah.
[01:22:44] Abby Jorgensen: I was going to email Floyd in because I didn't know, like, if I should have had his information or not.
[01:22:51] Gerard Donnelly: Yeah, I would email Floyd in just because I've got a call in a minute, so I'd email her now.
[01:22:57] Gerard Donnelly: Okay.
[01:22:57] Gerard Donnelly: Yep.
[01:22:58] Gerard Donnelly: Okay.
[01:22:58] Gerard Donnelly: All right.
[01:22:59] Gerard Donnelly: And CC Jordan in that too, please.
[01:23:01] Gerard Donnelly: Okay.
[01:23:02] Gerard Donnelly: All right.
[01:23:02] Gerard Donnelly: Yeah, okay.
[01:23:03] Gerard Donnelly: Bye.
[01:23:39] Gerard Donnelly: Thank you.
[01:24:06] Gerard Donnelly: Thank you.
[01:24:33] Gerard Donnelly: Thank
[01:26:10] Gerard Donnelly: Thank you.
[01:26:39] Gerard Donnelly: Thank you.
[01:27:19] Gerard Donnelly: That's a fantastic way to put the light.
[01:27:21] Gerard Donnelly: You have to pinch yourself the way you're going.
[01:27:35] Gerard Donnelly: I'm always trying to find out where I can do a bit better, but I need to cherish these.
[01:27:43] Gerard Donnelly: That's a fair and reasonable response, everything you're saying.
[01:27:47] Gerard Donnelly: Yeah.
[01:27:50] Gerard Donnelly: You want to just find out, you know, was I riding with my brakes on, you know?
[01:27:56] Gerard Donnelly: Yeah.
[01:27:58] Gerard Donnelly: You're just never going to know, really.
[01:27:59] Gerard Donnelly: even.
[01:28:00] Gerard Donnelly: No.
[01:28:01] Gerard Donnelly: And then also, I…
[01:28:04] Gerard Donnelly: And maybe I was a little bit, yeah, run-wise, I'm still running so much better than I ever have.
[01:28:13] Gerard Donnelly: And that's a hard run across the hills.
[01:28:16] Gerard Donnelly: agree.
[01:28:18] Gerard Donnelly: It's not the easiest half marathon to run.
[01:28:21] Gerard Donnelly: And look, the pro times tell you that too.
[01:28:23] Gerard Donnelly: There's very few guys who ran fast, you know.
[01:28:27] Gerard Donnelly: Yeah.
[01:28:28] Gerard Donnelly: You know, when you see Tom, you know, running a high 115 and Ron, what did he run, 117?
[01:28:37] Gerard Donnelly: Yeah.
[01:28:38] Gerard Donnelly: You know, they're in good form, you know.
[01:28:43] Gerard Donnelly: And you're not that far behind, so.
[01:28:46] Gerard Donnelly: What was really, my swim,  hell.
[01:28:50] Gerard Donnelly: Like that's brilliant, but it's really good to know that my swim is where it is.
[01:28:55] Gerard Donnelly: And I think what it was was that I, my sighting was just probably a lot better off than, I think, slung running a shorter distance.
[01:29:02] Gerard Donnelly: Distances, very direct, yeah.
[01:29:06] Gerard Donnelly: So, but, yeah, I know, as much as I don't like my legs, I just know that I'll probably try and do a little bit of Zone 1 this morning and Masaba.
[01:29:16] Gerard Donnelly: I just need to get some blood to my legs.
[01:29:18] Gerard Donnelly: That's fine, mate.
[01:29:19] Gerard Donnelly: Yeah.
[01:29:20] Gerard Donnelly: But you've got to really take it easy this week.
[01:29:23] Gerard Donnelly: Yeah.
[01:29:24] Gerard Donnelly: You know, the desire is to, let's go, but no.
[01:29:28] Gerard Donnelly: Yeah.
[01:29:30] Gerard Donnelly: You know, yeah.
[01:29:33] Gerard Donnelly: I'm lucky I can have a sick day today.
[01:29:35] Gerard Donnelly: Like, I'm just going to ride or hide this on Striva.
[01:29:38] Gerard Donnelly: Yeah.
[01:29:38] Gerard Donnelly: I'm going to feel and then have a little sleep.
[01:29:42] Gerard Donnelly: And, yeah, yeah, I know this is really recovery and just let my legs go over.
[01:29:50] Gerard Donnelly: It's Thursday's run, you know, just really doesn't have to be 50 minutes.
[01:29:55] Gerard Donnelly: It be whatever, mate.
[01:29:56] Gerard Donnelly: It can be 30 minutes.
[01:29:57] Gerard Donnelly: Just if your legs are still sore by then.
[01:29:59] Gerard Donnelly: You should get to see Nana if you can.
[01:30:00] Gerard Donnelly: And I don't know, it's very difficult with work.
[01:30:02] Gerard Donnelly: I
[01:30:03] Gerard Donnelly: Well, it's not with my days off, so I might go there on Thursday.
[01:30:07] Gerard Donnelly: Yeah, I would.
[01:30:08] Gerard Donnelly: Just ring her up.
[01:30:09] Gerard Donnelly: Yeah, yeah.
[01:30:11] Gerard Donnelly: And, yeah, that'll be really good.
[01:30:16] Gerard Donnelly: Actually, I might message her on Thursday.
[01:30:19] Gerard Donnelly: So, was Stevie back happy?
[01:30:21] Gerard Donnelly: I haven't yet to talk to him.
[01:30:24] Gerard Donnelly: He should be happy running at 2.59, but he was in the medical tent with three IVs at the end.
[01:30:35] Gerard Donnelly: That's the only bit of info I've got from him.
[01:30:39] Gerard Donnelly: So I've left a voice message for him.
[01:30:42] Gerard Donnelly: We had a funeral yesterday, unfortunately.
[01:30:44] Gerard Donnelly: So there was Andy's Uncle John, who's been such an impactful guy in our kids' lives.
[01:30:54] Gerard Donnelly: Liam, Matt, Jordan and George's lives.
[01:30:57] Gerard Donnelly: And he was like their grandfather.
[01:31:00] Gerard Donnelly: Ironically, Andy's mother.
[01:31:02] Gerard Donnelly: My are here now, Jordan's grandparents, and it was kind of, yeah, it was sad, but yeah, fantastic life.
[01:31:13] Gerard Donnelly: Really, you know, physically fit guy, really loved exercise, you know, just fell over and, you know, that was the end of it.
[01:31:23] Gerard Donnelly: Oh, , okay.
[01:31:23] Gerard Donnelly: Yeah, yeah, so I didn't get a chance to talk to Stevie yesterday, because I was at the bloody funeral from four o'clock till nine o'clock last night, and by the time I got home, was like too late, so.
[01:31:36] Gerard Donnelly: Yeah.
[01:31:37] Gerard Donnelly: But yeah, I sent him a message straight after the race saying, you know, it was great watching him, you know, I was watching kilometre by kilometre.
[01:31:43] Gerard Donnelly: I went to bed at 2 a.m.
[01:31:45] Gerard Donnelly: Yeah, yeah.
[01:31:48] Gerard Donnelly: But yeah, I was, there's something not right about his bike, like he's ridden way better than that, every training session way better than that.
[01:31:57] Gerard Donnelly: You've seen his training sessions as well.
[01:31:59] Gerard Donnelly: Yeah, yeah, yeah, 100%.
[01:32:00] Gerard Donnelly: He said, he just said he didn't feel good on the bike.
[01:32:02] Gerard Donnelly: Which is surprising.
[01:32:05] Gerard Donnelly: Had he ridden normally, he would have won.
[01:32:08] Gerard Donnelly: He was so far back, mate, and he got off the bike 12th, and he ended up losing 5th place by 20 seconds and 4th place by 50, and he was only 2 minutes off the podium and 4 minutes off the win.
[01:32:23] Gerard Donnelly: So had he ridden normally, it was a moment that got away.
[01:32:28] Gerard Donnelly: can't believe what he's a bit.
[01:32:30] Gerard Donnelly: It's not like he had to buy it, because he wouldn't have been able to run like that, would he?
[01:32:34] Gerard Donnelly: That's right.
[01:32:35] Gerard Donnelly: So something, yeah, okay.
[01:32:38] Gerard Donnelly: It'd be really interesting to hear from him as well, because Marbella has got a lot of similarities.
[01:32:45] Gerard Donnelly: Yes, it has, yeah.
[01:32:48] Gerard Donnelly: If you could go again, what would you do differently in your prep for that, like was it the descent or?
[01:32:55] Gerard Donnelly: Yeah, he's got all that covered.
[01:32:58] Gerard Donnelly: He's just the all-round good rider.
[01:33:01] Gerard Donnelly: Yeah.
[01:33:02] Gerard Donnelly: I was surprised.
[01:33:04] Gerard Donnelly: Yeah.
[01:33:05] Gerard Donnelly: There was one stage the tracker stopped for about 10 minutes.
[01:33:08] Gerard Donnelly: I thought he'd crash.
[01:33:09] Gerard Donnelly: No.
[01:33:10] Gerard Donnelly: I couldn't work out what was going on.
[01:33:12] Gerard Donnelly: I thought that was what's causing the problem.
[01:33:14] Gerard Donnelly: Then he got off and he seemed to ride after that okay.
[01:33:17] Gerard Donnelly: was catching back up again because he was catching up and then he wasn't.
[01:33:21] Gerard Donnelly: Yeah.
[01:33:21] Gerard Donnelly: It didn't make sense on the track.
[01:33:22] Gerard Donnelly: It's so frustrating.
[01:33:24] Gerard Donnelly: Yeah.
[01:33:26] Gerard Donnelly: You have those periods of anxiety of not actually knowing what's going on when the tracker does that.
[01:33:32] Gerard Donnelly: Now, mate, I've got a call in six minutes for a new athlete.
[01:33:36] Gerard Donnelly: I also want to talk to you about, what's her name?
[01:33:41] Gerard Donnelly: Buddy Sarah Goodyear.
[01:33:44] Gerard Donnelly: Yep.
[01:33:45] Gerard Donnelly: Did you see her on the weekend?
[01:33:47] Gerard Donnelly: No, she congratulated me after in messages, but no, I didn't see her at the race.
[01:33:52] Gerard Donnelly: So, but yeah, well, we've got, as I said, to Maurice, let me know.
[01:33:58] Gerard Donnelly: I'm glad I got today.
[01:33:59] Gerard Donnelly: thought I was going to do a little reset and get stuck back into it.
[01:34:03] Gerard Donnelly: Tomorrow, it'll be a busy couple of weeks.
[01:34:05] Gerard Donnelly: I've got like five, probably six race, toast race and hours.
