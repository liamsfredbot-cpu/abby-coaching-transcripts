## Transcript

[00:00:00] Abby Jorgensen: How are you doing?
[00:00:01] Abby Jorgensen: Good, how are you?
[00:00:03] Abby Jorgensen: Good.
[00:00:05] Gerard Donnelly: You still got snow?
[00:00:07] Gerard Donnelly: Oh, yeah.
[00:00:08] Abby Jorgensen: We've had more snow in the last, like, three weeks than we had all of last year.
[00:00:14] Abby Jorgensen: Wow.
[00:00:16] Abby Jorgensen: So, yeah, it was a negative 28 Celsius wind chill yesterday morning.
[00:00:22] Abby Jorgensen: That's impossible to go outside, is it?
[00:00:25] Abby Jorgensen: I mean, yeah, you can go outside, but not for long.
[00:00:29] Abby Jorgensen: Yeah.
[00:00:30] Abby Jorgensen: Yeah.
[00:00:31] Gerard Donnelly: So, do you just jump in your car and then go to work and then, is that how you do it?
[00:00:37] Abby Jorgensen: How do you do it?
[00:00:38] Abby Jorgensen: I mean, it was Sunday, so luckily we didn't have any place to go.
[00:00:43] Abby Jorgensen: I went to my friend's house and went and asked.
[00:00:45] Gerard Donnelly: What about on the days where you have to work if it's that temperature?
[00:00:49] Abby Jorgensen: Yeah, I mean, I have remote start, so I can start my car and go.
[00:00:55] Abby Jorgensen: I mean, you can go out there, you just have to bundle up.
[00:00:58] Abby Jorgensen: Yeah.
[00:00:58] Abby Jorgensen: But it's not, yeah.
[00:00:59] Abby Jorgensen: I think they say it, like, takes 10 minutes for frostbite to set in about that temperature.
[00:01:06] Gerard Donnelly: But everybody gets on with it.
[00:01:08] Gerard Donnelly: Yeah, and it's normal for us, I guess, this time of year.
[00:01:13] Gerard Donnelly: Crazy, isn't it?
[00:01:14] Abby Jorgensen: Yeah, it's really early this year, too, because, I mean, it's usually January before any of this stuff hits, so.
[00:01:23] Abby Jorgensen: Does that mean it's going to be a longer period?
[00:01:25] Abby Jorgensen: I mean, hopefully not, but probably.
[00:01:28] Abby Jorgensen: Yeah.
[00:01:29] Abby Jorgensen: Yeah.
[00:01:30] Gerard Donnelly: Well done on your week.
[00:01:32] Gerard Donnelly: That was really good.
[00:01:33] Gerard Donnelly: Thank you.
[00:01:34] Abby Jorgensen: Yeah, I did not expect to come close to my FTP, but I did.
[00:01:40] Gerard Donnelly: It's another example, Abby, because you started so conservatively, it allowed you to do that, you know.
[00:01:49] Gerard Donnelly: If you're trying to ride, you know, straight up at that two, sorry, at that 190 straight up, you know, you can't put yourself under the pump.
[00:01:59] Gerard Donnelly: and it's step Okay.
[00:01:59] Gerard Donnelly: Thank
[00:02:00] Gerard Donnelly: Um, but starting at the 187 was really well done.
[00:02:06] Gerard Donnelly: Um, and then not moving up too quick.
[00:02:08] Gerard Donnelly: I mean, you, you know, your first 10 minutes was 188.
[00:02:11] Gerard Donnelly: Then you ended up at 206, which is, you know, because you're starting like that and don't underestimate how good your cardiovascular system is from your running.
[00:02:22] Gerard Donnelly: Yeah, that's what I'm figuring out pretty quickly.
[00:02:26] Abby Jorgensen: Yeah, they both help each other.
[00:02:27] Gerard Donnelly: So, you know, all the riding we do with intensity, which you're not doing a lot of, you're doing one a week, but if it's a reverse, it really still helps your running, you know, and if, if you're doing a lot of aerobic running, it really helps your riding still.
[00:02:41] Gerard Donnelly: Um, so the fact that you're maintaining, it's great.
[00:02:45] Gerard Donnelly: Yeah, I'll take that.
[00:02:47] Abby Jorgensen: Yeah, absolutely.
[00:02:48] Gerard Donnelly: And your swim wasn't too bad either.
[00:02:50] Gerard Donnelly: No, it was like, what, 10, 20 seconds or something?
[00:02:53] Abby Jorgensen: 10 seconds.
[00:02:54] Gerard Donnelly: you're basically, you know, within one second per, per hundred yards, per hundred.
[00:02:59] Gerard Donnelly: Yeah.
[00:02:59] Gerard Donnelly: Yeah, 100 yards.
[00:03:01] Gerard Donnelly: So, yeah, that's fine.
[00:03:03] Gerard Donnelly: We're not trying to swim, but it's good for you to do a threshold swim for 17 minutes.
[00:03:10] Gerard Donnelly: Good for your lungs and your brain to have to concentrate.
[00:03:14] Gerard Donnelly: They're the things that it's good for.
[00:03:16] Gerard Donnelly: Yeah.
[00:03:18] Abby Jorgensen: I like swimming once in a while, too.
[00:03:20] Abby Jorgensen: I feel like it helps downregulate the nervous system a little bit, too.
[00:03:23] Abby Jorgensen: Yeah, yeah.
[00:03:24] Gerard Donnelly: And, you know, you're still exercising without impacting the legs.
[00:03:29] Gerard Donnelly: You're floating.
[00:03:31] Gerard Donnelly: How did you feel you cope with the run?
[00:03:36] Abby Jorgensen: Pretty well.
[00:03:37] Abby Jorgensen: mean, I think, like, yesterday, my hamstrings and calves were sore.
[00:03:42] Abby Jorgensen: So I think with all the incline and stuff that I did, it might have affected that a little bit more.
[00:03:47] Abby Jorgensen: But, yeah, considering, like, doing those speeds on a treadmill usually feels pretty hard inside for that long.
[00:03:57] Abby Jorgensen: I was surprised, you know.
[00:03:59] Abby Jorgensen: But I was able to maintain.
[00:04:01] Abby Jorgensen: Yeah, you finished off really strong.
[00:04:04] Gerard Donnelly: know, that 437 pace, that's really good.
[00:04:07] Gerard Donnelly: If this treadmill is telling us the right pace.
[00:04:10] Abby Jorgensen: it was eight, over, right around eight miles an hour or whatever and over.
[00:04:16] Abby Jorgensen: So I think I had it figured out based off of a chart I look at of what speeds I needed to try to be at.
[00:04:23] Gerard Donnelly: Yeah, I think you did a great job.
[00:04:24] Gerard Donnelly: And your heart rate, you know, you got up to 179, which was, you know, it only did that when you were picking it up, you know, at the end.
[00:04:32] Gerard Donnelly: Most of the time you're in the 160s.
[00:04:36] Gerard Donnelly: So, yeah, I think if we want to try and run longer during this period, Abby, we have to do a split run.
[00:04:42] Gerard Donnelly: I don't see this as being, this is an injury risk waiting to happen if I run too long on the treadmill.
[00:04:50] Abby Jorgensen: Hopefully, I mean, this week's supposed to warm up.
[00:04:53] Abby Jorgensen: I mean, warm up by 30 degrees Fahrenheit.
[00:04:56] Abby Jorgensen: Yeah.
[00:04:56] Abby Jorgensen: So it might be doable at some point here.
[00:04:59] Abby Jorgensen: So
[00:05:00] Gerard Donnelly: Yeah, well, the primary goal would be for you to run outside continuously for the two, two and a half hours, but if you have to run inside, I would be happy for you to swap days, you know, whatever the day that's the warmest, but if you can't get outside, I don't want you running two hours 15 straight.
[00:05:20] Gerard Donnelly: I would rather you ran, you know, maybe an hour and a 15 or an hour and a half in the morning and then, you know, half an hour in the afternoon or, so you've got a break.
[00:05:34] Gerard Donnelly: So you still get two hours on the day, but not straight.
[00:05:42] Gerard Donnelly: Yeah, it's a long time.
[00:05:44] Abby Jorgensen: A bit of a battle, I think.
[00:05:46] Gerard Donnelly: Good thing I have a TV.
[00:05:49] Gerard Donnelly: Yeah.
[00:05:51] Gerard Donnelly: It's, uh, I just can't imagine running on a treadmill the whole time, so, um, anyway, plenty of people do it, so.
[00:05:59] Gerard Donnelly: Yeah, I mean.
[00:06:00] Abby Jorgensen: Doing the inclines and having some sort of variation helps.
[00:06:03] Abby Jorgensen: Yes.
[00:06:04] Abby Jorgensen: That's the time a little better.
[00:06:06] Abby Jorgensen: Yeah, that's what we need.
[00:06:07] Gerard Donnelly: Even the steady state, you know, I'm trying to get you to run reasonably slow, but at least if you're doing 10-minute efforts, you know, and then you're doing two-minute efforts, then you're doing six-minute efforts.
[00:06:16] Gerard Donnelly: So it's a huge variety.
[00:06:18] Gerard Donnelly: It's just the continuous running.
[00:06:20] Gerard Donnelly: Those are what we need.
[00:06:21] Gerard Donnelly: We need days where you're running continuously, but not landing on the same spot every step is, you know, for people who are injured, it's great.
[00:06:30] Gerard Donnelly: It protects them, but for people who need the variation of landing so you can, you know, make the ankle tendons and ligaments really stronger, the triathlon is bad to that.
[00:06:42] Gerard Donnelly: It's overuse of the same action.
[00:06:47] Gerard Donnelly: There's nothing you can do.
[00:06:49] Abby Jorgensen: Yeah, unfortunately.
[00:06:51] Abby Jorgensen: Yeah.
[00:06:52] Abby Jorgensen: Like it just, it'll melt and then refreeze and then melt, refreeze, and then we'll get another snow and then it's just.
[00:06:58] Abby Jorgensen: Yep.
[00:06:59] Abby Jorgensen: Yep.
[00:06:59] Abby Jorgensen: Yep.
[00:07:00] Gerard Donnelly: So I just want to make sure that you know what to do when you're faced each day with the situation you're in.
[00:07:06] Gerard Donnelly: The goal is outside every time, but if that's impractical, then don't try that.
[00:07:13] Gerard Donnelly: Okay?
[00:07:14] Gerard Donnelly: Yep.
[00:07:15] Gerard Donnelly: And we can always throw in a little bit more intensity on a bike session anywhere in the week to give you some variety with some intensity.
[00:07:25] Gerard Donnelly: Okay?
[00:07:26] Gerard Donnelly: Okay.
[00:07:28] Abby Jorgensen: I mean, yeah, I have time, so.
[00:07:33] Gerard Donnelly: So how are you going with everything?
[00:07:35] Gerard Donnelly: How's work and coaching?
[00:07:41] Abby Jorgensen: Yeah, coaching at a gym, only like six hours a week.
[00:07:44] Abby Jorgensen: So it's just enough that gets me interacting with people and things like that.
[00:07:50] Abby Jorgensen: And then just doing like one afternoon a week at the dog place.
[00:07:55] Abby Jorgensen: So other than that, I'm pretty, pretty much.
[00:07:59] Abby Jorgensen: Yeah.
[00:08:00] Abby Jorgensen: I'm open most days.
[00:08:02] Abby Jorgensen: Fantastic.
[00:08:04] Gerard Donnelly: With the triathlon coaching, are you feeling a bit overwhelmed?
[00:08:10] Gerard Donnelly: Tell me how you're coping with that.
[00:08:12] Abby Jorgensen: No, I mean, I feel like I found a good balance because especially now with my schedule, like I'll coach nine or noon.
[00:08:19] Abby Jorgensen: And then, I mean, every day I try to just look through everybody's thing.
[00:08:24] Abby Jorgensen: If I need to shoot a text or something real quick, I do that.
[00:08:27] Abby Jorgensen: So it's been a pretty good.
[00:08:30] Abby Jorgensen: Like system, I think I've put in place.
[00:08:32] Abby Jorgensen: Yep.
[00:08:33] Gerard Donnelly: I'm just pushing for you to get more athletes as much as I can.
[00:08:41] Gerard Donnelly: And it's good that you've, I mean, you've really started quite a few people.
[00:08:44] Gerard Donnelly: Sin, Mario, Chris, Albert, and Scott's next.
[00:08:48] Gerard Donnelly: Yep.
[00:08:50] Gerard Donnelly: Once you get all the information for Scott, he's ready to go.
[00:08:53] Abby Jorgensen: Okay.
[00:08:54] Gerard Donnelly: Hopefully, Abby will send that to you.
[00:08:56] Gerard Donnelly: Yeah.
[00:08:56] Gerard Donnelly: I hope Neil sent that to you.
[00:08:59] Gerard Donnelly: Um, you.
[00:09:00] Abby Jorgensen: Yeah, I just talked to Albert today.
[00:09:03] Abby Jorgensen: I mean, talked to him over the weekend, but he's working, but we face-to-face today.
[00:09:07] Abby Jorgensen: We got everything going, so.
[00:09:09] Gerard Donnelly: Yeah, he's pretty keen, so that's good.
[00:09:14] Gerard Donnelly: And his schedule where he works 12-hour shifts on Friday, Saturday, Sunday is going to be a little bit limiting, but, you know.
[00:09:22] Abby Jorgensen: He said Sunday is kind of like a Friday for him, so we'll try to make Sundays work, and then he said Fridays are hard because the traffic, so it takes him an hour to get to work and an hour to get home from work, so that kind of makes it a 14-hour day at that point.
[00:09:39] Abby Jorgensen: Yeah, it's going to be a bit tricky.
[00:09:44] Gerard Donnelly: But that changes, I think, soon.
[00:09:48] Gerard Donnelly: So, from memory, that's not going to be ongoing.
[00:09:53] Gerard Donnelly: I think he starts a new job.
[00:09:56] Gerard Donnelly: I can't remember exactly.
[00:09:58] Gerard Donnelly: Yeah, he didn't say anything.
[00:10:00] Abby Jorgensen: I about that, but you just said in the summertime it's easier too because it's lighter out later to do stuff outside.
[00:10:07] Abby Jorgensen: Yep.
[00:10:11] Gerard Donnelly: Scott, once you listen to the recording, he's someone who's just going to need the tiniest program.
[00:10:20] Gerard Donnelly: know, like he's had two years where he trains, in his words, he trains himself too hard, then has two months off and then trains too hard.
[00:10:33] Gerard Donnelly: And when I ask him about what he's doing, it's really for you and I, it's like three hours of training a week.
[00:10:43] Gerard Donnelly: So, so his, his mindset is, I just want, I don't care about my race results.
[00:10:49] Gerard Donnelly: I just want to be able to train for the next two years without having this high low.
[00:10:54] Gerard Donnelly: And I said, great, that's how we'll coach you.
[00:10:57] Gerard Donnelly: And, and, you know.
[00:11:00] Gerard Donnelly: We'll just take it easy with the sessions and there's less pressure because we're all about improving performance where he just wants to be able to train every week and he'll still improve because he's got consistency.
[00:11:17] Gerard Donnelly: Yeah.
[00:11:18] Gerard Donnelly: And he just wants to be able to communicate, which is you're perfect for this, you know, and he wants someone to hear that he's tired and then adjust.
[00:11:31] Gerard Donnelly: And that's straightforward for you.
[00:11:33] Gerard Donnelly: It's easy, you know, and it's okay to have days off, Abby, just have a session day off, session day off if you want to.
[00:11:42] Gerard Donnelly: But yeah, just make everything really, I said, we'll test him at the start, see where his numbers are and then, and then, yeah, I'm happy to discuss the program with him.
[00:11:52] Gerard Donnelly: Once you've listened, you'll understand what I'm saying.
[00:11:55] Abby Jorgensen: Well, maybe not like starting off with like high intensity VO2 work or.
[00:12:00] Gerard Donnelly: I think I said to him, look, one session a week, high intensity structure is really going to help you improve rather than you just staying the same athlete.
[00:12:12] Gerard Donnelly: And he still wants improvement, but he's not, that's not what his main goal is.
[00:12:17] Abby Jorgensen: Okay.
[00:12:19] Gerard Donnelly: So even in sedentary, you know, not athletes, sedentary humans who have been told to do some sort of exercise for their health, that even the studies show that doing one VO2 session per week, you know, it can be as simple as three sets of five by 30 or two sets of five by 30 where you're just really just revving your legs.
[00:12:45] Gerard Donnelly: That's, that's, going to be more beneficial than you're just doing steady state walking.
[00:12:51] Gerard Donnelly: So kind of look at anything like that.
[00:12:55] Gerard Donnelly: It's a little bit weird, but, but that's.
[00:12:59] Abby Jorgensen: Yeah.
[00:13:00] Abby Jorgensen: Yeah, that's where he's at.
[00:13:03] Gerard Donnelly: But, yeah, hopefully that happens today because he's a bit of a particular guy, I think.
[00:13:09] Gerard Donnelly: And he filled in all the forms within four hours of a phone call finishing.
[00:13:16] Abby Jorgensen: So, but it was a lot.
[00:13:17] Gerard Donnelly: I interviewed him on Saturday night.
[00:13:20] Gerard Donnelly: So it was the weekend.
[00:13:22] Gerard Donnelly: It was Saturday morning for him.
[00:13:24] Gerard Donnelly: It was 6 p.m.
[00:13:26] Gerard Donnelly: Saturday night for me.
[00:13:26] Gerard Donnelly: So I'm saying to him, look, no one's in the office.
[00:13:29] Gerard Donnelly: So, you know, we'll get you going on Monday.
[00:13:33] Gerard Donnelly: So anyway, he's already had Monday.
[00:13:37] Abby Jorgensen: Got the thing before.
[00:13:38] Abby Jorgensen: That usually doesn't happen.
[00:13:39] Abby Jorgensen: So I was like confused at first.
[00:13:43] Abby Jorgensen: Yes.
[00:13:43] Gerard Donnelly: Just because he clicked the link to TrainingPeaks.
[00:13:47] Gerard Donnelly: So then I just straight away forwarded to you.
[00:13:50] Gerard Donnelly: So I knew you'd be happy there was another athlete coming.
[00:13:52] Gerard Donnelly: Yeah, it's good.
[00:13:54] Gerard Donnelly: Okay, we'll dig into it.
[00:13:56] Gerard Donnelly: Is there anybody who needs more attention, Abby, that you are?
[00:14:01] Abby Jorgensen: No, mean, there's nobody that's really, I mean, everybody's kind of just in this off-season mode, so nobody's, yeah, I mean, there's a couple cases of, you people being sick, and, like, Karen's mom fell, and so she had to go to her, had to go to her parents' place.
[00:14:21] Abby Jorgensen: She took her stuff with her, but she's had a few days off, but other than that, like, there's nothing crazy.
[00:14:30] Gerard Donnelly: She's doing really good, I mean, like, even her outdoor sessions have looked really good.
[00:14:34] Abby Jorgensen: Yeah.
[00:14:36] Gerard Donnelly: So you just added more time for, yeah, two hours.
[00:14:40] Gerard Donnelly: Two hours, fantastic.
[00:14:44] Gerard Donnelly: Oh, yeah, she's getting some great volume, isn't she?
[00:14:47] Gerard Donnelly: Yeah.
[00:14:52] Gerard Donnelly: And this, the fatigue thing is what I'm scared about with her doing two nights.
[00:14:55] Gerard Donnelly: Yeah, this morning, she said she didn't sleep well, so I said...
[00:14:59] Abby Jorgensen: ...
[00:14:59] Abby Jorgensen: ...
[00:14:59] Abby Jorgensen: ...
[00:15:00] Abby Jorgensen: Don't do anything extra today.
[00:15:03] Abby Jorgensen: She messaged me that she feels a lot better this afternoon.
[00:15:06] Abby Jorgensen: Yeah.
[00:15:07] Gerard Donnelly: So she did 330K and 44.
[00:15:11] Gerard Donnelly: That's a big week.
[00:15:13] Gerard Donnelly: Plus nearly 1,000 meters, 10,000 meters of swimming, nearly 10 kilometers of swimming.
[00:15:21] Gerard Donnelly: A 24-hour week, wow.
[00:15:25] Abby Jorgensen: Does that count, like, her strength training and stuff?
[00:15:28] Abby Jorgensen: Yeah, it does, yeah.
[00:15:30] Gerard Donnelly: How did she test?
[00:15:33] Abby Jorgensen: I think she tested, like, it was one of her best 20-minute tests, even indoor or outdoor.
[00:15:42] Abby Jorgensen: She said it was really windy that day, so that didn't help.
[00:15:47] Gerard Donnelly: She still did it in one direction.
[00:15:49] Gerard Donnelly: After all, we tell them.
[00:15:52] Abby Jorgensen: It's kind of weird.
[00:15:53] Abby Jorgensen: What did she put in her notes?
[00:15:56] Abby Jorgensen: Just let me check.
[00:15:59] Gerard Donnelly: Well, she went out for for
[00:16:00] Gerard Donnelly: Oh, she?
[00:16:00] Gerard Donnelly: She went up to climb.
[00:16:04] Abby Jorgensen: No, I think she.
[00:16:10] Gerard Donnelly: Out and back's now option.
[00:16:21] Gerard Donnelly: But that's the whole point of practising.
[00:16:27] Gerard Donnelly: Yeah, anyway, that's all right.
[00:16:35] Gerard Donnelly: So we just tested her for the swim and for the ride?
[00:16:39] Abby Jorgensen: Yeah.
[00:16:40] Abby Jorgensen: Yeah, great.
[00:16:43] Gerard Donnelly: Yeah, all right.
[00:16:44] Gerard Donnelly: So have you given her the same strength session, Abby?
[00:16:55] Gerard Donnelly: Please, session one, and then session...
[00:17:00] Gerard Donnelly: One again?
[00:17:01] Abby Jorgensen: Oh, I meant to go two.
[00:17:04] Abby Jorgensen: Yep, that's okay.
[00:17:10] Gerard Donnelly: I'm going to switch that out.
[00:17:12] Abby Jorgensen: Yep.
[00:17:22] Gerard Donnelly: It's a really good program.
[00:17:26] Gerard Donnelly: Yeah.
[00:17:26] Gerard Donnelly: It's just, you've got to be super careful with the fatigue.
[00:17:30] Abby Jorgensen: Yeah.
[00:17:30] Abby Jorgensen: I mean, I've had that talk every week with her.
[00:17:33] Abby Jorgensen: So hopefully.
[00:17:34] Abby Jorgensen: Yep.
[00:17:34] Gerard Donnelly: We don't want to end up in week three.
[00:17:36] Gerard Donnelly: She's exhausted.
[00:17:38] Gerard Donnelly: That's a great program.
[00:17:39] Gerard Donnelly: Well done.
[00:17:39] Gerard Donnelly: If just change that one thing.
[00:17:41] Gerard Donnelly: Yep.
[00:17:42] Gerard Donnelly: And just make sure that when she does the Zone 2 stuff on a Wednesday, you've got to be strict on this.
[00:17:51] Gerard Donnelly: Well, she's safe.
[00:17:52] Abby Jorgensen: She's safe.
[00:17:53] Abby Jorgensen: Yeah.
[00:17:55] Gerard Donnelly: So, you know, she spent half an hour in Zone 3.
[00:17:57] Gerard Donnelly: a operation.
[00:17:59] Gerard Donnelly: If I can do this,
[00:18:00] Gerard Donnelly: Bella, this is not the day to do that.
[00:18:02] Gerard Donnelly: You've got to cut that out.
[00:18:04] Gerard Donnelly: You want to see everything in Zone 1 and 2, all right?
[00:18:07] Abby Jorgensen: Okay.
[00:18:09] Gerard Donnelly: Otherwise, you're just flattening yourself.
[00:18:13] Gerard Donnelly: Did she nail this?
[00:18:19] Abby Jorgensen: Yeah.
[00:18:23] Gerard Donnelly: Yep, she sure did.
[00:18:29] Gerard Donnelly: Yep, so that would be the only thing I would say.
[00:18:34] Gerard Donnelly: And then this ride, she's allowed to do as much in every zone as she wants.
[00:18:42] Gerard Donnelly: Which, you know, tell her, we're happy for this ride.
[00:18:45] Gerard Donnelly: They've got to be different.
[00:18:46] Gerard Donnelly: These two rides are going to be different.
[00:18:47] Gerard Donnelly: Wednesday and Sunday has to be different.
[00:18:49] Gerard Donnelly: Okay.
[00:18:50] Gerard Donnelly: This can be a mixture, but Wednesday can't.
[00:18:54] Gerard Donnelly: It's not negotiable.
[00:18:55] Gerard Donnelly: It's, you you don't get the world tour riders riding.
[00:19:00] Gerard Donnelly: You know, outside of Zone 2 on their Zone 2 date.
[00:19:04] Gerard Donnelly: Great.
[00:19:05] Gerard Donnelly: Well done.
[00:19:09] Gerard Donnelly: Dougie?
[00:19:10] Gerard Donnelly: It's a little all over the place.
[00:19:12] Abby Jorgensen: He did that high rocks and then got a couple injuries.
[00:19:16] Abby Jorgensen: Yes.
[00:19:17] Abby Jorgensen: So then he's in Dubai this week.
[00:19:20] Abby Jorgensen: Yeah, okay.
[00:19:21] Gerard Donnelly: So we're just trying to do some gym stuff.
[00:19:24] Gerard Donnelly: Okay.
[00:19:24] Gerard Donnelly: Do some gym stuff until he gets back.
[00:19:27] Abby Jorgensen: Yep.
[00:19:28] Gerard Donnelly: Yep.
[00:19:28] Abby Jorgensen: I mean, he still wants to, he's, once his high, he's, I mean, he still wants to do high rocks in triathlon and he knows that they can complement each other.
[00:19:38] Abby Jorgensen: But yeah, I think once he gets back from Dubai, he said he's ready to hopefully test.
[00:19:46] Abby Jorgensen: Yep.
[00:19:46] Abby Jorgensen: Does he keep, do you want to do more high rocks events?
[00:19:49] Gerard Donnelly: Yeah.
[00:19:50] Abby Jorgensen: So Abby, I don't mind.
[00:19:52] Gerard Donnelly: I coached two guys last year for high rocks.
[00:19:55] Gerard Donnelly: So I don't mind if, if you give him some high rock sessions.
[00:19:59] Gerard Donnelly: Okay.
[00:20:00] Abby Jorgensen: I told him, like, I asked him what his, the gym he goes to, like, what kind of programming they do, like, from, like, a compromised run and, like, the run workouts, and he says it's not, I mean, he was going to send me some workouts, so I was like, you know, that 1K, 1K repeats and stuff would probably be good for him.
[00:20:20] Gerard Donnelly: Yeah, well, I can, let me, let me just grab.
[00:20:30] Abby Jorgensen: I know Jordan said that you guys had thought about adding that as, like, a option for people.
[00:20:37] Abby Jorgensen: I know it's getting pretty popular over here.
[00:20:40] Abby Jorgensen: Yeah.
[00:20:41] Abby Jorgensen: It's like the new CrossFit, I think.
[00:20:43] Abby Jorgensen: Yes, it is.
[00:20:44] Gerard Donnelly: It's just an extension of that.
[00:20:46] Gerard Donnelly: Yeah.
[00:20:48] Gerard Donnelly: So Darren is a guy I coached, and I stopped coaching him after his last event.
[00:20:59] Gerard Donnelly: Good.
[00:20:59] Gerard Donnelly: Good.
[00:21:00] Gerard Donnelly: It's a while since I've coached him.
[00:21:02] Gerard Donnelly: I've got all these high rock sessions in here if you want.
[00:21:06] Gerard Donnelly: Okay.
[00:21:07] Abby Jorgensen: I've made a program for them.
[00:21:16] Abby Jorgensen: I mean, I tell people it's a running workout with stuff.
[00:21:21] Abby Jorgensen: I mean, I've contemplated doing one as well at some point.
[00:21:26] Abby Jorgensen: What was his race in St Kilda?
[00:21:38] Gerard Donnelly: He swaps and changes.
[00:21:40] Gerard Donnelly: That's the trouble.
[00:21:41] Gerard Donnelly: He was training for a mountain bike race.
[00:21:43] Gerard Donnelly: Then he was training for a triathlon.
[00:21:45] Gerard Donnelly: Then he was training for high rocks.
[00:21:47] Gerard Donnelly: It was like the hardest thing to...
[00:21:49] Abby Jorgensen: I don't know.
[00:21:49] Abby Jorgensen: I have people like that, that they just want to jump from one thing to the next.
[00:21:56] Gerard Donnelly: Yeah, I want to really concentrate on my riding.
[00:21:58] Gerard Donnelly: Okay, off we go.
[00:21:59] Gerard Donnelly: right.
[00:21:59] Gerard Donnelly: here.
[00:21:59] Gerard Donnelly: All Great.
[00:21:59] Gerard Donnelly: All All you.
[00:22:00] Gerard Donnelly: No, I think I'm enjoying my running.
[00:22:03] Gerard Donnelly: Are we stopping the writing?
[00:22:04] Gerard Donnelly: Yeah.
[00:22:05] Gerard Donnelly: And look, there's High Rocks events.
[00:22:09] Abby Jorgensen: I mean, they can compliment, but you got to do it right.
[00:22:12] Abby Jorgensen: Yeah.
[00:22:14] Gerard Donnelly: Oh, here we go.
[00:22:15] Abby Jorgensen: There was an article about how triathletes will start High Rocks, the level.
[00:22:22] Gerard Donnelly: Right.
[00:22:23] Gerard Donnelly: So where's some sessions?
[00:22:30] Gerard Donnelly: So this is what I gave him.
[00:22:32] Gerard Donnelly: I gave him, I want him to do burpee, jump, wall balls, farmers carry and sandbag.
[00:22:40] Gerard Donnelly: So it was like 30 metres, two minutes on the treadmill, then 30 wall balls, then two minutes on the treadmill, then 30 burpees, 30 metres, then two minutes.
[00:22:51] Gerard Donnelly: That kind of session, then rest and then do the farmers carry, two minutes on the treadmill, 40 metres sandbag, two minutes on the treadmill.
[00:22:59] Gerard Donnelly: So it was.
[00:22:59] Gerard Donnelly: So
[00:23:00] Gerard Donnelly: Very specific, Abby.
[00:23:01] Abby Jorgensen: Yeah.
[00:23:02] Gerard Donnelly: And I'm happy to, you know, to copy those sessions if you want.
[00:23:07] Gerard Donnelly: Yeah.
[00:23:08] Gerard Donnelly: I mean, I actually haven't saved them as anything, so I should actually create.
[00:23:14] Abby Jorgensen: I've had some people here at my old gym, too, that have trained for some, and I've wrote some programs.
[00:23:21] Gerard Donnelly: Why don't just call it Hirox, eh?
[00:23:24] Gerard Donnelly: Yeah.
[00:23:29] Abby Jorgensen: I mean, I like that it's specific, so you can actually train for it.
[00:23:32] Abby Jorgensen: With CrossFit, it's unpredictable, so you don't really, you just, it's so randomized.
[00:23:38] Abby Jorgensen: Yeah.
[00:23:40] Gerard Donnelly: Right, now I've to find it.
[00:23:49] Gerard Donnelly: Hirox, there it is.
[00:23:52] Gerard Donnelly: Okay, so just remind me, because I've got so many variations of it, they're all just called ...
[00:24:00] Gerard Donnelly: Cross-Train High Rocks, and each week, he should have been doing that, there's Ski Erg and stuff.
[00:24:09] Gerard Donnelly: Yep, so I think he was just on the Ski Erg for that one.
[00:24:16] Gerard Donnelly: But generally each week I was giving him just variations of that twice a week, plus he still wanted to run.
[00:24:25] Gerard Donnelly: So that was a running program, that was into the High Rocks Melbourne race.
[00:24:30] Gerard Donnelly: What was his time, do know?
[00:24:34] Abby Jorgensen: 1.27?
[00:24:36] Abby Jorgensen: That looks about right, doesn't it?
[00:24:39] Gerard Donnelly: I think he got third in his age group.
[00:24:44] Gerard Donnelly: That's about all information you get.
[00:24:49] Gerard Donnelly: That was it.
[00:24:52] Gerard Donnelly: All right.
[00:24:55] Abby Jorgensen: I don't know, I got them lined up.
[00:24:58] Abby Jorgensen: What was that, Abby?
[00:25:05] Abby Jorgensen: All right.
[00:25:07] Abby Jorgensen: I didn't hear what you said then.
[00:25:09] Gerard Donnelly: Oh, my dogs.
[00:25:09] Gerard Donnelly: don't know what.
[00:25:14] Abby Jorgensen: Andrew?
[00:25:15] Abby Jorgensen: Andrew, he's doing good.
[00:25:16] Abby Jorgensen: We tested him last week.
[00:25:27] Gerard Donnelly: How'd he go?
[00:25:28] Gerard Donnelly: Good.
[00:25:29] Abby Jorgensen: I mean, coming from, you know, an Ironman to Fiat Thoth, not terrible, 216, I think that was, he did that back in July timeframe, I believe, if I remember off the top of my head.
[00:25:44] Abby Jorgensen: Yeah.
[00:25:45] Gerard Donnelly: I mean, it's different for, where is it in the year?
[00:25:50] Abby Jorgensen: Mm-hmm.
[00:25:54] Gerard Donnelly: It's sixth best, so it's not that bad.
[00:25:58] Gerard Donnelly: Yeah, he totally.
[00:26:00] Abby Jorgensen: I didn't expect.
[00:26:02] Gerard Donnelly: It's good that they understand.
[00:26:07] Gerard Donnelly: Yeah, I told him too.
[00:26:08] Abby Jorgensen: I was like, don't expect.
[00:26:09] Abby Jorgensen: He was like, oh, I don't totally expect anything close to.
[00:26:13] Abby Jorgensen: Yeah.
[00:26:14] Abby Jorgensen: And did he run okay with his 5K?
[00:26:17] Abby Jorgensen: Yeah, he had to do it on an indoor YMCA track.
[00:26:22] Abby Jorgensen: Oh, wow.
[00:26:23] Abby Jorgensen: The watch didn't, the laps tracked like a 5K, but his watch didn't, said it wasn't a 5K.
[00:26:32] Abby Jorgensen: So, you know, take it for what it's worth.
[00:26:35] Abby Jorgensen: It isn't, he doesn't only have the Apple watch though.
[00:26:37] Abby Jorgensen: So the GPS on that isn't, isn't great.
[00:26:41] Abby Jorgensen: So, so yeah, I don't know how accurate it is, but from a pace wise, he felt pretty good.
[00:26:47] Abby Jorgensen: That was the fastest.
[00:26:48] Abby Jorgensen: He's kind of run a 5K.
[00:26:51] Gerard Donnelly: What did he run?
[00:26:53] Gerard Donnelly: Under 5-minute K pace.
[00:26:55] Abby Jorgensen: Yeah, mean, he was in the 7s, like 7.57.
[00:26:58] Abby Jorgensen: Yep.
[00:26:59] Abby Jorgensen: Sorry.
[00:27:04] Gerard Donnelly: Yeah, and good negative split.
[00:27:07] Abby Jorgensen: That's great.
[00:27:08] Gerard Donnelly: So he's set for the next program then?
[00:27:13] Abby Jorgensen: Yep.
[00:27:14] Abby Jorgensen: Once July hits, or not July, January hits, I'm going to add the next, add back in a full week.
[00:27:22] Abby Jorgensen: He just wants to go through the holidays and then get back into.
[00:27:26] Abby Jorgensen: Yep.
[00:27:27] Abby Jorgensen: Okay.
[00:27:29] Gerard Donnelly: Scene?
[00:27:32] Abby Jorgensen: He's good.
[00:27:33] Abby Jorgensen: Yeah, we tested him as well.
[00:27:35] Abby Jorgensen: 10 watt increase and then like a two minute 10 KPR.
[00:27:38] Abby Jorgensen: Oh, wow.
[00:27:41] Abby Jorgensen: And then his swim was slower, but he went from a 25 meter pool to a 50 meter pool.
[00:27:47] Abby Jorgensen: Well, that explains that.
[00:27:49] Abby Jorgensen: Yeah, that's what I told him too.
[00:27:50] Abby Jorgensen: I was like, that explains it, so I'm not too worried about that.
[00:27:53] Abby Jorgensen: Was he happy?
[00:27:54] Abby Jorgensen: Yeah, he was happy.
[00:27:57] Gerard Donnelly: He's pretty like an even keel guy.
[00:27:58] Abby Jorgensen: Doesn't show a lot of...
[00:28:00] Abby Jorgensen: Emotion, yeah.
[00:28:01] Abby Jorgensen: Emotion.
[00:28:02] Abby Jorgensen: Yep.
[00:28:04] Gerard Donnelly: That's good.
[00:28:08] Abby Jorgensen: That's great, Abby.
[00:28:09] Abby Jorgensen: That's a good program.
[00:28:10] Gerard Donnelly: And he's away in the mountains.
[00:28:12] Gerard Donnelly: Yeah.
[00:28:13] Abby Jorgensen: So he's in cross-country skiing, so.
[00:28:15] Abby Jorgensen: Yep.
[00:28:17] Gerard Donnelly: That counts as something, I'm assuming.
[00:28:19] Abby Jorgensen: It does, absolutely.
[00:28:21] Gerard Donnelly: I would encourage him to get out there for the day.
[00:28:25] Gerard Donnelly: How's John DaCosta going?
[00:28:28] Abby Jorgensen: He raced, I don't know why I didn't upload.
[00:28:32] Abby Jorgensen: Did he go okay?
[00:28:33] Gerard Donnelly: Yeah, he sent it to me.
[00:28:35] Abby Jorgensen: Let me pull it.
[00:28:36] Gerard Donnelly: Can you make sure Marvin gets that data?
[00:28:42] Gerard Donnelly: Yeah.
[00:28:43] Abby Jorgensen: And puts it into an event?
[00:28:46] Gerard Donnelly: If you can find the results, send that to him.
[00:28:50] Gerard Donnelly: Yeah, I found it the other day, but he, let's see here.
[00:28:54] Abby Jorgensen: He got fourth.
[00:28:55] Abby Jorgensen: I know he beat his brother, and that was was the biggest he wanted to do.
[00:28:59] Abby Jorgensen: do, and that he do, and that that
[00:29:00] Abby Jorgensen: The swim is what it was.
[00:29:02] Abby Jorgensen: He said he had a panic attack, which he hasn't done any open water swimming.
[00:29:07] Abby Jorgensen: then your first open water swim is the ocean.
[00:29:10] Abby Jorgensen: 26 minutes for 900 meters.
[00:29:13] Abby Jorgensen: Yes, okay.
[00:29:15] Abby Jorgensen: But let's see, his bike was 107.37 for 22 miles.
[00:29:22] Abby Jorgensen: Yeah, and what was his power in there?
[00:29:24] Gerard Donnelly: Because he did 246 on the Tuesday.
[00:29:28] Gerard Donnelly: Yeah.
[00:29:28] Abby Jorgensen: I told him what I'd tell him.
[00:29:31] Abby Jorgensen: I was pretty conservative with him.
[00:29:33] Abby Jorgensen: 185 to 210, I told him.
[00:29:37] Abby Jorgensen: Yep.
[00:29:38] Abby Jorgensen: And then his 5K or his 10K was 48.37.
[00:29:44] Abby Jorgensen: So an 806 mile pace.
[00:29:47] Abby Jorgensen: That's great.
[00:29:48] Abby Jorgensen: Did he execute well?
[00:29:50] Abby Jorgensen: I don't know because I don't have the, he hasn't uploaded anything.
[00:29:53] Abby Jorgensen: But according to like the plan I gave him, like from a run standpoint, that was.
[00:29:59] Abby Jorgensen: Yeah.
[00:30:00] Abby Jorgensen: Almost even better than what I had expected just because of minimal data we've had.
[00:30:04] Abby Jorgensen: Well done, Abby.
[00:30:06] Abby Jorgensen: But he said that the plan helped him get him through the race.
[00:30:11] Abby Jorgensen: Yeah.
[00:30:12] Abby Jorgensen: Terrific.
[00:30:13] Gerard Donnelly: That's great coaching.
[00:30:15] Abby Jorgensen: So we'll see what, you know, once he gets, because he said that he got that Wahoo and then his bike is so old that they can't match a cassette to it.
[00:30:23] Abby Jorgensen: So he's just been using, like, a dumb trainer, which is fine, but I feel bad that he bought a Wahoo and then they can't get it to, I don't know.
[00:30:33] Abby Jorgensen: He says it's probably time to look at a new bike, and I was like, possibly.
[00:30:38] Abby Jorgensen: Yeah.
[00:30:38] Gerard Donnelly: So his bike might not be a 9 or 10 or 11 speed.
[00:30:41] Gerard Donnelly: It might be a 7 speed.
[00:30:43] Gerard Donnelly: Okay.
[00:30:44] Gerard Donnelly: And, you know, because that means the frame's not wide enough to fit the cassette in.
[00:30:48] Gerard Donnelly: Um, yeah.
[00:30:54] Abby Jorgensen: Yeah.
[00:30:55] Abby Jorgensen: You can.
[00:30:58] Gerard Donnelly: Yeah.
[00:31:00] Gerard Donnelly: You should Google it.
[00:31:01] Gerard Donnelly: There must be a solution to that.
[00:31:02] Gerard Donnelly: There must be people with old bikes buying Wahoos.
[00:31:06] Abby Jorgensen: You would think.
[00:31:07] Abby Jorgensen: Yeah.
[00:31:08] Abby Jorgensen: Ask him to research a bit.
[00:31:10] Gerard Donnelly: Okay.
[00:31:11] Gerard Donnelly: Don't take the bike shops.
[00:31:12] Gerard Donnelly: Sometimes the bike shops go, it's too hard.
[00:31:16] Gerard Donnelly: Yeah.
[00:31:16] Abby Jorgensen: I think once he got this race done, though, I think he, because he was like, I definitely want to do more.
[00:31:20] Abby Jorgensen: So that's a good sign.
[00:31:22] Abby Jorgensen: Yeah.
[00:31:23] Gerard Donnelly: I'll encourage him because we, it's hard to do it as a dumb trainer, but anyway.
[00:31:27] Gerard Donnelly: Yeah.
[00:31:28] Abby Jorgensen: I've been there, but.
[00:31:30] Abby Jorgensen: Yes.
[00:31:30] Abby Jorgensen: How's Chris going?
[00:31:32] Gerard Donnelly: He's really good.
[00:31:33] Abby Jorgensen: He's fun to work with.
[00:31:35] Abby Jorgensen: Is he?
[00:31:36] Abby Jorgensen: Really, yeah.
[00:31:36] Abby Jorgensen: He really likes the data.
[00:31:38] Abby Jorgensen: Yeah.
[00:31:39] Abby Jorgensen: From that standpoint.
[00:31:41] Abby Jorgensen: So I've made a couple of videos of him kind of, because he wanted to just to know, like, what I look at.
[00:31:46] Abby Jorgensen: Yes.
[00:31:47] Abby Jorgensen: So.
[00:31:48] Abby Jorgensen: Yeah.
[00:31:49] Abby Jorgensen: Can you, I'm looking at his spreadsheet.
[00:31:51] Gerard Donnelly: There's no data in there.
[00:31:52] Gerard Donnelly: Can you send Marv a reminder that he's FTP?
[00:31:57] Gerard Donnelly: From December the 3rd and he swim from.
[00:32:00] Gerard Donnelly: December the 4th and his 5K run, none of that's in there?
[00:32:17] Gerard Donnelly: He has his Sundays off, doesn't he?
[00:32:19] Abby Jorgensen: Yeah.
[00:32:20] Abby Jorgensen: Yep.
[00:32:21] Abby Jorgensen: And he's going to Colorado for a break.
[00:32:24] Abby Jorgensen: Yep.
[00:32:25] Abby Jorgensen: I told him to take his pedals because he has, wherever he's going, I know it's family, but they have a Peloton.
[00:32:34] Abby Jorgensen: So I was like, take your own pedals and we can do that.
[00:32:40] Abby Jorgensen: But so he's going to 9,000 feet.
[00:32:43] Abby Jorgensen: Should I, he says, obviously that affects his cardio.
[00:32:49] Abby Jorgensen: Should I just lower the percentage of some of the workouts next week?
[00:32:52] Abby Jorgensen: Yeah.
[00:32:55] Gerard Donnelly: Just let me, just let me remind myself what, oh.
[00:33:00] Gerard Donnelly: 2,700 meters.
[00:33:01] Gerard Donnelly: Oh, my goodness.
[00:33:02] Gerard Donnelly: Wow.
[00:33:02] Abby Jorgensen: Yeah, mean, Frisco is, when I lived in Colorado, Colorado Springs was 6,000 feet.
[00:33:09] Abby Jorgensen: So Frisco is, yeah, that's way up there in the mountains.
[00:33:13] Gerard Donnelly: Yeah, give him the same sessions, but tell him that he can be at the bottom or below the range.
[00:33:22] Gerard Donnelly: You know, just give him, so you could, instead of, you know, if you grab the, I don't know, what is he doing?
[00:33:29] Gerard Donnelly: He's doing five by five.
[00:33:31] Gerard Donnelly: Leave the session as it is, and then just go in and adjust, adjust here to make it, you know, 85 to 90.
[00:33:38] Gerard Donnelly: You go and adjust them, okay?
[00:33:40] Abby Jorgensen: Yep.
[00:33:41] Gerard Donnelly: But the session's already there.
[00:33:43] Gerard Donnelly: All you have to do is adjust that one thing, and then, so any session you grab, just, you just reduce it and allow for the altitude.
[00:33:52] Gerard Donnelly: Okay.
[00:33:54] Abby Jorgensen: Okay?
[00:33:54] Abby Jorgensen: And it being a Peloton, actually, it might be, I don't know.
[00:33:59] Abby Jorgensen: Hard to tell.
[00:33:59] Abby Jorgensen: tell.
[00:34:00] Abby Jorgensen: Positioning-wise, I know they seem a little easier.
[00:34:03] Gerard Donnelly: I would just give him the VO2 stuff, RPE.
[00:34:08] Gerard Donnelly: I would just grab these.
[00:34:10] Gerard Donnelly: You've got these, haven't you?
[00:34:11] Gerard Donnelly: Hotel 1, Hotel 2.
[00:34:14] Gerard Donnelly: I know the word hotels there, but I would be just grabbing that stuff.
[00:34:18] Gerard Donnelly: And that's really RPE, I know.
[00:34:21] Gerard Donnelly: But if you think that's easier for him, then, or just give him the 30-30s for the power and 30-15s.
[00:34:36] Gerard Donnelly: give him a mixture of the short stuff.
[00:34:38] Gerard Donnelly: So just give him two, you know, one of those sets, a 30-30 set, you know, and maybe something with the strength efforts.
[00:34:47] Gerard Donnelly: That would be good.
[00:34:49] Abby Jorgensen: But he's only there for...
[00:34:51] Gerard Donnelly: Four days.
[00:34:54] Gerard Donnelly: He's there for six days, but he's there for four sessions.
[00:34:58] Gerard Donnelly: Okay.
[00:35:00] Gerard Donnelly: So, yeah, maybe give him one 30-30 and one strength effort for his bike and then a couple of treadmill runs.
[00:35:07] Gerard Donnelly: Okay.
[00:35:10] Abby Jorgensen: He may be able to run.
[00:35:12] Abby Jorgensen: I think, I can't remember how much snow they've gotten, probably more than one year, but.
[00:35:18] Gerard Donnelly: How's Kevin going?
[00:35:20] Abby Jorgensen: He's good, besides he got sick right before his FTP, so we're trying to push that back.
[00:35:25] Abby Jorgensen: Yeah, good.
[00:35:27] Gerard Donnelly: Don't let him do any testing when they're sick.
[00:35:30] Abby Jorgensen: Yeah, he did the, he started feeling good yesterday and then this morning he messaged me.
[00:35:35] Abby Jorgensen: He's like, let's push it back even more.
[00:35:37] Abby Jorgensen: So I put it like at the end of the week or something.
[00:35:41] Gerard Donnelly: Yeah, and look, if you think he's not right, don't do it on Thursday either.
[00:35:45] Gerard Donnelly: Just have a week of getting back to training, Abby.
[00:35:49] Abby Jorgensen: There's no rush at this time.
[00:35:50] Gerard Donnelly: We don't need to rush.
[00:35:51] Gerard Donnelly: We can do the testing the following week after, you know, at the back end of Christmas or.
[00:35:58] Gerard Donnelly: No.
[00:36:00] Gerard Donnelly: So be quite lenient, you know, we don't really want to test them straight away, just give them some easy sessions, some zone two, you know, any of these, any of these zone two and three sessions, there's a whole list of those you could do, where, you know, it's kind of in between zone two and zone four.
[00:36:26] Gerard Donnelly: Sorry, my dog's making some funny, strange sound.
[00:36:30] Abby Jorgensen: I mean, mine do that all the time.
[00:36:32] Abby Jorgensen: Warning.
[00:36:35] Gerard Donnelly: Richard?
[00:36:37] Gerard Donnelly: He's good.
[00:36:38] Abby Jorgensen: I'm trying to think.
[00:36:40] Abby Jorgensen: Nothing outside of the...
[00:36:42] Abby Jorgensen: He did say with the 60s, where was that?
[00:36:56] Abby Jorgensen: So when it comes up on the computer...
[00:37:00] Abby Jorgensen: He says it's something with the, the cadence says undefined.
[00:37:06] Abby Jorgensen: He's really, like, he really wants, like, the cadence up on his screen.
[00:37:11] Abby Jorgensen: Yes.
[00:37:11] Abby Jorgensen: The other workouts do it.
[00:37:13] Abby Jorgensen: So I went in to try to see, and I'm like, well, the cadence is there, but it says undefined.
[00:37:18] Abby Jorgensen: So I don't know what that means.
[00:37:20] Abby Jorgensen: Yeah, I don't write that word.
[00:37:22] Gerard Donnelly: I don't know.
[00:37:24] Gerard Donnelly: I'm like, it's there.
[00:37:26] Abby Jorgensen: I've selected 90 to 100.
[00:37:30] Gerard Donnelly: Do you know what mean?
[00:37:31] Gerard Donnelly: Yeah, that's why I was like, I don't understand what's happening.
[00:37:34] Abby Jorgensen: Just tell him not to worry.
[00:37:35] Gerard Donnelly: It's not up on the screen.
[00:37:37] Abby Jorgensen: Yeah, I told him, I'm like, it's just going to be somewhere between that, that high 90s.
[00:37:43] Abby Jorgensen: Just aim, don't worry about anything else.
[00:37:45] Abby Jorgensen: Like, make it above 90.
[00:37:47] Abby Jorgensen: Yeah, I was like, I know you're particular, but like, it's fine.
[00:37:51] Abby Jorgensen: Just.
[00:37:51] Abby Jorgensen: Well, we can't do any more.
[00:37:53] Abby Jorgensen: I don't know why.
[00:37:54] Abby Jorgensen: Yeah, I even tried to, like, delete it and add it back in, and it still didn't do anything.
[00:37:59] Abby Jorgensen: So I don't know.
[00:38:02] Gerard Donnelly: Yeah, me too.
[00:38:03] Gerard Donnelly: I'm not sure.
[00:38:06] Gerard Donnelly: No one's asked about that.
[00:38:10] Abby Jorgensen: I told him I'd ask because I was like, I can't fix it.
[00:38:12] Abby Jorgensen: Yep.
[00:38:14] Gerard Donnelly: That might be a question to TrainingPeaks for him.
[00:38:21] Abby Jorgensen: But yeah, I don't know.
[00:38:22] Abby Jorgensen: He doesn't use any Swift or anything like that, so he just relies on his computer screen.
[00:38:28] Gerard Donnelly: Yeah, well, don't forget this.
[00:38:31] Gerard Donnelly: This is the theory.
[00:38:32] Gerard Donnelly: If we say strength effort in the heading, that's the only time we would really be happy for anybody to be under 90 RPM.
[00:38:40] Gerard Donnelly: Okay.
[00:38:41] Gerard Donnelly: If it doesn't say strength effort, just assume that it's going to be 90 and above.
[00:38:47] Gerard Donnelly: That's our goal.
[00:38:48] Gerard Donnelly: All the time, Abby, is to get everybody riding 90 above except strength effort.
[00:38:54] Gerard Donnelly: So that's really easy to get that message across.
[00:38:56] Gerard Donnelly: Look, if it says strength effort and you know it's going to be somewhere between 60 and
[00:39:00] Gerard Donnelly: 60 80, or 60 and 75.
[00:39:04] Gerard Donnelly: Otherwise, he's going all right?
[00:39:06] Abby Jorgensen: Yep.
[00:39:08] Abby Jorgensen: That's good.
[00:39:12] Abby Jorgensen: He'd be due to test soon, but how's Michaela going?
[00:39:18] Gerard Donnelly: Oh, she's good.
[00:39:19] Abby Jorgensen: She has some ligament in her ankle.
[00:39:25] Abby Jorgensen: She's not allowed to run right now per physio.
[00:39:28] Abby Jorgensen: Yep.
[00:39:30] Abby Jorgensen: Partially torn ATFL and ankle.
[00:39:34] Gerard Donnelly: How'd she do that?
[00:39:37] Abby Jorgensen: She rolled it running.
[00:39:40] Abby Jorgensen: This is really weak.
[00:39:41] Abby Jorgensen: She said she's had that one fixed when she was a kid as well.
[00:39:47] Gerard Donnelly: Can you give her some stability exercises?
[00:39:52] Gerard Donnelly: Yeah, both me and the physio have.
[00:39:56] Abby Jorgensen: She knows.
[00:39:57] Abby Jorgensen: She's weak.
[00:39:59] Abby Jorgensen: Yeah.
[00:40:00] Gerard Donnelly: Just standing on one foot and balancing is, that's the basic exercise you could do, is balance for 30 seconds on each foot times five.
[00:40:12] Gerard Donnelly: I mean, people go, is that it?
[00:40:14] Gerard Donnelly: Yeah.
[00:40:15] Gerard Donnelly: You try doing it.
[00:40:16] Gerard Donnelly: It's not easy.
[00:40:17] Abby Jorgensen: She jokes that, she's like, have you talked to my physio?
[00:40:20] Abby Jorgensen: I was like, no.
[00:40:21] Abby Jorgensen: She's like, well, she says I'm weak too.
[00:40:23] Abby Jorgensen: I was like, well.
[00:40:24] Abby Jorgensen: Yeah.
[00:40:26] Abby Jorgensen: All right.
[00:40:26] Abby Jorgensen: You got her under control.
[00:40:28] Gerard Donnelly: So my message to any athlete who's incapacitated with running, great opportunity to pick up the bike and swim.
[00:40:37] Gerard Donnelly: Yeah, that's what I told her.
[00:40:38] Gerard Donnelly: She can't kick though.
[00:40:40] Abby Jorgensen: So I told her pull buoy and just, you know, do what she can.
[00:40:46] Abby Jorgensen: Blair going all right?
[00:40:47] Abby Jorgensen: Yeah, we took out, he tweaked his knee doing something.
[00:40:52] Abby Jorgensen: don't know if it was hockey or whatnot.
[00:40:54] Abby Jorgensen: So he took out running until, because he has a ski trip next week for a while.
[00:41:00] Abby Jorgensen: He didn't want to be hurt for that.
[00:41:02] Abby Jorgensen: Yep, great.
[00:41:02] Gerard Donnelly: So he's got a really big bike program.
[00:41:05] Gerard Donnelly: That's great.
[00:41:06] Abby Jorgensen: Fantastic.
[00:41:08] Gerard Donnelly: Now, you're really doing good programs, Abby.
[00:41:12] Gerard Donnelly: Thank you.
[00:41:13] Abby Jorgensen: That's the fun part.
[00:41:15] Abby Jorgensen: What did you say?
[00:41:16] Abby Jorgensen: I like programming.
[00:41:17] Abby Jorgensen: It's fun for me.
[00:41:19] Abby Jorgensen: Yes.
[00:41:20] Gerard Donnelly: You've really got the idea of how important it is to spread things out and what we're trying to do with the VO2 and the strength and the threshold.
[00:41:28] Gerard Donnelly: So, Pemberton, enjoying coaching?
[00:41:34] Abby Jorgensen: Yeah, no, she's really not that bad.
[00:41:37] Abby Jorgensen: She did get sick this weekend, too, so we pushed her.
[00:41:40] Abby Jorgensen: I'm pushing her 5K back.
[00:41:42] Abby Jorgensen: Yes.
[00:41:42] Abby Jorgensen: A little bit.
[00:41:43] Abby Jorgensen: But she went down two watts.
[00:41:46] Abby Jorgensen: But if you look at her last time, she was on a beta blocker.
[00:41:52] Abby Jorgensen: So her heart rate, I think their max heart rate at her last test was like 150.
[00:41:57] Abby Jorgensen: And this time it was 170.
[00:41:59] Abby Jorgensen: 70.
[00:42:00] Abby Jorgensen: 72.
[00:42:01] Abby Jorgensen: So I was like, that has to be some sort of effect on your test this time versus last time.
[00:42:07] Abby Jorgensen: Absolutely.
[00:42:08] Abby Jorgensen: So I was.
[00:42:09] Abby Jorgensen: She executed beautifully.
[00:42:12] Abby Jorgensen: Yeah, that's what I told her too.
[00:42:13] Abby Jorgensen: was like, execution wise, you're fine.
[00:42:15] Abby Jorgensen: She said it was hard.
[00:42:17] Abby Jorgensen: I'm like, perfect.
[00:42:18] Abby Jorgensen: So I'm not worried that it went down two watts.
[00:42:21] Abby Jorgensen: So yeah.
[00:42:22] Abby Jorgensen: Yeah.
[00:42:23] Abby Jorgensen: Yeah.
[00:42:24] Gerard Donnelly: And she's off the beta blockers now?
[00:42:26] Gerard Donnelly: Yeah.
[00:42:27] Abby Jorgensen: She, when we first started, it was for her anxiety and stuff.
[00:42:31] Abby Jorgensen: So she's trying to, she was trying to wean off some of that.
[00:42:34] Abby Jorgensen: Yeah.
[00:42:34] Gerard Donnelly: I've just made a note in the spreadsheet that that test was with beta blockers.
[00:42:38] Gerard Donnelly: So we remember.
[00:42:40] Abby Jorgensen: Okay.
[00:42:40] Abby Jorgensen: Yeah.
[00:42:41] Abby Jorgensen: When I was looking at it, I was like, wait a second.
[00:42:44] Abby Jorgensen: Why, you know, weren't you on beta blockers here?
[00:42:47] Abby Jorgensen: So yeah, I was trying to figure out because of course she she wanted to know why she went down.
[00:42:54] Abby Jorgensen: I was like, you also, she also didn't have, she traveled quite a bit during that last block.
[00:42:59] Abby Jorgensen: So.
[00:42:59] Abby Jorgensen: Yeah.
[00:43:00] Abby Jorgensen: That doesn't help either.
[00:43:03] Gerard Donnelly: It's always interesting to see what they're doing in those five-minute efforts, because she's doing 200 watts there.
[00:43:09] Gerard Donnelly: And is she noting those five-minute efforts?
[00:43:15] Gerard Donnelly: So the other things you could say to her, Abby, look, her range is 187 to 195, and she's at 184.
[00:43:23] Gerard Donnelly: 190 is okay.
[00:43:28] Gerard Donnelly: Yeah, so she's kind of at the bottom of the range, isn't she, for a lot of those efforts, or below?
[00:43:34] Abby Jorgensen: Pretty fatigued last week as well.
[00:43:37] Abby Jorgensen: Yeah.
[00:43:39] Gerard Donnelly: And just emphasize that, yes, it's important that we see improvement, but it depends on how your block went.
[00:43:49] Abby Jorgensen: Mm-hmm.
[00:43:56] Abby Jorgensen: Pretty sure she nailed this one.
[00:43:59] Abby Jorgensen: Yeah.
[00:44:00] Abby Jorgensen: Or, I can't remember.
[00:44:03] Abby Jorgensen: I know if you're concerned about it.
[00:44:07] Gerard Donnelly: Yeah, she's going well there.
[00:44:09] Gerard Donnelly: Seems like everybody can do that, though.
[00:44:11] Gerard Donnelly: I don't know.
[00:44:12] Gerard Donnelly: The threshold bits are the ones that get them, isn't it?
[00:44:15] Gerard Donnelly: Yeah.
[00:44:16] Abby Jorgensen: I don't know.
[00:44:16] Abby Jorgensen: No, these get me.
[00:44:17] Abby Jorgensen: I don't.
[00:44:19] Abby Jorgensen: The last one that I did that I failed, I was, that was not, I was not feeling confident after that one.
[00:44:26] Gerard Donnelly: He's flying through this.
[00:44:29] Abby Jorgensen: Great cadence, great power.
[00:44:31] Gerard Donnelly: I'd say her weakness is threshold, Abby.
[00:44:33] Gerard Donnelly: I'd say that straight away.
[00:44:37] Gerard Donnelly: And that's where she's struggling in the FTP.
[00:44:41] Abby Jorgensen: So just more of like the, that threshold, those threshold ones?
[00:44:46] Gerard Donnelly: Well, I think if you look, if you look at what she did, she started at 182 last test, and this time she started at 200.
[00:44:54] Gerard Donnelly: And I think, just like you experienced, you know, she's ended up with a lower score.
[00:44:59] Gerard Donnelly: But to,
[00:45:00] Gerard Donnelly: Yet she started at 18 watts higher than she did last time.
[00:45:06] Gerard Donnelly: So she started where we would suggest she started, starts, she started exactly where you would have suggested.
[00:45:12] Gerard Donnelly: But I would say to her, okay, let's start next time, let's start lower, let's start at 192, 193, and finish off at, you know, 220, just get confidence back.
[00:45:24] Gerard Donnelly: Like, yeah, you proved it yourself, you know, by starting lower, it gives yourself more opportunity to.
[00:45:33] Abby Jorgensen: Yeah, if I'm, if by the 10 minute mark, I'm hating life, then I know I started to.
[00:45:39] Abby Jorgensen: Yeah.
[00:45:41] Abby Jorgensen: Last two tests, I think I've made it to like 12 or 14 before I was like, all right.
[00:45:46] Abby Jorgensen: Yeah, it's getting hard.
[00:45:47] Abby Jorgensen: Yeah.
[00:45:49] Abby Jorgensen: Yeah.
[00:45:50] Gerard Donnelly: All right.
[00:45:54] Gerard Donnelly: Glenn has his headspace.
[00:45:57] Gerard Donnelly: It's been a traumatic period with the race and the.
[00:45:59] Abby Jorgensen: Yeah.
[00:46:00] Abby Jorgensen: Yeah, I'm waiting to hear.
[00:46:01] Abby Jorgensen: I texted him, obviously, this morning, which was his night, so I'm waiting for him to respond back.
[00:46:08] Abby Jorgensen: But yeah, I know work was crazy, too, when he got back, so yeah, I'll see.
[00:46:16] Abby Jorgensen: I'm sure he'll respond at some point today, but yeah, that's tough.
[00:46:19] Abby Jorgensen: He was super excited about all that, so.
[00:46:22] Abby Jorgensen: Yeah, yeah.
[00:46:26] Gerard Donnelly: My niece just had a baby today.
[00:46:31] Gerard Donnelly: She had a surrogate baby, which was incredible.
[00:46:36] Abby Jorgensen: Oh.
[00:46:37] Abby Jorgensen: Who she had?
[00:46:39] Abby Jorgensen: Somebody she knows, or?
[00:46:40] Abby Jorgensen: Yeah.
[00:46:42] Gerard Donnelly: So that's her second surrogate baby.
[00:46:45] Gerard Donnelly: I mean, it's good money, I guess.
[00:46:47] Abby Jorgensen: Yeah, well, it's illegal in Australia.
[00:46:49] Gerard Donnelly: Oh, really?
[00:46:50] Abby Jorgensen: Okay.
[00:46:52] Abby Jorgensen: What's the story with that shooting at Beach?
[00:46:57] Abby Jorgensen: Just too.
[00:46:59] Gerard Donnelly: Just
[00:47:00] Gerard Donnelly: A father and son, just anti-Jewish, and there was a bit of a function down at the beach, and they just started firing at the group.
[00:47:14] Gerard Donnelly: Just ridiculous.
[00:47:16] Abby Jorgensen: Yeah, I heard there was a story on it, and then somebody was interviewed, and they're like, well, this isn't America, so we didn't expect anything like this.
[00:47:25] Abby Jorgensen: And I was like, that hit kind of hard.
[00:47:27] Abby Jorgensen: I'm like, because that's normal.
[00:47:30] Abby Jorgensen: We're here, apparently.
[00:47:31] Abby Jorgensen: That's a funny sentence to say, isn't it?
[00:47:33] Gerard Donnelly: Yeah.
[00:47:34] Abby Jorgensen: It kind of was like, yeah, because we just had the one at Brown University the same day.
[00:47:40] Abby Jorgensen: Same day?
[00:47:42] Gerard Donnelly: Same day, yeah.
[00:47:43] Abby Jorgensen: How many people died there?
[00:47:48] Abby Jorgensen: Five, is that right?
[00:47:50] Abby Jorgensen: I mean, yeah, I don't know.
[00:47:53] Abby Jorgensen: Yeah.
[00:47:57] Gerard Donnelly: Anyway, are we getting Mario sorted?
[00:47:59] Gerard Donnelly: Yeah.
[00:48:00] Abby Jorgensen: Yeah, he ordered his pedals yesterday, last night, yesterday.
[00:48:06] Abby Jorgensen: I just had a conversation with him on the phone today, actually.
[00:48:10] Abby Jorgensen: He just had some questions about, you know, like if he wakes up and his Garmin tells him he didn't, his battery's low, like how does he deal with that?
[00:48:19] Abby Jorgensen: So I just told him, don't even, don't even look at that until you assess how you feel.
[00:48:25] Abby Jorgensen: And then we'll go from there.
[00:48:27] Abby Jorgensen: it becomes a problem and you can feel it, then yes, pay attention to all those stats.
[00:48:32] Abby Jorgensen: But I was like, you got to take in the factor of stress, your kids, work, everything like that.
[00:48:38] Abby Jorgensen: But don't let that tell you, you can't train.
[00:48:42] Abby Jorgensen: So.
[00:48:43] Abby Jorgensen: Well done.
[00:48:44] Abby Jorgensen: Yeah.
[00:48:46] Gerard Donnelly: You know, I'm telling my athletes, don't look at your data until you've self-assessed.
[00:48:54] Gerard Donnelly: And don't, you know, don't be so detailed.
[00:48:58] Gerard Donnelly: Just get on with your day.
[00:48:59] Gerard Donnelly: It's like.
[00:49:00] Gerard Donnelly: You know, unless you say to yourself when you wake up, oh, far out, I'm exhausted, you know, you know, just wait till you get on, you know, get moving around the house and, you know, I don't want people to be so fixated on it that it's ruining their day.
[00:49:21] Abby Jorgensen: You know what I mean?
[00:49:22] Abby Jorgensen: Yeah, I don't even, I mean, my whoop tells me a little bit more than even Garmin, but yeah, I don't.
[00:49:30] Abby Jorgensen: If I, what that told me, I would probably wouldn't train a lot.
[00:49:34] Abby Jorgensen: Yep, and that's what you should say to him.
[00:49:35] Gerard Donnelly: And, and also use my example, like when I used my HRV for a long time, I used it for about 10 years and it would regularly, every time I was coming up for a race, Abby, it would say, take a rest day.
[00:49:51] Gerard Donnelly: Yeah.
[00:49:51] Gerard Donnelly: It was every race and, and I was going, what is wrong with this thing?
[00:49:55] Gerard Donnelly: Why is it, and eventually I worked out that my adrenaline.
[00:50:00] Gerard Donnelly: For the race was creating, the HRV was telling me that I was stressed, which was correct, but it was a good stress, you know, it wasn't a bad stress.
[00:50:10] Gerard Donnelly: And I competed fantastic on those days.
[00:50:13] Gerard Donnelly: And if I had listened to the HRV, I wouldn't have done any races.
[00:50:16] Abby Jorgensen: Yeah.
[00:50:18] Abby Jorgensen: Mine post Ironman was the lowest it was for like a month, but like I knew why.
[00:50:25] Abby Jorgensen: So.
[00:50:27] Gerard Donnelly: Yeah.
[00:50:30] Gerard Donnelly: Um, good.
[00:50:31] Gerard Donnelly: So you feel like you've got him, uh, heading in the right direction.
[00:50:34] Abby Jorgensen: Yeah, I just got him on the bike to, I was like, until like when is, I didn't want to test him.
[00:50:40] Abby Jorgensen: Cause I was like, if you have them ordered, we might as well wait.
[00:50:45] Abby Jorgensen: Yeah.
[00:50:45] Abby Jorgensen: Yeah.
[00:50:46] Gerard Donnelly: And he's, he's  hurting.
[00:50:49] Abby Jorgensen: He's just not you.
[00:50:50] Abby Jorgensen: He said he's definitely feeling like more hungry, a little fatigued.
[00:50:54] Abby Jorgensen: I was like, just not used to doing something every day.
[00:50:58] Abby Jorgensen: Consistent training.
[00:50:58] Abby Jorgensen: Yeah.
[00:50:59] Abby Jorgensen: So.
[00:51:00] Abby Jorgensen: So that's my first thing with him, just get consistent.
[00:51:03] Abby Jorgensen: Yep.
[00:51:04] Abby Jorgensen: Yep.
[00:51:05] Abby Jorgensen: Great.
[00:51:05] Abby Jorgensen: All right.
[00:51:06] Abby Jorgensen: Mark?
[00:51:08] Abby Jorgensen: Mark, he's trying to settle into a routine now that, you know, with his, he lost the surgeon.
[00:51:15] Abby Jorgensen: So, but he, I told him, I was like, Hey, like, what do we need to do?
[00:51:18] Abby Jorgensen: And he's like, keep it the way it is.
[00:51:20] Abby Jorgensen: I'm trying to figure out if I can train, I can train.
[00:51:23] Abby Jorgensen: And I was like, well, if we need to cut something out, I'll cut out a swim, you know, things like that.
[00:51:28] Abby Jorgensen: So, um, he also has a little patellar pain.
[00:51:33] Abby Jorgensen: So, um, I'm trying to get, is that a bike fit thing?
[00:51:37] Abby Jorgensen: I mean, um, I think it's a running thing.
[00:51:41] Abby Jorgensen: He says he feels better when he's on the treadmill and not the concrete, which I'm like, well, yeah.
[00:51:47] Abby Jorgensen: Um, yep.
[00:51:49] Abby Jorgensen: But he also hasn't, he knows he needs to start adding back in some strength training.
[00:51:52] Abby Jorgensen: It's just a matter of.
[00:51:54] Abby Jorgensen: Yep.
[00:51:55] Gerard Donnelly: Well, uh, where's he live?
[00:51:57] Gerard Donnelly: Nashville is.
[00:52:00] Gerard Donnelly: Is it warmer there all the time?
[00:52:02] Abby Jorgensen: It's warmer, but it still goes through periods of cold and stuff.
[00:52:09] Abby Jorgensen: All right.
[00:52:10] Gerard Donnelly: Well, if you want, just let him on the treadmill whilst he's dealing with that, but he needs to fix the problem rather than just band-aid it.
[00:52:18] Abby Jorgensen: Yeah.
[00:52:19] Abby Jorgensen: He's going to try to see somebody this week, he said, to make sure it's nothing.
[00:52:24] Abby Jorgensen: He doesn't think it is anything serious, but he wants to make sure.
[00:52:30] Gerard Donnelly: Okay.
[00:52:32] Gerard Donnelly: Philippe.
[00:52:33] Gerard Donnelly: He's doing really good.
[00:52:35] Abby Jorgensen: I love him.
[00:52:38] Abby Jorgensen: That's great.
[00:52:40] Abby Jorgensen: Yeah.
[00:52:40] Abby Jorgensen: Just every weekend he goes skiing.
[00:52:43] Abby Jorgensen: we.
[00:52:45] Abby Jorgensen: Yep.
[00:52:47] Abby Jorgensen: So.
[00:52:49] Gerard Donnelly: He's gone from 220 to 270.
[00:52:52] Gerard Donnelly: Yeah.
[00:52:53] Abby Jorgensen: And he got a new bike.
[00:52:57] Abby Jorgensen: Oh, good.
[00:52:58] Abby Jorgensen: Same pedals.
[00:53:00] Abby Jorgensen: He said everything.
[00:53:01] Abby Jorgensen: He just moved them.
[00:53:02] Abby Jorgensen: So.
[00:53:05] Abby Jorgensen: Yeah.
[00:53:06] Abby Jorgensen: He says he can't wait to actually ride it outside.
[00:53:09] Abby Jorgensen: Yes.
[00:53:10] Abby Jorgensen: Yeah.
[00:53:10] Abby Jorgensen: So.
[00:53:12] Gerard Donnelly: Yeah.
[00:53:12] Gerard Donnelly: Good.
[00:53:13] Gerard Donnelly: All right.
[00:53:13] Gerard Donnelly: So you're happy with him.
[00:53:14] Gerard Donnelly: Yep.
[00:53:15] Gerard Donnelly: Aaron back on track.
[00:53:17] Abby Jorgensen: He is back on track.
[00:53:18] Abby Jorgensen: But then she leaves the Saturday for you guys.
[00:53:21] Abby Jorgensen: She goes back to Australia for the holidays.
[00:53:23] Abby Jorgensen: So is she?
[00:53:24] Abby Jorgensen: Is she bringing a bike or?
[00:53:27] Abby Jorgensen: No, but she said she'll find a I mean, a gym and everything.
[00:53:32] Abby Jorgensen: How long is she in Australia for?
[00:53:34] Gerard Donnelly: Four weeks.
[00:53:35] Gerard Donnelly: Yep.
[00:53:37] Gerard Donnelly: That's a great test.
[00:53:38] Gerard Donnelly: She's jumped up from September back to 217 to 230.
[00:53:44] Gerard Donnelly: She's nowhere near her 260.
[00:53:48] Abby Jorgensen: She's happy with at least where she's at.
[00:53:50] Abby Jorgensen: She knows.
[00:53:51] Abby Jorgensen: Yep.
[00:53:52] Gerard Donnelly: She's consistent again and she's feeling good.
[00:53:54] Abby Jorgensen: So.
[00:53:55] Gerard Donnelly: What a pity when she's here.
[00:53:57] Gerard Donnelly: She can't bring a bike and she can race.
[00:54:01] Gerard Donnelly: Where is she flying to, Sydney?
[00:54:03] Gerard Donnelly: I believe Sydney is where she's originally from.
[00:54:08] Gerard Donnelly: Yep.
[00:54:08] Gerard Donnelly: All right.
[00:54:09] Gerard Donnelly: So I'm sure you'll sort that out.
[00:54:13] Abby Jorgensen: Yep.
[00:54:15] Gerard Donnelly: Yep.
[00:54:16] Gerard Donnelly: Great.
[00:54:16] Gerard Donnelly: Riley?
[00:54:18] Gerard Donnelly: Also doing very well.
[00:54:21] Abby Jorgensen: Just everything I tell him to do.
[00:54:23] Abby Jorgensen: And he's jumped up quite a bit.
[00:54:26] Gerard Donnelly: 170 to 230.
[00:54:28] Gerard Donnelly: Oh, my goodness.
[00:54:30] Gerard Donnelly: Yeah.
[00:54:31] Abby Jorgensen: like all his sessions, he's, you know, usually right at the higher end range.
[00:54:40] Gerard Donnelly: It's great when they're compliant, isn't it?
[00:54:43] Abby Jorgensen: Yeah.
[00:54:43] Abby Jorgensen: Makes my job easy.
[00:54:44] Abby Jorgensen: Yeah.
[00:54:45] Abby Jorgensen: Yeah.
[00:54:46] Gerard Donnelly: And, you know, half the reason is because of the way you keep in contact with them, Abby.
[00:54:52] Gerard Donnelly: Don't underestimate how important what you're doing is making them, you know.
[00:54:58] Abby Jorgensen: I I know.
[00:54:59] Abby Jorgensen: know.
[00:54:59] Abby Jorgensen: I know.
[00:55:00] Gerard Donnelly: That you're watching.
[00:55:02] Gerard Donnelly: It's quite a shock to me when, you know, the difference if I drop the ball and don't look, they also know that I'm not looking, you know, and they don't have as much motivation to do it, which is wrong.
[00:55:22] Gerard Donnelly: So he's right at the top of the ranges.
[00:55:25] Gerard Donnelly: He should smash this FTP that he's doing this week.
[00:55:30] Gerard Donnelly: That's great.
[00:55:34] Gerard Donnelly: Okay.
[00:55:35] Gerard Donnelly: Oh, good old Peter.
[00:55:36] Abby Jorgensen: Peter, he literally just texted me that he got food poisoning on Friday.
[00:55:45] Abby Jorgensen: But he also has been using an old watch that doesn't sync to TrainingPeaks as good because his other watch, he doesn't have a, he lost the charger for his other watch.
[00:55:57] Abby Jorgensen: Yes.
[00:55:58] Abby Jorgensen: So everything.
[00:55:59] Abby Jorgensen: everything.
[00:56:00] Abby Jorgensen: Oh, like download.
[00:56:01] Abby Jorgensen: Like a week later, I'll get an email and I'll be like, that was from a week ago.
[00:56:05] Abby Jorgensen: So it's not.
[00:56:07] Abby Jorgensen: But he's going be traveling.
[00:56:08] Abby Jorgensen: So I was going to test him.
[00:56:10] Abby Jorgensen: He's like, let's just wait till I get back from California over the holidays because there's no point in testing until he comes back.
[00:56:18] Gerard Donnelly: Does most of you have a holiday from Friday through to Monday?
[00:56:26] Gerard Donnelly: It just depends on the person's work.
[00:56:28] Abby Jorgensen: Yeah.
[00:56:29] Abby Jorgensen: I mean, yeah.
[00:56:31] Abby Jorgensen: I mean, everybody's different with like, it's not like a mandated you have to have this off.
[00:56:39] Abby Jorgensen: I wish it was.
[00:56:43] Abby Jorgensen: Yeah.
[00:56:45] Abby Jorgensen: Depends on how much they have.
[00:56:47] Abby Jorgensen: Dan?
[00:56:48] Abby Jorgensen: Dan is good.
[00:56:50] Abby Jorgensen: He did have a, he had a crash a couple weeks ago.
[00:56:55] Abby Jorgensen: Yeah.
[00:56:55] Abby Jorgensen: Okay.
[00:56:55] Abby Jorgensen: But two weeks ago, and he's had.
[00:57:00] Abby Jorgensen: He's some issues since with his left leg just feels funny when he runs.
[00:57:04] Abby Jorgensen: So we're watching that.
[00:57:06] Abby Jorgensen: But other than that, he's compliant as well.
[00:57:10] Abby Jorgensen: So he had had a swim lesson and the guy told him he just needs more shoulder and upper back mobility.
[00:57:19] Abby Jorgensen: So he's been working on that.
[00:57:23] Gerard Donnelly: That's really helpful, isn't it?
[00:57:24] Gerard Donnelly: That's good.
[00:57:27] Abby Jorgensen: Jane?
[00:57:28] Abby Jorgensen: No, we don't want to.
[00:57:30] Abby Jorgensen: Well, she traveled back to Vancouver, yeah.
[00:57:34] Abby Jorgensen: And then she immediately left for London.
[00:57:38] Abby Jorgensen: And she told me, she's like, don't expect me to really, I'm going to be with friends and we'll do exercise classes and do some other things, but I probably won't be like, have my watch and stuff like that.
[00:57:50] Abby Jorgensen: So I was like, all right.
[00:57:52] Abby Jorgensen: And when did she come back?
[00:57:55] Gerard Donnelly: The 18th.
[00:57:57] Abby Jorgensen: Of January?
[00:57:59] Gerard Donnelly: Yeah.
[00:57:59] Gerard Donnelly: No.
[00:57:59] Abby Jorgensen: However, the
[00:58:00] Abby Jorgensen: December, and then she's back home, and then she leaves again.
[00:58:03] Abby Jorgensen: She has a New York trip at some point as well.
[00:58:06] Gerard Donnelly: She's back in Canada, and then when does she come back to Australia?
[00:58:12] Abby Jorgensen: Not till the end of January, I believe.
[00:58:15] Abby Jorgensen: Yeah, okay.
[00:58:16] Gerard Donnelly: Well, that's a challenge for you.
[00:58:20] Gerard Donnelly: She's been so ordinary as a trainer, hasn't she?
[00:58:26] Gerard Donnelly: And her mom is not.
[00:58:28] Abby Jorgensen: Her mom tries to do as much as she can.
[00:58:33] Gerard Donnelly: So your challenge is to convince her that consistency of just doing, you know, just do a run.
[00:58:41] Gerard Donnelly: Just keep your running going.
[00:58:42] Gerard Donnelly: Go and have fun with the classes with your friends.
[00:58:44] Gerard Donnelly: Absolutely.
[00:58:45] Gerard Donnelly: Have fun.
[00:58:46] Gerard Donnelly: But make sure you go for a 20 or 30-minute run every second day.
[00:58:50] Gerard Donnelly: That's something you can do, Jen.
[00:58:53] Gerard Donnelly: You know, let's get your running going.
[00:58:56] Gerard Donnelly: And if you get an opportunity to jump on a gym bike, great.
[00:58:58] Gerard Donnelly: But I would be...
[00:59:00] Gerard Donnelly: Really pushing that.
[00:59:02] Gerard Donnelly: And, you know, down the track she'll be really so happy she did because this is a time where she's got most of the time free and, you know, she can't train because she works so much and now she's got the time off and she's still trying to have – it's like, why have you got a program?
[00:59:22] Abby Jorgensen: Yeah.
[00:59:22] Abby Jorgensen: Really strange, isn't it?
[00:59:24] Abby Jorgensen: Yeah, it's really strange.
[00:59:25] Abby Jorgensen: Anyway, that's your challenge, that one.
[00:59:28] Abby Jorgensen: Well, I mean, I lost Isabel, so I needed another challenge.
[00:59:32] Gerard Donnelly: Hey, I don't know how you possibly kept her for that long.
[00:59:36] Abby Jorgensen: I mean, I don't know how she completed – I mean, she completed that 70.3, not terribly, actually, so.
[00:59:43] Gerard Donnelly: It was pretty terrible.
[00:59:45] Abby Jorgensen: I mean, yeah, but considering – I mean – Seven hours, oh my goodness.
[00:59:52] Gerard Donnelly: I mean, her bike and swim weren't bad.
[00:59:54] Abby Jorgensen: Her run is her run, so.
[00:59:56] Abby Jorgensen: Yeah.
[00:59:57] Abby Jorgensen: Yeah.
[00:59:58] Abby Jorgensen: Jeez, beautiful.
[01:00:00] Gerard Donnelly: Bill's nailing it.
[01:00:02] Abby Jorgensen: Yeah, we took out, up until now, until Christmas, I took out double sessions because it was just with work and holidays and Christmas parties.
[01:00:11] Abby Jorgensen: He was like, I can't do all of it.
[01:00:15] Abby Jorgensen: It's fine.
[01:00:18] Abby Jorgensen: Yeah, he lost a little bit.
[01:00:20] Abby Jorgensen: Like last week, had a moment of lost motivation because it was, what, 30?
[01:00:25] Abby Jorgensen: It got cold there, which for them is 30, so it's a garage.
[01:00:30] Abby Jorgensen: It's super cold.
[01:00:31] Abby Jorgensen: And I was like, hey, you want to come here?
[01:00:33] Abby Jorgensen: But I also don't train in my garage, so I don't have a garage.
[01:00:41] Abby Jorgensen: Yeah, don't, people, when I tell people, like, what the temperature is, it's hard.
[01:00:45] Abby Jorgensen: It's hard to imagine it until you've been in negative 28 seconds or whatever.
[01:00:52] Gerard Donnelly: I was just looking at his FTP from back in November.
[01:00:59] Gerard Donnelly: Like, he's sort of...
[01:00:59] Gerard Donnelly: of...
[01:01:00] Gerard Donnelly: He's stagnating a bit, but I think he's the opposite.
[01:01:02] Gerard Donnelly: He's starting too low, I reckon, Abby.
[01:01:06] Gerard Donnelly: He ended up with 292.
[01:01:07] Gerard Donnelly: He started 282 and ended up at 311.
[01:01:10] Abby Jorgensen: I told him to start his last test, he failed.
[01:01:13] Abby Jorgensen: So we started conservative on purpose.
[01:01:16] Abby Jorgensen: Great.
[01:01:16] Abby Jorgensen: Okay.
[01:01:17] Abby Jorgensen: That's fine.
[01:01:18] Abby Jorgensen: Yeah, because he wasn't confident.
[01:01:22] Abby Jorgensen: So he struggles with that threshold stuff.
[01:01:25] Abby Jorgensen: He does.
[01:01:27] Gerard Donnelly: And that's where you can say, hey, we need to work on this.
[01:01:30] Gerard Donnelly: The sport you're in is threshold, riding.
[01:01:34] Gerard Donnelly: We really need to embrace it.
[01:01:37] Gerard Donnelly: But yeah, that tactic was exactly right, Abby.
[01:01:40] Gerard Donnelly: So what I just said, disregard.
[01:01:42] Gerard Donnelly: But if you want to see improvement, you need to start higher.
[01:01:49] Gerard Donnelly: Okay.
[01:01:50] Gerard Donnelly: We talked about Albert.
[01:01:51] Gerard Donnelly: We don't need to revisit Albert.
[01:01:53] Gerard Donnelly: Oh, yeah, we're good.
[01:01:55] Gerard Donnelly: So Karen, good talking about people you really enjoy.
[01:01:58] Gerard Donnelly: Thank you.
[01:02:00] Abby Jorgensen: Yeah, she just, after the half marathon, she was just really tired and fatigued and work got busy, so I let her do that.
[01:02:09] Abby Jorgensen: She did do the FTP test for me.
[01:02:13] Abby Jorgensen: Improvement there.
[01:02:14] Abby Jorgensen: Yeah, what did she do?
[01:02:17] Gerard Donnelly: Is it not?
[01:02:19] Abby Jorgensen: Yeah, she's 20, 25 watts.
[01:02:22] Abby Jorgensen: Her cadence is still a little low, I believe.
[01:02:24] Abby Jorgensen: 68, oh my God.
[01:02:27] Abby Jorgensen: 68.
[01:02:28] Abby Jorgensen: 68.
[01:02:28] Abby Jorgensen: Yeah.
[01:02:29] Abby Jorgensen: But some of the other ones, she's getting her cadence up, so I think it's just a matter of...
[01:02:33] Abby Jorgensen: Hey, why did she start at 1.30, Abby?
[01:02:36] Gerard Donnelly: That was gutsy.
[01:02:38] Gerard Donnelly: Yeah, I don't know.
[01:02:39] Abby Jorgensen: Oh my God.
[01:02:40] Gerard Donnelly: Like, her last test was 1.06.
[01:02:43] Abby Jorgensen: Yeah, I don't know if the last test was as indicative of what she's capable of.
[01:02:51] Abby Jorgensen: Yes.
[01:02:51] Abby Jorgensen: After seeing some of her other sessions.
[01:02:54] Abby Jorgensen: Yes.
[01:02:56] Abby Jorgensen: Yeah.
[01:02:58] Gerard Donnelly: Do you think?
[01:02:58] Gerard Donnelly: think?
[01:02:58] Gerard Donnelly: think?
[01:02:59] Gerard Donnelly: think?
[01:02:59] Gerard Donnelly: Do Do Do you.
[01:03:01] Gerard Donnelly: Do you think she's looking at the lap power as she's going?
[01:03:08] Abby Jorgensen: She might be.
[01:03:09] Abby Jorgensen: I know she just struggles with technology in general.
[01:03:14] Gerard Donnelly: That's a bit of a challenge for you is to make sure that because if an athlete starts there, I would be saying, oh, you know, your last test was 106.
[01:03:24] Gerard Donnelly: You started at 130.
[01:03:25] Gerard Donnelly: But, you know, did you know that?
[01:03:30] Gerard Donnelly: And it's going to be, oh, I didn't realize.
[01:03:32] Gerard Donnelly: Then I'd be saying, oh, are you looking at, you know, lap average power on your bike screen?
[01:03:37] Gerard Donnelly: So it opens up a good conversation about what are you actually looking at?
[01:03:42] Gerard Donnelly: I know she uses TrainingPeaks Virtual.
[01:03:46] Abby Jorgensen: Because TrainingPeaks Virtuals have some issues of upload issues occasionally.
[01:03:50] Abby Jorgensen: Do they?
[01:03:51] Abby Jorgensen: But they've got lap power on the screen, which is good.
[01:03:53] Abby Jorgensen: They do, which is nice.
[01:03:55] Abby Jorgensen: But I always I've learned now to, you know, make sure you have.
[01:04:00] Abby Jorgensen: Two things going otherwise.
[01:04:02] Abby Jorgensen: TrainingPeaks.
[01:04:04] Abby Jorgensen: That was the one that it uploaded.
[01:04:07] Abby Jorgensen: She even screenshotted it to me.
[01:04:08] Abby Jorgensen: She sent an email to him and everything.
[01:04:10] Abby Jorgensen: But yeah, her mom fell and broke her hip.
[01:04:18] Abby Jorgensen: And she was like, now my dad's in the hospital.
[01:04:21] Abby Jorgensen: And I was like, oh, Lord.
[01:04:22] Abby Jorgensen: Yeah, just probably that age too.
[01:04:26] Gerard Donnelly: So yeah, sometimes during this period, if you feel that you want to pull back on some athletes, just give them some more zone two and three sessions and tell them, you know, we don't want to push it too hard during this period.
[01:04:41] Gerard Donnelly: If you feel that athlete needs it like it.
[01:04:44] Gerard Donnelly: Okay.
[01:04:45] Abby Jorgensen: Yeah.
[01:04:45] Abby Jorgensen: She took her trainer and the bike with her.
[01:04:47] Abby Jorgensen: So she said when, when she has time, when they're sleeping or doesn't need help, she'll try to fit in a session.
[01:04:54] Abby Jorgensen: So yeah.
[01:04:56] Gerard Donnelly: Um, and then that's Scott.
[01:04:59] Gerard Donnelly: So
[01:05:01] Gerard Donnelly: So you can see how very little he's been doing.
[01:05:07] Gerard Donnelly: So his total for the week is an hour, I think.
[01:05:11] Abby Jorgensen: It looks like more than that.
[01:05:15] Gerard Donnelly: So he's done 15K on the bike and he's done 5K of running.
[01:05:22] Gerard Donnelly: In some weeks he's done nothing.
[01:05:27] Gerard Donnelly: So that gives you an idea of how, you know, there's just not much happening.
[01:05:34] Gerard Donnelly: So we would try and spread the test out.
[01:05:37] Gerard Donnelly: You know, get him to have a practice session.
[01:05:41] Gerard Donnelly: Like he actually already has.
[01:05:43] Gerard Donnelly: So, yeah, so he's already using, he's either using TrainingPeaks or Zwift, I'm not sure.
[01:05:54] Gerard Donnelly: Zwift, there it is, yeah.
[01:06:02] Gerard Donnelly: Yeah, so cadence is a bit of an issue, isn't it?
[01:06:06] Gerard Donnelly: I find that a lot with beginners, I think.
[01:06:09] Abby Jorgensen: Yeah.
[01:06:10] Gerard Donnelly: I was even the same way.
[01:06:11] Abby Jorgensen: Yeah.
[01:06:13] Abby Jorgensen: I think I was as well.
[01:06:15] Abby Jorgensen: It just feels better, slower, I guess.
[01:06:17] Abby Jorgensen: Yeah.
[01:06:18] Abby Jorgensen: Heart rate doesn't jump as high, I guess.
[01:06:20] Abby Jorgensen: I can't remember.
[01:06:22] Gerard Donnelly: I think you can run.
[01:06:23] Gerard Donnelly: I can't remember.
[01:06:25] Abby Jorgensen: Looks like 20 minutes for 4K.
[01:06:30] Abby Jorgensen: Yeah.
[01:06:31] Abby Jorgensen: Sometimes I just look up this.
[01:06:36] Gerard Donnelly: So, you know, he has done 163 for 20 minutes, 149, and that's what he just did on Monday.
[01:06:45] Gerard Donnelly: So he's already done, you know, given his FTP test.
[01:06:49] Gerard Donnelly: And it's a long time since he's actually run 10K or 5K.
[01:06:57] Gerard Donnelly: So, yeah, have a discussion about that.
[01:07:00] Gerard Donnelly: Um, it's not necessary that we have to test him as a runner.
[01:07:05] Gerard Donnelly: He's just not, it's, he's going to be a completely different athlete, Abby.
[01:07:10] Gerard Donnelly: It's not so much about improvement.
[01:07:12] Gerard Donnelly: It's more about just consistently training, um, with the- that a race scheduled or anything?
[01:07:19] Abby Jorgensen: Say that again?
[01:07:20] Gerard Donnelly: Does Scott have a race he's going to do?
[01:07:23] Abby Jorgensen: No.
[01:07:23] Abby Jorgensen: No.
[01:07:25] Gerard Donnelly: Um, I could, uh, Let me check.
[01:07:50] Gerard Donnelly: I'm just going to his goals.
[01:07:58] Gerard Donnelly: Short-term goals.
[01:07:59] Gerard Donnelly: Sustainable.
[01:08:00] Gerard Donnelly: consistent training for six months.
[01:08:03] Gerard Donnelly: Complete a year of steady progress rather than rapid build followed by burnout.
[01:08:08] Gerard Donnelly: Finish top half of my age group in a sprint triathlon.
[01:08:12] Gerard Donnelly: Okay.
[01:08:13] Gerard Donnelly: Sub 20 minute, 750 open water swim, long term goals.
[01:08:23] Gerard Donnelly: Wants to do longer races.
[01:08:26] Gerard Donnelly: Calendar.
[01:08:27] Gerard Donnelly: I have no races booked for 2026.
[01:08:30] Gerard Donnelly: I'd like some guidance before committing.
[01:08:33] Gerard Donnelly: Oh yeah.
[01:08:34] Gerard Donnelly: He told me there was some races in Wales that he likes to do.
[01:08:37] Gerard Donnelly: I looked them up.
[01:08:38] Gerard Donnelly: There were three races, snowman, state man, and you'll get a copy of this anyway.
[01:08:46] Gerard Donnelly: Yeah, he's really, he's really looking to us.
[01:08:49] Gerard Donnelly: Work the 5th of 9th of January.
[01:08:51] Gerard Donnelly: You'll be in Boston.
[01:08:54] Gerard Donnelly: Returns training by the 12th.
[01:09:01] Gerard Donnelly: Why do you want to coach?
[01:09:03] Gerard Donnelly: Long history of self-moderating my training and goals well.
[01:09:06] Gerard Donnelly: So I build for around half the year, maybe less, too hard, too fast, and then burn out.
[01:09:10] Gerard Donnelly: I need help to achieve longer-term results by making better decisions about goals and training in the short term.
[01:09:17] Gerard Donnelly: So his real message was he's sick of this over-under type of training.
[01:09:25] Gerard Donnelly: So it'll be more about less is better, Abby, for him.
[01:09:30] Gerard Donnelly: Okay.
[01:09:32] Abby Jorgensen: Do you think, like, a run-walk program, or no, just, like, 20 seconds?
[01:09:40] Gerard Donnelly: Let's just see.
[01:09:41] Gerard Donnelly: Like, he's done one run, one run, no, no running, no running for three weeks, no running, four weeks, and then he's run twice.
[01:09:54] Gerard Donnelly: Let's, yeah, walk, run might be the thing.
[01:09:58] Gerard Donnelly: thing.
[01:10:00] Gerard Donnelly: That might be.
[01:10:02] Gerard Donnelly: He's in the UK, which is obviously, you know, not as where you are.
[01:10:07] Gerard Donnelly: It's a lot colder and wetter, but it can get snow and wet and cold.
[01:10:14] Gerard Donnelly: So he could be on a treadmill anyway.
[01:10:16] Gerard Donnelly: So just suss all that out.
[01:10:18] Gerard Donnelly: But I think, you know, two rides in two runs would be.
[01:10:27] Gerard Donnelly: And has he done any swimming?
[01:10:31] Gerard Donnelly: I saw a couple in there.
[01:10:33] Abby Jorgensen: Yeah.
[01:10:33] Abby Jorgensen: So maybe one swim.
[01:10:37] Abby Jorgensen: And then.
[01:10:39] Abby Jorgensen: I can't see too much swimming.
[01:10:41] Gerard Donnelly: Looks like he's done maybe.
[01:10:48] Abby Jorgensen: Some strength, maybe.
[01:10:50] Abby Jorgensen: There's one.
[01:10:51] Gerard Donnelly: 700 metres.
[01:10:53] Gerard Donnelly: I don't think we need to test him.
[01:10:57] Gerard Donnelly: I'm the swimming.
[01:11:00] Gerard Donnelly: Run.
[01:11:00] Gerard Donnelly: Just test him on the bike.
[01:11:03] Gerard Donnelly: And tell him why.
[01:11:07] Gerard Donnelly: We're not going to be running hard.
[01:11:08] Gerard Donnelly: We're not going to be running a lot.
[01:11:10] Gerard Donnelly: We're just going to get you running.
[01:11:11] Gerard Donnelly: So there's no need for us to find out where your running pace is.
[01:11:18] Gerard Donnelly: Same with swimming.
[01:11:19] Gerard Donnelly: just want you to, any swim we give you, you know, just think about your technique rather than vlogging yourself, trying to sprint.
[01:11:29] Gerard Donnelly: Tell him not to worry about the times we give him in those swim sessions.
[01:11:32] Gerard Donnelly: It's just not relevant.
[01:11:34] Gerard Donnelly: Yeah.
[01:11:34] Gerard Donnelly: Yeah, we put them in there because TrainingPeaks asks us to do something.
[01:11:37] Gerard Donnelly: can't just have blanks.
[01:11:38] Gerard Donnelly: So, but yeah, please don't worry about the swim paces.
[01:11:43] Gerard Donnelly: Just get that message across.
[01:11:48] Gerard Donnelly: Any questions on him?
[01:11:50] Gerard Donnelly: No.
[01:11:51] Abby Jorgensen: I'll hopefully get the video I can watch.
[01:11:55] Abby Jorgensen: It's 10 o'clock, so it's 7 a.m.
[01:11:57] Gerard Donnelly: where Floyd is.
[01:11:59] Gerard Donnelly: So she must be getting...
[01:12:00] Gerard Donnelly: up soon.
[01:12:02] Abby Jorgensen: What's the one thing I've liked about my new schedule?
[01:12:06] Abby Jorgensen: I only like I'll coach tomorrow morning early.
[01:12:09] Abby Jorgensen: But other than that, I like sleeping in until seven.
[01:12:14] Gerard Donnelly: It's such a change for you.
[01:12:17] Abby Jorgensen: Kind of nice.
[01:12:19] Abby Jorgensen: Has your HRV improved because you're getting better sleep?
[01:12:22] Gerard Donnelly: Is my what?
[01:12:24] Abby Jorgensen: Your HRV improved?
[01:12:26] Abby Jorgensen: It's gone up since this last couple months.
[01:12:29] Abby Jorgensen: It's been better.
[01:12:32] Abby Jorgensen: So yeah, you do a sleep and then I don't know.
[01:12:35] Abby Jorgensen: Yeah.
[01:12:36] Abby Jorgensen: So many other factors, but it's back up in the 80s, 70s and 80s.
[01:12:43] Abby Jorgensen: Oh, my dream.
[01:12:46] Abby Jorgensen: It was like right before the Ironman.
[01:12:48] Abby Jorgensen: was like 88, 90, something like that on average.
[01:12:51] Abby Jorgensen: Wow.
[01:12:52] Abby Jorgensen: And then it tanked.
[01:12:54] Abby Jorgensen: What did it get down to?
[01:12:56] Gerard Donnelly: What was your lowest?
[01:12:57] Gerard Donnelly: Well, the day after it was like...
[01:14:00] Gerard Donnelly: I could not face food.
[01:14:01] Gerard Donnelly: There was no way I could eat.
[01:14:03] Abby Jorgensen: I've never had, knock on wood, never had food poisoning.
[01:14:06] Abby Jorgensen: So if someone says to you they think they've got food poisoning.
[01:14:11] Abby Jorgensen: I mean, I've got people with it.
[01:14:13] Abby Jorgensen: I don't, I don't ever wish it on myself.
[01:14:16] Abby Jorgensen: That's for sure.
[01:14:18] Gerard Donnelly: You seriously want someone to shoot you because you just, you feel nauseous and you've got diarrhea and vomiting and it's no good.
[01:14:30] Gerard Donnelly: The trouble is, if you don't eat, you have no fuel to train and you don't feel like training anyway.
[01:14:37] Gerard Donnelly: But if you wanted to exercise, you basically can't because you've got, if you want to burn fat stores, I suppose you could.
[01:14:45] Gerard Donnelly: But, you know, I lost four kilos.
[01:14:50] Abby Jorgensen: That's what, eight pounds, nine pounds?
[01:14:52] Abby Jorgensen: In four days.
[01:14:55] Abby Jorgensen: It's like cutting for a fight.
[01:14:58] Abby Jorgensen: I've kept it off.
[01:14:59] Gerard Donnelly: I'm really happy.
[01:15:01] Abby Jorgensen: I had to do that once.
[01:15:03] Abby Jorgensen: I did MMA for a time.
[01:15:06] Abby Jorgensen: I had to cut like 10 pounds in a week.
[01:15:09] Abby Jorgensen: In a week?
[01:15:10] Abby Jorgensen: Yeah, it was not fun.
[01:15:12] Abby Jorgensen: Because females don't do that very easily.
[01:15:15] Abby Jorgensen: I'm pretty low body fat to begin with.
[01:15:17] Abby Jorgensen: So you just not eat?
[01:15:19] Abby Jorgensen: Basically, yeah.
[01:15:23] Gerard Donnelly: Well, that's harder.
[01:15:25] Gerard Donnelly: That's way harder because you've still got an appetite.
[01:15:28] Gerard Donnelly: Whereas when you've got food poisoning, your appetite is so zero.
[01:15:33] Gerard Donnelly: You don't want to.
[01:15:35] Gerard Donnelly: Whereas, you know, you're functioning normally.
[01:15:41] Abby Jorgensen: Yeah.
[01:15:42] Abby Jorgensen: All right.
[01:15:43] Gerard Donnelly: Anything else you want to discuss, Abby?
[01:15:46] Abby Jorgensen: Oh, I think that's it.
[01:15:49] Abby Jorgensen: Yeah, we're just kind of in this period.
[01:15:52] Abby Jorgensen: I just listened to the podcast this morning.
[01:15:55] Abby Jorgensen: The Christmas one?
[01:15:56] Abby Jorgensen: The Christmas one, yeah.
[01:15:58] Abby Jorgensen: Did that come across okay?
[01:15:59] Gerard Donnelly: Yeah.
[01:16:01] Abby Jorgensen: I can't listen to them.
[01:16:04] Gerard Donnelly: Why?
[01:16:06] Gerard Donnelly: I can't stand hearing my voice.
[01:16:10] Abby Jorgensen: I get it.
[01:16:11] Abby Jorgensen: I don't like to hear mine either.
[01:16:14] Gerard Donnelly: I just want to make sure that we're making it easier for our coaches when we try to give people motivation to use this period rather than slacking off or doing too much, but really making people.
[01:16:29] Gerard Donnelly: So you don't have to keep explaining what the goal is here.
[01:16:33] Gerard Donnelly: Yeah.
[01:16:33] Abby Jorgensen: No, I mean, obviously, most of my athletes are North American, and we don't exactly have the same skill as you guys.
[01:16:41] Abby Jorgensen: I wish we did, but, yeah.
[01:16:44] Abby Jorgensen: Yeah.
[01:16:45] Abby Jorgensen: I mean, yeah, I'm not going anywhere for Christmas.
[01:16:48] Abby Jorgensen: I'll go to my parents, which is a 90-minute drive, but other than that, I'll probably still train that morning and everything.
[01:16:54] Abby Jorgensen: Yeah.
[01:16:55] Abby Jorgensen: Okay.
[01:16:57] Gerard Donnelly: That's good to know.
[01:16:58] Abby Jorgensen: Yeah.
[01:16:58] Abby Jorgensen: I don't have a whole.
[01:17:00] Gerard Donnelly: Now, I am determined, Abby, to get a routine, and it's not your fault.
[01:17:08] Gerard Donnelly: It's totally my fault.
[01:17:09] Abby Jorgensen: It's hard when we're a day apart.
[01:17:13] Abby Jorgensen: I know.
[01:17:13] Gerard Donnelly: So is Monday night a good night?
[01:17:16] Gerard Donnelly: Because I could do Tuesday mornings every week.
[01:17:19] Gerard Donnelly: That would be fine.
[01:17:20] Abby Jorgensen: Yeah, Mondays are good.
[01:17:22] Abby Jorgensen: I don't have anything.
[01:17:25] Abby Jorgensen: Like I said, if I coach now, it's like nine and noon, and on that, I leave my Mondays.
[01:17:30] Abby Jorgensen: It's pretty wide open.
[01:17:32] Abby Jorgensen: There's some way I can make this recurring, isn't there?
[01:17:34] Gerard Donnelly: How do I do that?
[01:17:36] Gerard Donnelly: Do you know how to do that?
[01:17:38] Gerard Donnelly: In a way.
[01:17:47] Gerard Donnelly: That's not repeat.
[01:17:48] Gerard Donnelly: There it is.
[01:17:49] Gerard Donnelly: It's repeat.
[01:17:51] Gerard Donnelly: Weekly on Tuesday.
[01:17:52] Gerard Donnelly: I'll click that.
[01:17:53] Gerard Donnelly: That's right on it?
[01:17:54] Gerard Donnelly: Yeah.
[01:17:56] Gerard Donnelly: Right.
[01:17:57] Gerard Donnelly: Let's see if that's in next week.
[01:17:59] Gerard Donnelly: Thank you.
[01:17:59] Gerard Donnelly: Thank Thank
[01:18:00] Abby Jorgensen: It works good, too, because then it doesn't go into dinner and stuff for me.
[01:18:05] Gerard Donnelly: What time is it there now?
[01:18:08] Abby Jorgensen: Five o'clock.
[01:18:09] Gerard Donnelly: Okay, I can make it earlier if you want, four o'clock.
[01:18:14] Gerard Donnelly: Yeah, that usually works.
[01:18:15] Abby Jorgensen: Yeah, any time.
[01:18:16] Abby Jorgensen: When do we start?
[01:18:17] Gerard Donnelly: When do we start today?
[01:18:19] Gerard Donnelly: 3.45, my time.
[01:18:22] Abby Jorgensen: Okay, let's.
[01:18:23] Abby Jorgensen: So, yeah, four works.
[01:18:28] Abby Jorgensen: And so, like.
[01:18:31] Abby Jorgensen: Yep, okay.
[01:18:33] Abby Jorgensen: Daylight savings time, but that's not going to be for a hot minute.
[01:18:37] Abby Jorgensen: Unless you guys hit some sort of time change.
[01:18:43] Gerard Donnelly: So what did we, what did you say we started at?
[01:18:46] Gerard Donnelly: Quarter to three, was it?
[01:18:48] Gerard Donnelly: Quarter to four.
[01:18:50] Abby Jorgensen: Quarter to four.
[01:18:51] Gerard Donnelly: Yep, so we're going make it 3.30.
[01:18:54] Gerard Donnelly: Okay.
[01:18:55] Abby Jorgensen: Okay.
[01:18:56] Abby Jorgensen: That should work.
[01:18:57] Abby Jorgensen: work.
[01:19:03] Gerard Donnelly: Hi.
[01:19:04] Gerard Donnelly: Hi.
[01:19:05] Gerard Donnelly: Are you just back here?
[01:19:07] Gerard Donnelly: Yep.
[01:19:07] Gerard Donnelly: I'm just talking to Abby.
[01:19:09] Gerard Donnelly: Oh, okay.
[01:19:10] Gerard Donnelly: Alright.
[01:19:10] Gerard Donnelly: Bye.
[01:19:12] Gerard Donnelly: My wife.
[01:19:16] Gerard Donnelly: You guys going somewhere for Christmas?
[01:19:19] Abby Jorgensen: Yes.
[01:19:20] Gerard Donnelly: Jordan arrives on Friday from Bali, Perth.
[01:19:25] Gerard Donnelly: Yeah, he's in Perth right now, right?
[01:19:27] Abby Jorgensen: He's in Perth, yep.
[01:19:30] Gerard Donnelly: And his older brother Liam and Lani live in Queensland, which is a two-hour flight.
[01:19:36] Gerard Donnelly: And they're coming on Friday as well, an hour apart.
[01:19:41] Gerard Donnelly: So everybody will be here, which will be great for a week.
[01:19:47] Gerard Donnelly: They all sit there, do they?
[01:19:49] Abby Jorgensen: Is it all done?
[01:19:50] Gerard Donnelly: We've actually got about an hour's drive.
[01:19:55] Gerard Donnelly: We've got a holiday house that we've rented from one of...
[01:20:01] Gerard Donnelly: Liam's wife, Lani's auntie.
[01:20:04] Gerard Donnelly: So it's pretty, it's right on the beach.
[01:20:08] Gerard Donnelly: So we've just rented that off her.
[01:20:10] Gerard Donnelly: So everybody will go, all 14 of us.
[01:20:15] Abby Jorgensen: Do you want to meet this next Monday then or no?
[01:20:18] Abby Jorgensen: Yeah, yeah, that's okay.
[01:20:20] Abby Jorgensen: Okay.
[01:20:21] Gerard Donnelly: Yep, absolutely.
[01:20:22] Gerard Donnelly: Okay.
[01:20:28] Abby Jorgensen: Or Tuesday for you.
[01:20:29] Abby Jorgensen: Tuesday for me, yeah, that's fine.
[01:20:33] Gerard Donnelly: And if there's any, look, all throughout the year, this should be fine.
[01:20:38] Gerard Donnelly: Probably that is one of the more difficult weeks, but I still want to meet you.
[01:20:43] Gerard Donnelly: Okay.
[01:20:45] Gerard Donnelly: Let's stick with that one, Abby.
[01:20:47] Gerard Donnelly: Okay.
[01:20:48] Gerard Donnelly: And if something changes, then we can adjust.
[01:20:50] Gerard Donnelly: But at least it's set in there.
[01:20:54] Gerard Donnelly: Okay.
[01:20:54] Abby Jorgensen: I think if I accept it, then it just goes in my calendar.
[01:20:58] Abby Jorgensen: Yeah.
[01:20:59] Abby Jorgensen: Yeah.
[01:20:59] Gerard Donnelly: Yeah.
[01:21:00] Gerard Donnelly: I think.
[01:21:00] Gerard Donnelly: you get an invite?
[01:21:02] Gerard Donnelly: Yeah.
[01:21:06] Gerard Donnelly: I've flicked across three weeks in a row and it's in my calendar now.
[01:21:10] Gerard Donnelly: It's ongoing.
[01:21:12] Gerard Donnelly: I should have.
[01:21:14] Abby Jorgensen: I had my calendar up at one point.
[01:21:23] Abby Jorgensen: Great.
[01:21:26] Gerard Donnelly: All right.
[01:21:27] Gerard Donnelly: Well, it's in there.
[01:21:28] Gerard Donnelly: So.
[01:21:29] Abby Jorgensen: OK, we'll look forward to having a good week and.
[01:21:34] Gerard Donnelly: Just if you need me, yell out.
[01:21:36] Abby Jorgensen: OK, sounds good.
[01:21:38] Gerard Donnelly: Good luck with the new guy.
[01:21:41] Gerard Donnelly: OK.
[01:21:42] Abby Jorgensen: Yeah, hopefully I'll get that stuff here at some point.
[01:21:45] Abby Jorgensen: OK.
[01:21:46] Abby Jorgensen: All right.
[01:21:47] Abby Jorgensen: Have a good.
[01:21:48] Abby Jorgensen: Bye.
[01:21:58] Abby Jorgensen: Bye.
[01:21:59] Abby Jorgensen: Bye.
[01:21:59] Abby Jorgensen: You
