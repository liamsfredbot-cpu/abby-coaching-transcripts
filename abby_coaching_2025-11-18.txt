## Transcript

[00:00:00] Gerard Donnelly: Happy with your 10K?
[00:00:05] Abby Jorgensen: Yeah, I think I started off a little too hot.
[00:00:08] Abby Jorgensen: I think I was expecting more out of myself, but yeah, mean, I hung on for the most part.
[00:00:19] Gerard Donnelly: Yeah, it's interesting you run seemingly to me better off the bike than you do.
[00:00:27] Abby Jorgensen: Have you noticed?
[00:00:28] Gerard Donnelly: I have noticed.
[00:00:30] Abby Jorgensen: That's why I tried to like, I spin my leg.
[00:00:32] Abby Jorgensen: I did some, I hopped on the bike just to spin my legs before that, hoping that would help.
[00:00:38] Abby Jorgensen: But I mean, it's just so light that it didn't, by the time I drove to the location I was running to.
[00:00:46] Gerard Donnelly: Yeah, I think a great result for the FTP.
[00:00:52] Gerard Donnelly: And isn't it amazing how you don't have to actually do a lot of bike?
[00:00:56] Gerard Donnelly: Yeah.
[00:00:58] Gerard Donnelly: Yeah, I was definitely,
[00:00:59] Abby Jorgensen: was like, okay, well, we'll take this.
[00:01:03] Gerard Donnelly: Yeah.
[00:01:03] Gerard Donnelly: Yeah.
[00:01:03] Gerard Donnelly: So that was really good.
[00:01:07] Gerard Donnelly: And you're not going backwards in the run, but we're not progressing.
[00:01:12] Gerard Donnelly: And I think it's just a bit of trust in the process, Abby.
[00:01:16] Gerard Donnelly: And, you know, obviously your first half, 436 pace, which is...
[00:01:24] Gerard Donnelly: It was like a 7...
[00:01:26] Abby Jorgensen: 22, isn't it?
[00:01:28] Gerard Donnelly: Yeah.
[00:01:28] Gerard Donnelly: 722 pace.
[00:01:30] Gerard Donnelly: And then you were running more like 730 pace for the second...
[00:01:36] Gerard Donnelly: Is that right?
[00:01:36] Gerard Donnelly: The second half.
[00:01:37] Gerard Donnelly: Oh, yeah.
[00:01:43] Gerard Donnelly: What's that?
[00:01:48] Gerard Donnelly: Right.
[00:01:51] Gerard Donnelly: That's 726 pace.
[00:01:56] Gerard Donnelly: So, I think...
[00:01:59] Gerard Donnelly: think...
[00:02:00] Gerard Donnelly: I think if we just give yourself more chance, and I know you can run these times because you've done it, but just make the first one.
[00:02:11] Gerard Donnelly: And I think what I was going to say was, let me get back to the page, sorry.
[00:02:19] Gerard Donnelly: You know it was a little windy too, but not me.
[00:02:21] Abby Jorgensen: And you did a lot of U-turns.
[00:02:23] Gerard Donnelly: Yeah, I did that.
[00:02:26] Gerard Donnelly: To try to not hit that hill, which is fair enough.
[00:02:32] Gerard Donnelly: And, yeah, I think try to get a better course.
[00:02:35] Gerard Donnelly: I'd like you to see if you can pick out some fun runs, some races that are coming out.
[00:02:44] Gerard Donnelly: And let's get some events where you're not doing it solo, okay?
[00:02:48] Gerard Donnelly: Okay.
[00:02:50] Abby Jorgensen: The next time we test, I want you in an event.
[00:02:53] Gerard Donnelly: Okay.
[00:02:54] Gerard Donnelly: If you can find one.
[00:02:55] Abby Jorgensen: Yeah, this might be the tough time of year to find.
[00:02:59] Abby Jorgensen: Yeah.
[00:02:59] Abby Jorgensen: I mean...
[00:03:00] Abby Jorgensen: There's the Turkey Trot next week because it's Thanksgiving, but other than that.
[00:03:06] Gerard Donnelly: How far is that one?
[00:03:08] Abby Jorgensen: Usually they have like a 5K or a 5 mile version.
[00:03:12] Gerard Donnelly: I'd be really happy for you to jump in the 5K as a training session.
[00:03:17] Gerard Donnelly: Yeah, I'll see what the weather's supposed to do.
[00:03:20] Gerard Donnelly: Is that next Thursday?
[00:03:21] Gerard Donnelly: Yeah, next Thursday for us.
[00:03:24] Gerard Donnelly: Is that the 27th, is that right?
[00:03:26] Gerard Donnelly: Yeah.
[00:03:27] Abby Jorgensen: Yeah.
[00:03:31] Gerard Donnelly: I'm just going to put that in, just in case.
[00:03:37] Gerard Donnelly: I think something like that, it's fun to do.
[00:03:42] Gerard Donnelly: It's a good training session.
[00:03:44] Gerard Donnelly: Again, we're not trying to do anything outstanding here.
[00:03:48] Gerard Donnelly: I wanted to get you practiced at racing.
[00:03:53] Gerard Donnelly: And you will have, competition around you will absolutely make you run harder.
[00:03:57] Gerard Donnelly: a session.
[00:03:57] Gerard Donnelly: it's session.
[00:03:58] Gerard Donnelly: I think it's good I good it's I think it's it's
[00:04:00] Gerard Donnelly: For sure.
[00:04:02] Gerard Donnelly: You're no different to Jordan and myself.
[00:04:05] Gerard Donnelly: It's just you're competitive.
[00:04:06] Gerard Donnelly: And if you're doing it by yourself, you're trying to run against a pace, which is the hardest way to run fast.
[00:04:12] Gerard Donnelly: You can still do it.
[00:04:13] Gerard Donnelly: But if there's someone behind you and someone in front of you, it makes a hole.
[00:04:18] Abby Jorgensen: Yeah, I seem really good about that like 750 pace.
[00:04:21] Abby Jorgensen: I could probably like sit there forever.
[00:04:23] Abby Jorgensen: But yeah, it's just the faster.
[00:04:25] Abby Jorgensen: I'm just not used to running fast, I guess.
[00:04:27] Abby Jorgensen: Yeah.
[00:04:28] Gerard Donnelly: So when we're doing those Norwegian 5x6s, you know, they're the ones where if we continue to do those, and that will start to get faster.
[00:04:45] Gerard Donnelly: Ideally, Abby, I'd rather you're doing some hill efforts, but you just don't have a hill.
[00:04:52] Abby Jorgensen: Yeah, they're shorter, but they're not like going to be long enough to...
[00:04:57] Gerard Donnelly: Are they less than a minute?
[00:05:00] Gerard Donnelly: Most of them are.
[00:05:02] Abby Jorgensen: At least the ones around here.
[00:05:04] Abby Jorgensen: Like I could, I don't know.
[00:05:06] Abby Jorgensen: Yeah.
[00:05:06] Abby Jorgensen: And with the weather, it's just depends.
[00:05:09] Gerard Donnelly: So my treadmill will probably be the best bet.
[00:05:12] Gerard Donnelly: How is the weather?
[00:05:13] Gerard Donnelly: Is it getting really cold?
[00:05:15] Gerard Donnelly: It was really nice this weekend.
[00:05:17] Abby Jorgensen: So like in the 60s and 70s, but then this week looks like it's starting to cool down and rain again.
[00:05:24] Abby Jorgensen: So yeah, it just, it should start cooling down here.
[00:05:29] Abby Jorgensen: Today was just windy and it says it was in the 50s, but it did not feel 50 at all.
[00:05:35] Abby Jorgensen: Yeah.
[00:05:35] Gerard Donnelly: Okay.
[00:05:37] Gerard Donnelly: Yeah.
[00:05:38] Gerard Donnelly: That's, you know, I think, I think you've got some more speed in you.
[00:05:41] Gerard Donnelly: It's just doing it by yourself on a course where you're doing a few U-turns and, and probably start a little bit hard, put yourself under pressure.
[00:05:48] Gerard Donnelly: I think it's a whole combination of things there.
[00:05:50] Gerard Donnelly: But I want you to, I want you to warm up differently.
[00:05:53] Gerard Donnelly: Doing the warm up on the bike is great.
[00:05:55] Gerard Donnelly: That's why I put it there.
[00:05:55] Gerard Donnelly: But, but, but when you're doing the warm up, these.
[00:06:00] Gerard Donnelly: These stride-throughs, okay, they should be, you know, you should be running a five-minute mile pace in these, okay?
[00:06:11] Gerard Donnelly: So we want you, we want you really, the first one can be seven-minute mile pace for 20 seconds, the second one can be six-minute mile pace, the third one should be five-minute mile pace, okay?
[00:06:24] Gerard Donnelly: Okay.
[00:06:25] Gerard Donnelly: That's actually how they're meant to be run, and people go, oh, far out, isn't that going to, isn't that really going to tie me out?
[00:06:33] Gerard Donnelly: And yes, but give yourself enough recovery between that and starting, you know, it's only 20 seconds, you know, you're striding out for 20 seconds.
[00:06:43] Gerard Donnelly: So, so, yeah, you know, we want you to really get the feeling of, oh, far out, this is, this is like a 200, you know, or 150 meters sprint.
[00:06:57] Gerard Donnelly: We're not sprinting, but we're really trying to run hard.
[00:06:59] Gerard Donnelly: We're not sprinting.
[00:07:00] Gerard Donnelly: When you go to the race after you've had five minutes recovery, know, trying to run seven-minute mile pace feels easy after you've tried to do 20 seconds at five-minute mile pace.
[00:07:12] Gerard Donnelly: That makes sense.
[00:07:13] Gerard Donnelly: Yep.
[00:07:13] Gerard Donnelly: So you know how we do the 30-second efforts on the bike at way ridiculous once?
[00:07:20] Gerard Donnelly: It's the same.
[00:07:21] Gerard Donnelly: So you're not – can you see that?
[00:07:25] Gerard Donnelly: Your stride-throughs are slower than your actual – hey, they should be up here, all right?
[00:07:34] Gerard Donnelly: They didn't feel that way.
[00:07:36] Abby Jorgensen: Yeah, because you're still not warmed up properly.
[00:07:38] Gerard Donnelly: Yeah.
[00:07:40] Gerard Donnelly: And if I were you, you know, you only did two.
[00:07:43] Gerard Donnelly: So I want you to do three.
[00:07:45] Gerard Donnelly: I probably did three.
[00:07:46] Gerard Donnelly: do three?
[00:07:47] Gerard Donnelly: Yep, you do three.
[00:07:48] Gerard Donnelly: Okay.
[00:07:49] Gerard Donnelly: Probably – there's only two spikes, so.
[00:07:52] Gerard Donnelly: I mean, just followed the watch.
[00:07:54] Abby Jorgensen: Yes, okay.
[00:07:55] Gerard Donnelly: Well, maybe that first one is at the end of your warm-up.
[00:07:58] Gerard Donnelly: So your first one's no different.
[00:08:00] Gerard Donnelly: If that's the first one there, it's no different to your warm-up.
[00:08:04] Gerard Donnelly: You see that?
[00:08:05] Abby Jorgensen: Mm-hmm.
[00:08:06] Gerard Donnelly: So, yeah, so let's change that, okay?
[00:08:10] Gerard Donnelly: I think you need to warm up a bit more.
[00:08:12] Gerard Donnelly: And give yourself, if you want to, give yourself more time, you know?
[00:08:16] Gerard Donnelly: And also, I'm happy for you to stop the watch, Abby, and then just do 5K on its own, all right?
[00:08:23] Gerard Donnelly: Yep.
[00:08:23] Gerard Donnelly: You don't have to have the program on the watch, all right?
[00:08:27] Gerard Donnelly: You you warm up as long as you want, then you do your stride outs, you know, don't get into the habit of just using the watch as the session all the time.
[00:08:35] Gerard Donnelly: And I would be telling my athletes the same, you know?
[00:08:38] Gerard Donnelly: When you're doing a 10K time trial, a 5K time trial, a half marathon, don't load the session onto your watch.
[00:08:44] Gerard Donnelly: Just do your warm-up with your watch, and then stop it and start the next event, and then stop it, and then start your cool-down.
[00:08:53] Gerard Donnelly: Okay?
[00:08:54] Gerard Donnelly: Yep.
[00:08:56] Gerard Donnelly: All right.
[00:08:57] Gerard Donnelly: All All right.
[00:09:02] Gerard Donnelly: It's...
[00:09:03] Gerard Donnelly: what have I done?
[00:09:07] Gerard Donnelly: I'm on a different screen so it's really confusing me.
[00:09:12] Gerard Donnelly: I just want to look at what we're trying to do this week.
[00:09:15] Gerard Donnelly: So we're trying to do some steady state running and then some more Norwegian.
[00:09:21] Gerard Donnelly: So we're starting to do more interval stuff and then the hill repeats and then the long run and then the 5k run off the bike.
[00:09:27] Gerard Donnelly: I want you to really, you know, have a real good hit out there.
[00:09:31] Gerard Donnelly: So we're really stepping up your running, as you can see.
[00:09:36] Gerard Donnelly: So there's a lot more specific style of running sessions coming in now.
[00:09:39] Gerard Donnelly: I think you're well ready to do that.
[00:09:42] Gerard Donnelly: Yeah, I enjoy that stuff too.
[00:09:45] Abby Jorgensen: It makes it go by quicker.
[00:09:47] Gerard Donnelly: Yeah, and we still do the one hard bike session, okay?
[00:09:52] Gerard Donnelly: So yeah, we're going to try that three-week block of that.
[00:09:55] Gerard Donnelly: Any questions on that?
[00:09:58] Abby Jorgensen: Nope.
[00:09:59] Abby Jorgensen: Yeah, I think I was ready.
[00:10:00] Abby Jorgensen: The swimming was starting to get boring again for me, but the one a week is good.
[00:10:07] Gerard Donnelly: We really want to up your running now.
[00:10:10] Gerard Donnelly: That's our goal, is to get your mileage up, get the hard effort of the bike with the short 40-20s VO2, and then get the endurance ride with some intensity.
[00:10:23] Gerard Donnelly: And that'll really start to pay dividends.
[00:10:27] Gerard Donnelly: Okay?
[00:10:27] Gerard Donnelly: Yep.
[00:10:31] Gerard Donnelly: Okay, so let's see if I can change pages.
[00:10:44] Gerard Donnelly: What can you see there?
[00:10:47] Abby Jorgensen: Just my...
[00:10:48] Abby Jorgensen: Yep, okay.
[00:10:49] Gerard Donnelly: So I just want to quickly talk about Dan.
[00:10:54] Gerard Donnelly: I started doing a Loom video for you, but I stopped it.
[00:10:58] Gerard Donnelly: I mean...
[00:10:59] Gerard Donnelly: Yeah.
[00:11:00] Gerard Donnelly: Because there's a few things I wanted you to pick up on, okay?
[00:11:08] Gerard Donnelly: Yep.
[00:11:10] Gerard Donnelly: And again, these aren't criticisms, it's just my observations.
[00:11:13] Gerard Donnelly: So with the swim, all your observations are really good.
[00:11:20] Gerard Donnelly: There's nothing that you said that I wouldn't disagree with.
[00:11:23] Gerard Donnelly: But I would be going into his comments and saying about what I expected, a lot of work to do.
[00:11:30] Gerard Donnelly: He is certainly holding me back.
[00:11:31] Gerard Donnelly: Okay.
[00:11:31] Gerard Donnelly: I would answer that in that Loom video.
[00:11:34] Gerard Donnelly: I'd say straight away, just looking at your race, yep, it's probably what we thought.
[00:11:40] Gerard Donnelly: But if we want to get better at this, we need to send a video to Brenton and get some analysis.
[00:11:47] Gerard Donnelly: And it's a really good time to say that because he clearly sees it's holding him back.
[00:11:52] Gerard Donnelly: And so he may actually do something about it.
[00:11:56] Gerard Donnelly: He's done a couple of lessons, yeah.
[00:11:59] Abby Jorgensen: He's done something.
[00:12:00] Abby Jorgensen: Like one-on-one lessons with some people.
[00:12:02] Abby Jorgensen: Yeah.
[00:12:03] Gerard Donnelly: And tell him we've got that option with Brenton.
[00:12:05] Gerard Donnelly: You know, it's there if he wants to film himself.
[00:12:07] Gerard Donnelly: Brenton's the best analysis going around.
[00:12:10] Gerard Donnelly: So I would address that he had a panic attack.
[00:12:18] Gerard Donnelly: Did you see this?
[00:12:19] Gerard Donnelly: Yeah, he told me about it when I talked to him.
[00:12:23] Gerard Donnelly: Yeah.
[00:12:23] Gerard Donnelly: Okay.
[00:12:23] Gerard Donnelly: So you've probably already addressed it.
[00:12:25] Gerard Donnelly: Yeah.
[00:12:25] Gerard Donnelly: I'm just watching the video.
[00:12:27] Gerard Donnelly: So I would say, look, even Gerard has issues with anxiety in these swims.
[00:12:33] Gerard Donnelly: And he's done 250 races.
[00:12:35] Gerard Donnelly: And so the tactics that I would be employing is, you know, just swim to the next boy.
[00:12:40] Gerard Donnelly: Give yourself a rest.
[00:12:42] Gerard Donnelly: Do some breaststroke.
[00:12:42] Gerard Donnelly: Then swim to the next boy.
[00:12:44] Gerard Donnelly: Give yourself a rest.
[00:12:45] Gerard Donnelly: You know, give yourself a reward for hanging in there.
[00:12:48] Gerard Donnelly: Everybody gets anxiety.
[00:12:49] Gerard Donnelly: Don't think it's just you.
[00:12:51] Gerard Donnelly: I would be saying those words.
[00:12:53] Gerard Donnelly: And start to breathe out.
[00:12:55] Gerard Donnelly: You know, when your head's in the water, exhale forcefully.
[00:12:59] Gerard Donnelly: If you're.
[00:13:00] Gerard Donnelly: Dallow breathing, every time you turn to breathe, there's nothing actually to allow you to get more airing because you haven't actually exhaled the carbon dioxide.
[00:13:07] Gerard Donnelly: So I'll be thinking about that.
[00:13:11] Gerard Donnelly: Sighting issues, definitely, you know, make sure that you are spending some time continually looking and not trusting others around you.
[00:13:21] Gerard Donnelly: And I've never swung this far.
[00:13:23] Gerard Donnelly: Give him a big kudos.
[00:13:24] Gerard Donnelly: Well done for getting through it.
[00:13:25] Gerard Donnelly: And you've probably done that privately.
[00:13:28] Gerard Donnelly: These are just my observations.
[00:13:30] Gerard Donnelly: Um, so I definitely think, uh, you know, uh, there's work to be done in the swim.
[00:13:37] Gerard Donnelly: There's no doubt about that.
[00:13:38] Gerard Donnelly: Um, but I would be addressing some of those things.
[00:13:42] Gerard Donnelly: Um, again, when you open up the bike, I'll be looking at his comments, pretty close to expectations in terms of time.
[00:13:49] Gerard Donnelly: I don't know where he gets that sentence from.
[00:13:50] Gerard Donnelly: Um, on a course that was really hilly, how did he have any idea of what his time was and who cares about the story?
[00:13:58] Gerard Donnelly: it?
[00:13:58] Gerard Donnelly: Um, I would change.
[00:14:00] Gerard Donnelly: He's mindset.
[00:14:00] Gerard Donnelly: I know it's just a sentence and he probably doesn't need the context of that.
[00:14:03] Gerard Donnelly: You can read that sentence in any way you like, but I would be really honing in saying, hey, listen, you know, I'm going to explain to you a few things about how time's quite irrelevant.
[00:14:14] Gerard Donnelly: How do we get the time is what we're going to talk about in this video.
[00:14:18] Gerard Donnelly: Power-wise, it's hard to stay in the ranges and that's a really good cue for you to go, well, it's not.
[00:14:24] Gerard Donnelly: And this wasn't that hilly compared to what you've just coached Coco with at Marbella, you know, it was 1,800 metres of climbing at Marbella for 90k.
[00:14:33] Gerard Donnelly: This was 600.
[00:14:34] Gerard Donnelly: So it was a third, you know, less climbing.
[00:14:38] Gerard Donnelly: And we know any athletes that we coach who do understand how to change gears all the time, that can stay in the ranges.
[00:14:47] Gerard Donnelly: I stuck to the Power Zone 3.
[00:14:49] Gerard Donnelly: agree.
[00:14:51] Gerard Donnelly: Well, that's debatable.
[00:14:53] Gerard Donnelly: There's a lot of areas where he's above and below.
[00:14:57] Gerard Donnelly: Heart rate was good.
[00:14:57] Gerard Donnelly: I don't agree.
[00:14:59] Gerard Donnelly: His heart rate was...
[00:15:00] Gerard Donnelly: It's way above what he'd been training at.
[00:15:03] Gerard Donnelly: If you want to jump into his spreadsheet, Abby, just have a look while we're – can you do that while we're talking?
[00:15:11] Abby Jorgensen: Yeah, because it was usually 135s and one low 150s.
[00:15:17] Gerard Donnelly: Yeah, and he was in the high 150s, 160s, right from the first three minutes.
[00:15:24] Gerard Donnelly: And that's where you could say, look, I think, you know, the swim's taking more out of you.
[00:15:30] Gerard Donnelly: So, you know, that 75k, that was outdoor, and he pushed 247, normalised, 257.
[00:15:39] Gerard Donnelly: And his heart rate was 135.
[00:15:42] Gerard Donnelly: Yeah.
[00:15:42] Gerard Donnelly: And his max was 148.
[00:15:44] Gerard Donnelly: So here he is pushing 240s, 250s at the start of that ride, and his heart rate's 160.
[00:15:53] Gerard Donnelly: Let's have a quick look.
[00:15:56] Gerard Donnelly: So straight away, he's 150, you know –
[00:16:00] Gerard Donnelly: 156, right from the outset, 157, 156, you know, he's not in the 140s where he normally is.
[00:16:08] Gerard Donnelly: And if you grab that first section, you know, I would be, you that first 10 minutes, he's averaging 248.
[00:16:17] Gerard Donnelly: You know, when he did the 60-minuter, have a look at his 60-minuter, where he did 268 watts, 90% of that is 241.
[00:16:25] Gerard Donnelly: He's way over the range.
[00:16:28] Gerard Donnelly: It's just, it's bad.
[00:16:31] Gerard Donnelly: It's a shocking start.
[00:16:34] Gerard Donnelly: And there's a lot of downhill in there.
[00:16:36] Gerard Donnelly: You know what I mean?
[00:16:39] Gerard Donnelly: So, like, he's 243 for the first 11 minutes.
[00:16:43] Gerard Donnelly: And if you grab his downhill there, that's that section there, he's 252 going downhill at the start of his ride.
[00:16:52] Gerard Donnelly: So, I would be saying, this is a lot of your issue.
[00:16:57] Gerard Donnelly: The big way to do that is go to the peak.
[00:16:59] Gerard Donnelly: can saw-
[00:17:00] Gerard Donnelly: And you do this in the video, what was your best 10 seconds?
[00:17:04] Gerard Donnelly: 437, why the hell are you riding 437 watts in 90k?
[00:17:09] Gerard Donnelly: Why are riding 300 watts here at the start of your ride?
[00:17:13] Gerard Donnelly: That is just nuts when you're supposed to be riding between, really, 214 and 240 is his range.
[00:17:21] Gerard Donnelly: If we took that 60 minutes, 90% of 268 is 241 and 80% of 268 is 214.
[00:17:31] Gerard Donnelly: Even though in training he's done 247 for 75k and he's done 233 for 90k, that's 15 watts difference.
[00:17:41] Gerard Donnelly: There's something going on with this.
[00:17:43] Gerard Donnelly: But that was indoor.
[00:17:44] Gerard Donnelly: So, you know, that 90k was indoor, Abby.
[00:17:47] Gerard Donnelly: So, yeah, it's not that helpful, is it?
[00:17:50] Abby Jorgensen: No, because even those race ready where they're like 60 minutes at a time, he was in the two upper, like right around 240.
[00:18:01] Abby Jorgensen: And 237 to 240s in the, like, some of the other race-ready ones, too.
[00:18:06] Abby Jorgensen: So that's why, like, it didn't all make sense to.
[00:18:09] Abby Jorgensen: Yeah.
[00:18:10] Gerard Donnelly: Yeah.
[00:18:11] Gerard Donnelly: And those, those, that would be 4x30s, wouldn't they, in 3x40s?
[00:18:15] Gerard Donnelly: Yeah.
[00:18:15] Gerard Donnelly: And you get a rest, remember?
[00:18:17] Gerard Donnelly: That's why you can ride 240s, because he's getting a rest.
[00:18:21] Gerard Donnelly: But that 25th of October, that was indoor.
[00:18:24] Gerard Donnelly: That's hard to compare.
[00:18:25] Gerard Donnelly: But the outdoor, 247 for 75k, he's done that in real life, you know?
[00:18:32] Gerard Donnelly: So I understand what he's thinking.
[00:18:35] Gerard Donnelly: But, but if we took that, that 8th of November, the league city that's outdoor, okay, 268 for that 60 minutes, you've got to use that as your template.
[00:18:48] Gerard Donnelly: All right?
[00:18:49] Gerard Donnelly: So, so 90% of 268 is 241, and 80% of 268 is 214.
[00:18:58] Gerard Donnelly: So that's his range.
[00:18:59] Gerard Donnelly: And that, that's my.
[00:19:00] Gerard Donnelly: My fault for not talking to you about this before the race.
[00:19:06] Gerard Donnelly: So I think he's got his, you know, he started the ride way too hard.
[00:19:15] Gerard Donnelly: So, you know, go to the peak power and show him that, you know, showing that his first five minutes was 252, his best five minutes.
[00:19:24] Gerard Donnelly: You can see, you know, cadence is okay, but heart rate's already in the 150s.
[00:19:30] Gerard Donnelly: And when you've been able to do 75K at a heart rate of 135, that's, you know, that's way too high.
[00:19:40] Gerard Donnelly: Way too high a power number.
[00:19:42] Gerard Donnelly: He's 10 minutes, 250.
[00:19:44] Gerard Donnelly: First 10 minutes, 250, it's too much.
[00:19:46] Gerard Donnelly: And his heart rate should have told him that I'm riding too hard.
[00:19:50] Gerard Donnelly: When I'm supposed to be riding 135 to 145, and my heart rate's 153 already, I need to back off.
[00:20:00] Gerard Donnelly: You know, that's what I'd be telling him in this video, and in a nice way, not the way I'm yelling.
[00:20:07] Abby Jorgensen: Yeah, no, I mean, when we talked on whatever day it was before the race, I was like, we talked about heart rate, because I was like, if something goes wrong, look at your heart rate.
[00:20:17] Gerard Donnelly: So he should have known, but anxiety and stuff like that.
[00:20:22] Gerard Donnelly: Yeah, and the swim.
[00:20:23] Gerard Donnelly: Remember, the swims created fatigue.
[00:20:25] Gerard Donnelly: Yeah.
[00:20:26] Gerard Donnelly: And, you know, you can say to him, look, if we can in some training sessions, let's do some swims first, and then jump on the bike for your race-ready sessions.
[00:20:34] Gerard Donnelly: Let's have a practice at that.
[00:20:36] Gerard Donnelly: You know, it's okay to do that.
[00:20:39] Gerard Donnelly: If they've got the facility, you know, to do an open-water swim, has he got any open-water swim options where he lives?
[00:20:46] Abby Jorgensen: He does, but I'm not sure, like, where it's at.
[00:20:51] Abby Jorgensen: I'll have to ask him.
[00:20:52] Abby Jorgensen: Yeah, but he could always go to the pool.
[00:20:54] Gerard Donnelly: Yeah.
[00:20:54] Gerard Donnelly: And go and do a swim and then jump on the bike after doing a 2K swim set.
[00:21:01] Gerard Donnelly: All right.
[00:21:01] Gerard Donnelly: So for 10 minutes at 249, 20 minutes at 237, and, you that's really still 241.
[00:21:09] Gerard Donnelly: He's at the top of the range.
[00:21:11] Gerard Donnelly: And his heart rate, you know, it's not backing off.
[00:21:14] Gerard Donnelly: It's still in the 150s.
[00:21:16] Gerard Donnelly: So they're the things that I would be showing him.
[00:21:20] Gerard Donnelly: And then, you know, grabbing what he's doing at the end.
[00:21:23] Gerard Donnelly: You know, if he's riding 230s, 250s, he's doing 220 by the end.
[00:21:31] Gerard Donnelly: You know, that tells us that something's not right, doesn't it?
[00:21:35] Gerard Donnelly: And his heart rate's back to where it should be in training, isn't it?
[00:21:37] Gerard Donnelly: 144.
[00:21:40] Gerard Donnelly: So he's doing exactly the right ranges at the end.
[00:21:43] Gerard Donnelly: But I think that early start would have really increased the lactate, burnt some fueling, and, you know, look at the cadence, Abby, 77 at the end there.
[00:22:00] Gerard Donnelly: I just grabbed, so if grab this section here, let's just zoom in, and so have a look at, like, he's going up a hill here, and his cadence is at 79, he's got his cadence at, where is it here, 98, 97, really good cadence, let's just get rid of, let's get rid of some of this.
[00:22:30] Gerard Donnelly: So you can see, he's, you know, on the downhill, he's doing 89, 90, really happy with that, and as soon as he gets to see the rise here, his cadence is 79, what is it, why isn't he changing gears?
[00:22:44] Gerard Donnelly: You know, if, he's pushing, he's pushing 330, 340 watts, 330, you know, he's going uphill, and he's kept his cadence at 72.
[00:22:55] Gerard Donnelly: You know, you're already starting to climb, so, you know, he's pushing 200.
[00:23:00] Gerard Donnelly: 260s, 270s.
[00:23:01] Gerard Donnelly: He's just not reacting to the course, okay?
[00:23:06] Gerard Donnelly: This is what I'm saying, you know, this is still, this is at the start of the ride.
[00:23:12] Gerard Donnelly: So he's still riding way above the range as we want him to, 270s, 290s.
[00:23:16] Gerard Donnelly: He's going up the hill there at 290, 300.
[00:23:20] Gerard Donnelly: You know, his cadence is 84, which is actually okay.
[00:23:24] Gerard Donnelly: But go to a cadence of 90 and drop this power down to 240.
[00:23:30] Gerard Donnelly: Drop it by 50 watts.
[00:23:32] Gerard Donnelly: He's just not changing gears, Abby.
[00:23:34] Gerard Donnelly: And so he's scratching his head going, I don't understand.
[00:23:37] Gerard Donnelly: Most of his training's on the flat, isn't it?
[00:23:40] Gerard Donnelly: Yeah.
[00:23:40] Gerard Donnelly: So you say to him, Don, this is a great, Dan, this is a great learning experience for you.
[00:23:47] Gerard Donnelly: You're so used to riding all your stuff on the flat.
[00:23:51] Gerard Donnelly: If we start to ride indoors, we want you to not to load the TrainingPeaks session onto Ruby or Zwift.
[00:23:56] Gerard Donnelly: We want you to get the feeling of having to change gears on.
[00:23:59] Gerard Donnelly: Thank you.
[00:24:00] Gerard Donnelly: Free ride courses.
[00:24:01] Gerard Donnelly: Okay.
[00:24:02] Abby Jorgensen: Yeah.
[00:24:03] Abby Jorgensen: His next race is super flat.
[00:24:05] Abby Jorgensen: So.
[00:24:05] Abby Jorgensen: Yeah.
[00:24:06] Gerard Donnelly: So, but he needs to learn this though.
[00:24:08] Gerard Donnelly: Yeah.
[00:24:09] Gerard Donnelly: And he might say, well, it doesn't matter because my next race is flat.
[00:24:12] Gerard Donnelly: Well, that's just not true.
[00:24:14] Gerard Donnelly: If there's a headwind, you still have to adjust your cadence and your power.
[00:24:19] Gerard Donnelly: You know, headwind's just as bad as a hill.
[00:24:21] Gerard Donnelly: So I want to show him that 71, 68, 70, you're just not reacting.
[00:24:27] Gerard Donnelly: You know, that's, that's too long a period.
[00:24:29] Gerard Donnelly: Where you're not changing gears quickly enough.
[00:24:33] Gerard Donnelly: Um, and then, then he's still in the seventies and finally, finally he's back into, into the high eighties.
[00:24:39] Gerard Donnelly: Um, so change gears.
[00:24:41] Gerard Donnelly: So you don't have this spike in, in power all the time.
[00:24:44] Gerard Donnelly: You know, when you're trying to ride between 215 and 240, you just don't want to see, you know, bits where you're on 300, 333, 290.
[00:24:54] Gerard Donnelly: You know, I would be, the other thing I looked at was, and.
[00:24:59] Gerard Donnelly: Thank
[00:25:00] Gerard Donnelly: If you look at his overall ride, he's got, he's got, he's still got the five mile set, 8K.
[00:25:15] Abby Jorgensen: There's another file that has the two laps.
[00:25:18] Abby Jorgensen: Yes, okay.
[00:25:19] Gerard Donnelly: That must have been his watch and then the bike.
[00:25:23] Gerard Donnelly: So that was, I was horrified when I saw that.
[00:25:26] Gerard Donnelly: So if his watch is doing that, that's fine.
[00:25:30] Gerard Donnelly: So he split the two into halves.
[00:25:34] Gerard Donnelly: But, but I, I would be saying to him, if you feel like the hill goes for, I don't know, how long will the hill go for?
[00:25:41] Gerard Donnelly: If the hill goes for three minutes, just hit lap, you know, hit lap as many times as you want.
[00:25:47] Gerard Donnelly: Every time you come into a hill, just hit lap so that you stay in the range of 220 to 240, you know, and then you would know that you're riding 250.
[00:25:57] Gerard Donnelly: No voice.
[00:25:58] Gerard Donnelly: voice.
[00:26:02] Gerard Donnelly: You know, there's quite a few sections where there's some hills, and if they're really short, 30 seconds, don't worry about it, but if they're quite long, you know, 40 seconds, you know, he's still riding 260 for 40 seconds, you know what I mean?
[00:26:17] Gerard Donnelly: Every time we zoom into a hill, you know, there's a longer hill, which we could use, that's five minutes, and he's actually in the right range there, and cadence, so, and his heart rate's back where it should be.
[00:26:32] Gerard Donnelly: I think, I think he's just started out way too hot.
[00:26:37] Gerard Donnelly: Okay, yeah.
[00:26:39] Abby Jorgensen: What do you think?
[00:26:41] Abby Jorgensen: Yeah, I was, um, because when I was comparing heart rates, and then, like, his previous rides, I was kind of confused why he was in zone two.
[00:26:52] Gerard Donnelly: Yeah.
[00:26:52] Abby Jorgensen: I mean, the average was zone, you know, a little lower than we had talked about.
[00:26:58] Gerard Donnelly: So, I'd be just going.
[00:27:00] Gerard Donnelly: Every 20 minutes, as an example, I'd be saying, what was your power?
[00:27:06] Gerard Donnelly: 241, this is just for my own, 235, 232, and as you go through, he's now at 221, so he started at 241, so he's already dropped 20 watts.
[00:27:20] Gerard Donnelly: Now he's at 217, now he's at 211.
[00:27:26] Abby Jorgensen: I know the back half, if you look at the back half, he was going faster at the lower power, so there might have been a tailwind.
[00:27:33] Abby Jorgensen: Yes.
[00:27:34] Gerard Donnelly: But I noticed as well.
[00:27:36] Gerard Donnelly: But it's still, and there could be some drafting problems there as well.
[00:27:40] Gerard Donnelly: Yeah, I mean, I don't know.
[00:27:42] Gerard Donnelly: So I would be saying to him, you know, if you're going to average 240 at the start, I want you to keep averaging that.
[00:27:50] Gerard Donnelly: You know, you've made your bed, now you have to lay in it.
[00:27:56] Gerard Donnelly: So I would be really honing in.
[00:27:59] Gerard Donnelly: You, of course,
[00:28:00] Gerard Donnelly: Yourself a real disservice by starting so high.
[00:28:03] Gerard Donnelly: We never, you would never have told him to do that.
[00:28:06] Gerard Donnelly: There's no way you would have told him to do that.
[00:28:08] Gerard Donnelly: And so you've got to point it out really clearly that, you know, when you start at, you know, even if it took your first 15 minutes, if you're starting at 2.41, 2.45, what was your last 15 minutes?
[00:28:23] Gerard Donnelly: 2.14.
[00:28:24] Gerard Donnelly: It's literally 30 watts lower.
[00:28:27] Gerard Donnelly: Okay?
[00:28:28] Abby Jorgensen: Mm-hmm.
[00:28:28] Gerard Donnelly: That would be the things I would be really pointing out.
[00:28:33] Gerard Donnelly: And this has affected his run, even though I think overall it looks good here.
[00:28:41] Gerard Donnelly: It's actually, it looks quite good.
[00:28:43] Gerard Donnelly: Yeah.
[00:28:44] Gerard Donnelly: There's not a great deal of time, you know, above, there's only 12 minutes above 2.64, but there's a hell of a lot of time below 2.20, you know?
[00:28:54] Gerard Donnelly: Mm There's 50 minutes below 2.20.
[00:28:58] Gerard Donnelly: And you'd say...
[00:28:59] Gerard Donnelly: And say...
[00:28:59] Gerard Donnelly: And
[00:29:00] Gerard Donnelly: You'd say he's got it reasonably right here, but there's still, you know, I wouldn't be too critical of that because there's a lot of downhill.
[00:29:06] Gerard Donnelly: Yeah, that's what I kind of said.
[00:29:09] Gerard Donnelly: This is where I'd be more critical, Abby.
[00:29:11] Gerard Donnelly: I'd be saying 17 minutes, 29 minutes, 38 minutes, 42 minutes.
[00:29:18] Gerard Donnelly: You I can work that up to 50 minutes where he's actually riding below 210.
[00:29:26] Gerard Donnelly: 50 minutes he's riding below 210.
[00:29:28] Gerard Donnelly: That's a lot.
[00:29:29] Gerard Donnelly: And I'd be saying to him, you know, 240 is the upper range.
[00:29:34] Gerard Donnelly: You have 25 minutes, 35, 39, 41.
[00:29:39] Gerard Donnelly: So you've ridden a third in the right range, a third too low, and a third too high.
[00:29:43] Gerard Donnelly: That's how I would tell him.
[00:29:45] Gerard Donnelly: Pretty much you've ridden, you know, 33%.
[00:29:49] Gerard Donnelly: Well, it's just telling us 19, but I'd give him a little bit either side.
[00:29:53] Gerard Donnelly: You know, I'd say 33% of the time.
[00:29:55] Gerard Donnelly: So 19 and 15, 35.
[00:29:59] Gerard Donnelly: 35.
[00:29:59] Gerard Donnelly: 35.
[00:29:59] Gerard Donnelly: Thank
[00:30:00] Gerard Donnelly: And I wouldn't count that because that's above.
[00:30:02] Gerard Donnelly: So 35% is in the right range.
[00:30:04] Gerard Donnelly: And then 31 and 31, he's in the role.
[00:30:09] Gerard Donnelly: He's too high or too low.
[00:30:11] Gerard Donnelly: And that's hard because he's not used to that.
[00:30:14] Gerard Donnelly: And I looked at some of his flat circuit sessions.
[00:30:17] Gerard Donnelly: He nails it with the power.
[00:30:19] Gerard Donnelly: He rides beautifully.
[00:30:21] Gerard Donnelly: And I think the problem is he's not changing gears quick enough.
[00:30:24] Gerard Donnelly: And he's not used to it because he's never ridden hills.
[00:30:26] Gerard Donnelly: Okay, so I'd be really kind to him saying, again, this is your first time.
[00:30:31] Gerard Donnelly: And this has had a huge impact.
[00:30:33] Gerard Donnelly: And now you understand what we talk about, about riding so much time above 255 and above 240.
[00:30:40] Gerard Donnelly: You know, 25 and that's 50 minutes plus, you know, six is 56 minutes, nearly an hour above 240.
[00:30:49] Gerard Donnelly: And that's because you're not changing gears.
[00:30:51] Gerard Donnelly: That's because you're too slow at changing gears and reacting.
[00:30:54] Gerard Donnelly: And we get it.
[00:30:56] Gerard Donnelly: It's a good learning curve for you.
[00:30:57] Gerard Donnelly: But this has severely impacted your...
[00:31:00] Gerard Donnelly: You are a great runner, and you haven't been able to show it because of the way you rode, okay?
[00:31:05] Gerard Donnelly: Okay.
[00:31:09] Gerard Donnelly: Your Loom video has got a lot of good things, but I would call him and talk about that.
[00:31:14] Gerard Donnelly: Okay.
[00:31:15] Gerard Donnelly: Yeah.
[00:31:15] Abby Jorgensen: I've already, like, yeah, we're sending up a call later this week because he's, you know how he is.
[00:31:20] Abby Jorgensen: He's very competitive, and he's like, my friend beat me, but I was like, it comes down to the swim.
[00:31:25] Abby Jorgensen: I mean, he beat his friend on the bike and the run, but I was like, I mean, the swim, but, yeah, there's so much.
[00:31:31] Abby Jorgensen: I told him, I'm this is your race.
[00:31:33] Abby Jorgensen: This is why we do this.
[00:31:35] Abby Jorgensen: Yeah.
[00:31:36] Abby Jorgensen: Yeah.
[00:31:36] Gerard Donnelly: So he's got to improve this, changing gears, stop starting so high.
[00:31:41] Gerard Donnelly: He should be looking at those numbers, and we don't want him to start there, you know, regardless of what he's done in training.
[00:31:49] Gerard Donnelly: I don't want him to start at 250s, 240s.
[00:31:52] Gerard Donnelly: You know, I want him to start at 220s, 230s.
[00:31:55] Gerard Donnelly: It's a 90K.
[00:31:56] Gerard Donnelly: How many 90Ks has he done?
[00:31:57] Gerard Donnelly: How many half-armands has he done?
[00:31:59] Gerard Donnelly: No.
[00:32:00] Gerard Donnelly: No.
[00:32:01] Abby Jorgensen: So, you know, what are you doing?
[00:32:06] Gerard Donnelly: And it's a different course than you've trained on.
[00:32:08] Gerard Donnelly: So I just think he needs to really think about his gear changing and maybe during the winter, get him on the indoor trainer and get him on courses where he's riding as a free ride and get him to try to ride the ranges there with changing gears.
[00:32:26] Abby Jorgensen: Yeah, he's getting a new bike too, so.
[00:32:30] Abby Jorgensen: Oh, is he getting a road bike or TT bike?
[00:32:32] Gerard Donnelly: TT bike.
[00:32:33] Abby Jorgensen: Yeah, great.
[00:32:33] Abby Jorgensen: What was he riding there, a road bike?
[00:32:35] Abby Jorgensen: Oh, yeah, I think it's an older, like, I think it's an older TT bike.
[00:32:40] Abby Jorgensen: Yeah.
[00:32:40] Abby Jorgensen: Because, like, he's always said that it doesn't, like, he's had it fit, but he's just, it doesn't technically, it's too small for him.
[00:32:49] Abby Jorgensen: So, hopefully this new bike will fit him better.
[00:32:52] Abby Jorgensen: And I don't if the gearing was on the, on the arrow bars or not, because sometimes that, that, that makes you.
[00:33:00] Gerard Donnelly: It's doesn't it, if you have to keep doing this.
[00:33:01] Gerard Donnelly: Yeah, it's hard.
[00:33:03] Gerard Donnelly: Yeah, I totally agree.
[00:33:05] Gerard Donnelly: And you could tell him in the olden days, Abby, on our road bikes, our gear shifters were down on the up tube.
[00:33:11] Gerard Donnelly: I don't know if you ever knew that.
[00:33:14] Gerard Donnelly: You had to literally take your hand off.
[00:33:16] Gerard Donnelly: You know how we just quickly do this all the time.
[00:33:18] Gerard Donnelly: We're just quickly filtering.
[00:33:19] Gerard Donnelly: But you had to take your hand off the handlebars and lever the trails.
[00:33:26] Abby Jorgensen: Yeah, I was confused on, too, because, yeah, all of his rides previously, like, everything seemed, the high power range and his heart rate.
[00:33:35] Abby Jorgensen: So I was really kind of confused.
[00:33:37] Gerard Donnelly: Yeah.
[00:33:38] Gerard Donnelly: So tell him, you know, you've ridden so hard that your heart rate's way above where it should be.
[00:33:44] Gerard Donnelly: Okay.
[00:33:44] Gerard Donnelly: And it's caused you all sorts of trouble for the rest of the day, not only the rest of the ride.
[00:33:51] Gerard Donnelly: You've ridden 30 watts lower at the start, at the finish than you did at the start.
[00:33:55] Gerard Donnelly: And that's, I would be asking him, tell me exactly what you had on your
[00:34:00] Gerard Donnelly: Nutrition for the day.
[00:34:01] Gerard Donnelly: I'm thinking he hasn't had enough nutrition.
[00:34:05] Gerard Donnelly: And I would be digging into what do you tell me exactly what you consumed?
[00:34:09] Gerard Donnelly: How many gels?
[00:34:10] Gerard Donnelly: What were they?
[00:34:10] Gerard Donnelly: How many carbs are in those gels?
[00:34:12] Gerard Donnelly: Have you had them before?
[00:34:14] Gerard Donnelly: You know, I would be digging into that.
[00:34:17] Gerard Donnelly: And, you know, he had a gut issue in the run.
[00:34:20] Gerard Donnelly: His comments was that he felt, you know, uncomfortable.
[00:34:23] Gerard Donnelly: Yeah, he felt uncomfortable.
[00:34:25] Abby Jorgensen: He said gassy.
[00:34:26] Abby Jorgensen: And then he said, because we went over his fueling plan in our race call.
[00:34:31] Abby Jorgensen: And it sounded, it sounded good.
[00:34:33] Abby Jorgensen: And then he said it was hard.
[00:34:35] Abby Jorgensen: He told me it was hard to drink his, his fluid after the swim because things just felt off.
[00:34:44] Abby Jorgensen: So I don't know exactly what that means.
[00:34:46] Abby Jorgensen: Maybe the anxiety of the swim.
[00:34:48] Gerard Donnelly: Yeah, and he could have been consuming some salt water.
[00:34:50] Gerard Donnelly: So he had a gut aid from that, maybe.
[00:34:52] Gerard Donnelly: So talk about that.
[00:34:54] Gerard Donnelly: But we need to learn from what he consumed.
[00:34:57] Gerard Donnelly: Abby, this run, 148.
[00:35:00] Gerard Donnelly: I had him down for a 132 to 136.
[00:35:02] Gerard Donnelly: That is so far off.
[00:35:05] Gerard Donnelly: Is that what you had him down for?
[00:35:07] Gerard Donnelly: Yeah, I had, let's see.
[00:35:09] Abby Jorgensen: Yeah, because we had him starting.
[00:35:10] Abby Jorgensen: Yeah, I had 132 to 136, like a 701 to 720 average pace.
[00:35:17] Gerard Donnelly: Yeah, and I think when you said he started too hard, that's true, but that wasn't the reason.
[00:35:22] Gerard Donnelly: Yeah, now that we look at the bike and everything.
[00:35:24] Gerard Donnelly: Yes, yeah.
[00:35:25] Gerard Donnelly: I think it is too hard to start there.
[00:35:28] Gerard Donnelly: He should have done the same.
[00:35:29] Gerard Donnelly: He's done the same in the run as he did, especially when he's feeling worse.
[00:35:33] Gerard Donnelly: Why would you start there, you know?
[00:35:35] Gerard Donnelly: You know, if you're feeling bad off the bike, be more conservative.
[00:35:40] Gerard Donnelly: Anyway, start at 750 pace, start at 8, because he ended up running a 9-minute K pace, mile pace.
[00:35:49] Gerard Donnelly: So I would be saying to him, Dan, you are an unbelievably good runner.
[00:35:53] Gerard Donnelly: You haven't been able to show it here because of what happened on the bike and the swim.
[00:35:58] Gerard Donnelly: And there's a lot for us.
[00:36:00] Gerard Donnelly: What's to learn here?
[00:36:00] Gerard Donnelly: And we can't just move on.
[00:36:02] Gerard Donnelly: We've got to really identify this.
[00:36:06] Gerard Donnelly: And, you know, you should be disappointed.
[00:36:10] Gerard Donnelly: This is a disappointing run.
[00:36:12] Gerard Donnelly: He's literally 14 minutes minimum slower than he should have been.
[00:36:19] Gerard Donnelly: But that's the lesson of the race, isn't it?
[00:36:21] Gerard Donnelly: But, you know, so what was his comments?
[00:36:26] Gerard Donnelly: Very disappointed.
[00:36:27] Gerard Donnelly: didn't expect to blow up like this.
[00:36:28] Gerard Donnelly: I was really counting on my run to carry me through, which is true.
[00:36:32] Gerard Donnelly: Stomach problems.
[00:36:33] Gerard Donnelly: Took a goo at three miles and didn't feel good.
[00:36:36] Gerard Donnelly: Started grabbing water and scratch.
[00:36:38] Gerard Donnelly: I don't think scratch has carbs.
[00:36:40] Gerard Donnelly: Has he had scratch before in training?
[00:36:43] Gerard Donnelly: I don't think he said he had.
[00:36:45] Abby Jorgensen: He usually uses tailwind.
[00:36:47] Gerard Donnelly: Why did he run out of nutrition that he had to grab some more?
[00:36:52] Gerard Donnelly: If he's got bad gut, he should grab a Coke.
[00:36:55] Gerard Donnelly: That would be better.
[00:36:58] Gerard Donnelly: His energy levels are down.
[00:37:00] Gerard Donnelly: I think that means he's actually bonking a bit, not enough nutrition on the bike because of his sickly feeling, and he finished off strong, and, you know, that's fantastic.
[00:37:11] Gerard Donnelly: But I think there's so much that he should understand that he can run way better than that, and he's in the form of doing that.
[00:37:24] Gerard Donnelly: You can't just run – what did he run?
[00:37:27] Gerard Donnelly: He ran 1.34 literally a month ago.
[00:37:30] Gerard Donnelly: He ran 41.30 off the bike for 10K, you know, 10 days ago.
[00:37:36] Gerard Donnelly: You know, that tells us that at worst he should have ran a 1.40, at worst.
[00:37:44] Gerard Donnelly: So tell him his form is good, he just didn't get to show it because of what happened, okay?
[00:37:52] Gerard Donnelly: And don't be disheartened by this, Dan.
[00:37:54] Gerard Donnelly: This is all learning, and it shows you how horrible you can run even though you've got great –
[00:38:00] Gerard Donnelly: Um, if all these things are, uh, working against you.
[00:38:04] Gerard Donnelly: Okay.
[00:38:06] Gerard Donnelly: Okay.
[00:38:08] Gerard Donnelly: You all right with that?
[00:38:10] Gerard Donnelly: Yeah, no, that helps.
[00:38:11] Abby Jorgensen: Sometimes I don't always know exactly what to say in their race.
[00:38:15] Abby Jorgensen: Yeah.
[00:38:15] Abby Jorgensen: Just yell out to me.
[00:38:17] Gerard Donnelly: I'm so happy to help you with these before you send them if you want, because now that you know that you probably do a completely different.
[00:38:24] Gerard Donnelly: Yeah.
[00:38:25] Abby Jorgensen: But I think too, like it eases them and I can have another call and be like diving further.
[00:38:30] Abby Jorgensen: Yeah.
[00:38:30] Abby Jorgensen: think he'll be appreciative of it because he's really open to feedback.
[00:38:35] Abby Jorgensen: And he's a detail man.
[00:38:36] Gerard Donnelly: So he loves you digging into the detail.
[00:38:39] Gerard Donnelly: Oh, he does.
[00:38:39] Abby Jorgensen: Like, I don't know why, but the other day he asked me what my address was.
[00:38:42] Abby Jorgensen: So I don't know what that means.
[00:38:45] Gerard Donnelly: I would say he's going to send you a thank you.
[00:38:47] Gerard Donnelly: He's going to send me something.
[00:38:48] Abby Jorgensen: But, uh, yeah, he's a, he's very appreciative and I love working with him because he does anything.
[00:38:55] Abby Jorgensen: Yeah.
[00:38:55] Abby Jorgensen: We asked, assuming his family lets him, but.
[00:39:00] Gerard Donnelly: Yeah, no, that's great.
[00:39:02] Gerard Donnelly: I've had a few correspondents with Coco, and she wants to set up a meeting with us to discuss her 2026.
[00:39:11] Gerard Donnelly: Yeah.
[00:39:12] Gerard Donnelly: So it's really just a matter of you and I and her coming up with a day and a time that's suitable to everybody.
[00:39:18] Gerard Donnelly: That could be tricky.
[00:39:20] Gerard Donnelly: That will be really tricky.
[00:39:24] Abby Jorgensen: I've had some conversations with her too, so if it doesn't, yeah, I don't know, whatever works.
[00:39:29] Abby Jorgensen: I want you to be the main driver.
[00:39:32] Gerard Donnelly: I just want to be the advisor.
[00:39:35] Gerard Donnelly: She's your athlete, and I want you to be the one, you know, if you and I can talk beforehand about what we think are the right things, and then you drive the conversation with me, just contributing.
[00:39:50] Gerard Donnelly: So I just want to quickly, I actually got a message while we've just been talking from Dan, just to give you some...
[00:39:59] Gerard Donnelly: ...
[00:39:59] Gerard Donnelly: ...
[00:39:59] Gerard Donnelly: ...
[00:40:00] Gerard Donnelly: And I've been coaching him.
[00:40:02] Gerard Donnelly: I told you about him, didn't I?
[00:40:04] Gerard Donnelly: Oh, is he the one long guy?
[00:40:06] Gerard Donnelly: Yeah, one long guy.
[00:40:09] Gerard Donnelly: I got your message.
[00:40:10] Gerard Donnelly: I appreciate the follow-up.
[00:40:12] Gerard Donnelly: Thank you.
[00:40:13] Gerard Donnelly: And I've just needed a couple of days to kind of think about things and evaluate, you know, how I want to move forward.
[00:40:18] Gerard Donnelly: I think I'm going to look for a coach in my area here close by.
[00:40:24] Gerard Donnelly: You know, one of the things that was great about your podcast is I got to know you for about two years.
[00:40:31] Gerard Donnelly: Yeah, okay.
[00:40:32] Gerard Donnelly: Sounds like he's moving on.
[00:40:36] Gerard Donnelly: I said to him that when someone leaves the program, I don't bring them back on.
[00:40:45] Gerard Donnelly: They have to go to one of our other coaches.
[00:40:47] Gerard Donnelly: And I explained, wouldn't matter who you got as a coach, they're all going to coach you the same way.
[00:40:52] Gerard Donnelly: But he's saying that that's not what he wants.
[00:40:55] Gerard Donnelly: He wants me.
[00:40:56] Gerard Donnelly: So that's bad luck.
[00:41:00] Gerard Donnelly: Um, so let's move on from him.
[00:41:04] Gerard Donnelly: Um, I wanted to quickly talk about, uh, did you have a good end conversation with Peter?
[00:41:11] Abby Jorgensen: Yeah, he's looking at, uh, I mean, his goal obviously is Nice.
[00:41:16] Abby Jorgensen: And then he also is talking about maybe trying to do a full Ironman next year as well.
[00:41:22] Abby Jorgensen: So he's still in Spain right now.
[00:41:24] Abby Jorgensen: So I'm just kind of letting him enjoy.
[00:41:26] Abby Jorgensen: Lucky you.
[00:41:27] Gerard Donnelly: Yeah.
[00:41:28] Abby Jorgensen: He stayed till the 19th.
[00:41:30] Abby Jorgensen: So a couple more days left, but, um, Okay.
[00:41:37] Abby Jorgensen: So we were trying to find, he wanted, I'm trying to think which one he said, Texas, which is April because it has the most slots.
[00:41:44] Abby Jorgensen: Yeah.
[00:41:44] Abby Jorgensen: And he wanted to know if that was enough time and then to get ready for it.
[00:41:49] Abby Jorgensen: And then enough time between that and Nice.
[00:41:53] Gerard Donnelly: Yep.
[00:41:56] Gerard Donnelly: So, I mean, I don't mean April.
[00:41:58] Abby Jorgensen: mean, he, he has the base for it, obviously.
[00:42:00] Abby Jorgensen: Obviously.
[00:42:02] Gerard Donnelly: Yeah.
[00:42:02] Gerard Donnelly: Depends on how much time he's got available to train.
[00:42:06] Gerard Donnelly: That's the answer.
[00:42:06] Gerard Donnelly: That's the question.
[00:42:08] Abby Jorgensen: I think now that once he gets back, we'll try it.
[00:42:11] Abby Jorgensen: I'll hash that out with them.
[00:42:12] Abby Jorgensen: Cause I think now that he, you know, doesn't have a relationship and just has his daughter back and forth between his ex.
[00:42:18] Abby Jorgensen: I think he has more time.
[00:42:20] Abby Jorgensen: Yeah.
[00:42:20] Abby Jorgensen: He did a better job of training once he moved of like just being more consistent.
[00:42:25] Abby Jorgensen: Yeah.
[00:42:26] Gerard Donnelly: So he did.
[00:42:28] Gerard Donnelly: He did a great job.
[00:42:30] Gerard Donnelly: Okay.
[00:42:31] Gerard Donnelly: Uh, we can have more discussions about him, about what races.
[00:42:35] Gerard Donnelly: Um, yeah.
[00:42:36] Gerard Donnelly: Uh, do he, he doing good.
[00:42:44] Abby Jorgensen: We're just trying to find that balance for him.
[00:42:47] Abby Jorgensen: Um, what's he got coming up?
[00:42:52] Gerard Donnelly: Anything?
[00:42:52] Abby Jorgensen: no, he has races next, uh, next spring and summer.
[00:42:56] Abby Jorgensen: So it's there in their winter time.
[00:42:58] Abby Jorgensen: So I told him that.
[00:43:00] Abby Jorgensen: The biggest thing right now, I'll just be building back up that FTP, because he'll just be doing some sprints his distance, so, and then he still wants to do some high rock stuff as well.
[00:43:13] Gerard Donnelly: Yep, okay.
[00:43:14] Gerard Donnelly: So, trying to find a balance for him.
[00:43:16] Gerard Donnelly: Good.
[00:43:18] Gerard Donnelly: Has Coco got any events that she's looking at during the winter?
[00:43:23] Gerard Donnelly: she?
[00:43:26] Abby Jorgensen: She's going to Grenoble, isn't she?
[00:43:28] Gerard Donnelly: Grenoble.
[00:43:30] Abby Jorgensen: She's going to, yeah, we're, so, what's it say?
[00:43:36] Abby Jorgensen: I think she's there until the end of January.
[00:43:38] Gerard Donnelly: Yes, so, we really need to, I need to help you adjust that.
[00:43:42] Abby Jorgensen: Yeah, I just put it in, and then I was like, figure it out.
[00:43:48] Abby Jorgensen: Yep.
[00:43:49] Abby Jorgensen: I wanted to get her tested before she leaves, though.
[00:43:51] Abby Jorgensen: Is that the right thing?
[00:43:53] Gerard Donnelly: That is the right thing, yep.
[00:43:55] Gerard Donnelly: Yep.
[00:43:57] Gerard Donnelly: I kind of, I kind of got, I didn't like, I
[00:44:00] Abby Jorgensen: I like, if you look at her Sunday, she did like almost a seven hour ride.
[00:44:03] Abby Jorgensen: And I'm like, what are you doing?
[00:44:04] Abby Jorgensen: She's like, I just wanted to do whatever I wanted to do.
[00:44:07] Abby Jorgensen: And I was like, OK, I was like, that's not going to help your recovery.
[00:44:12] Abby Jorgensen: So she promised to stay on track this week.
[00:44:16] Abby Jorgensen: So the weather wouldn't have been that good.
[00:44:20] Abby Jorgensen: So I don't know what it ended up being for temperature wise.
[00:44:24] Abby Jorgensen: I don't know all over like we are, too, but.
[00:44:29] Abby Jorgensen: Where is she?
[00:44:30] Gerard Donnelly: Is she back home?
[00:44:31] Gerard Donnelly: Yeah, she's back home.
[00:44:34] Gerard Donnelly: All right.
[00:44:38] Gerard Donnelly: Andrew?
[00:44:39] Abby Jorgensen: He just started back up with a little bit of structure this week.
[00:44:43] Abby Jorgensen: Yep.
[00:44:44] Abby Jorgensen: So he wanted to do a start with four workouts a week and then kind of ease back in once January hits.
[00:44:52] Abby Jorgensen: So.
[00:44:54] Gerard Donnelly: So what's his next goal?
[00:44:58] Gerard Donnelly: Um, he's.
[00:44:59] Abby Jorgensen: So,
[00:45:00] Abby Jorgensen: He's trying to decide on a summer race.
[00:45:03] Abby Jorgensen: He can't decide which one he wants yet.
[00:45:05] Abby Jorgensen: He's thinking Muncie because it's right at home.
[00:45:09] Gerard Donnelly: Or there is another one.
[00:45:11] Abby Jorgensen: He wants to possibly do Michigan in September.
[00:45:13] Abby Jorgensen: That's a 70.3.
[00:45:15] Abby Jorgensen: Yep, okay.
[00:45:16] Abby Jorgensen: So there's a couple ones on his list.
[00:45:19] Abby Jorgensen: He doesn't have to.
[00:45:19] Abby Jorgensen: He was supposed to have an ablation to his heart, but that got canceled because everything looks good now.
[00:45:26] Abby Jorgensen: So we don't have to do that.
[00:45:28] Abby Jorgensen: Yep.
[00:45:30] Gerard Donnelly: Do your best if he's, you know, encourage him during this period.
[00:45:34] Gerard Donnelly: This is his chance to catch up on some great fitness.
[00:45:37] Gerard Donnelly: And if he restricts himself to four sessions, he's probably going to waste this period, Abby.
[00:45:45] Gerard Donnelly: Okay.
[00:45:46] Gerard Donnelly: I would be, if he's only going to have four sessions, I wouldn't be letting him swim at all, I'm just saying.
[00:45:52] Gerard Donnelly: Yeah.
[00:45:54] Gerard Donnelly: You know, you need to do at least two rides and two runs a week, a minimum.
[00:45:59] Gerard Donnelly: Okay.
[00:46:01] Gerard Donnelly: He's going to go so far backwards.
[00:46:03] Abby Jorgensen: Yeah, I think it was more of just needing a break and his wife wanted him home more and stuff like that.
[00:46:09] Abby Jorgensen: But don't let this go on all of December.
[00:46:12] Gerard Donnelly: That's more important.
[00:46:13] Gerard Donnelly: Yeah.
[00:46:14] Gerard Donnelly: Give him, you know, but you've got to give them the reason.
[00:46:20] Gerard Donnelly: The reason is, you know, I've got you to a really good fitness level.
[00:46:22] Gerard Donnelly: If you do this to yourself, you go backwards 50%.
[00:46:27] Gerard Donnelly: You're going to spend another two months catching back up again to where you were.
[00:46:32] Gerard Donnelly: So, yeah, that's my message.
[00:46:36] Gerard Donnelly: What's Sin like to work with?
[00:46:38] Gerard Donnelly: He's good.
[00:46:39] Abby Jorgensen: Yeah, no, he's really good to work with.
[00:46:41] Abby Jorgensen: Yeah.
[00:46:42] Gerard Donnelly: You happy with his equipment?
[00:46:47] Gerard Donnelly: Right.
[00:46:48] Abby Jorgensen: I mean, it's a lot lower than he expected because he did that ramp test, but I told him that's normal.
[00:46:54] Abby Jorgensen: Yeah.
[00:46:55] Abby Jorgensen: But execution wise.
[00:47:00] Abby Jorgensen: Yeah, he's a bit ragged, isn't he?
[00:47:02] Abby Jorgensen: Yeah, he told me, he's like, I've to get used to shifting because he's so used to using erg mode.
[00:47:07] Gerard Donnelly: Yeah, yeah.
[00:47:09] Gerard Donnelly: And remind him that he has to stay in the TT position.
[00:47:13] Gerard Donnelly: I would say that's not him.
[00:47:14] Gerard Donnelly: I'd say that's him standing up.
[00:47:17] Gerard Donnelly: But, yeah.
[00:47:18] Gerard Donnelly: And his cadence is probably a bit high, Abby.
[00:47:22] Gerard Donnelly: Okay.
[00:47:23] Gerard Donnelly: Tell him not to spin so much, I reckon.
[00:47:26] Gerard Donnelly: Anything from 85 to 95 is good.
[00:47:30] Gerard Donnelly: This is really, this is really too much.
[00:47:34] Gerard Donnelly: Like, his last five minutes, he's over 100.
[00:47:37] Gerard Donnelly: Okay?
[00:47:38] Gerard Donnelly: Okay.
[00:47:39] Gerard Donnelly: His last two minutes, he's probably, it doesn't look like he's changing gears much to me.
[00:47:44] Gerard Donnelly: Yeah, it didn't look like it too much towards the end of the whole time.
[00:47:49] Gerard Donnelly: Yeah.
[00:47:53] Gerard Donnelly: Yeah, like, we don't want him riding 105.
[00:47:55] Gerard Donnelly: All right.
[00:47:56] Gerard Donnelly: Thank you.
[00:47:57] Gerard Donnelly: You
[00:48:00] Gerard Donnelly: 107.
[00:48:01] Gerard Donnelly: my goodness.
[00:48:02] Gerard Donnelly: Okay.
[00:48:04] Gerard Donnelly: How are you going with 10k?
[00:48:06] Gerard Donnelly: It was good.
[00:48:08] Gerard Donnelly: Yeah.
[00:48:09] Gerard Donnelly: No, that one.
[00:48:10] Gerard Donnelly: No, this one.
[00:48:12] Gerard Donnelly: 46, was it?
[00:48:13] Gerard Donnelly: Right.
[00:48:13] Gerard Donnelly: Okay.
[00:48:14] Gerard Donnelly: The same as mine.
[00:48:17] Abby Jorgensen: He executed better than me.
[00:48:19] Gerard Donnelly: Did he do exactly what the plan was for the second?
[00:48:24] Abby Jorgensen: No, it was a little bit.
[00:48:27] Gerard Donnelly: 43.
[00:48:32] Gerard Donnelly: So best 5k at the end.
[00:48:33] Gerard Donnelly: All right.
[00:48:33] Gerard Donnelly: That's good.
[00:48:36] Gerard Donnelly: So maybe he's manually done that, has he?
[00:48:43] Abby Jorgensen: Yeah, he might have.
[00:48:46] Gerard Donnelly: That's ridiculous, but it is.
[00:48:49] Gerard Donnelly: Good.
[00:48:51] Gerard Donnelly: What's he like as a swimmer?
[00:48:53] Gerard Donnelly: He's decent.
[00:48:56] Abby Jorgensen: Right around that two-minute mark, I believe?
[00:48:59] Abby Jorgensen: Or wait, it was.
[00:49:00] Abby Jorgensen: It's 154 for the meters.
[00:49:02] Gerard Donnelly: That's great.
[00:49:03] Gerard Donnelly: Yep.
[00:49:04] Gerard Donnelly: Yep.
[00:49:05] Gerard Donnelly: So good.
[00:49:06] Gerard Donnelly: You've got him.
[00:49:07] Gerard Donnelly: Got him.
[00:49:09] Gerard Donnelly: He's not injured at all, is he?
[00:49:11] Gerard Donnelly: He's fine to do.
[00:49:12] Gerard Donnelly: Yeah, he's good.
[00:49:13] Gerard Donnelly: Yep.
[00:49:16] Gerard Donnelly: He's already been running quite a bit, so volume-wise, he should be.
[00:49:20] Gerard Donnelly: Yep.
[00:49:23] Gerard Donnelly: And he's got the time.
[00:49:25] Gerard Donnelly: Just remind me, has he got time to train?
[00:49:28] Gerard Donnelly: Yeah.
[00:49:30] Abby Jorgensen: Yeah, when I talked to him, he said he could do it, like, morning and at night he could run, or vice versa.
[00:49:36] Abby Jorgensen: Yep.
[00:49:38] Abby Jorgensen: Things like that, so.
[00:49:39] Gerard Donnelly: Yep.
[00:49:40] Gerard Donnelly: So May is his first race?
[00:49:42] Gerard Donnelly: Yes.
[00:49:42] Gerard Donnelly: Can we put it in?
[00:49:43] Gerard Donnelly: Yep, okay.
[00:49:44] Abby Jorgensen: And then his goal, he thinks, is, like, I think he said, like, an October Ironman, maybe.
[00:49:50] Abby Jorgensen: He hasn't, like, he hadn't decided yet.
[00:49:53] Abby Jorgensen: Yep, okay.
[00:49:55] Gerard Donnelly: So, yeah, try, try your best each week.
[00:49:59] Gerard Donnelly: Check.
[00:50:00] Gerard Donnelly: Add some more time into the run.
[00:50:01] Gerard Donnelly: And if you think that he's struggling to fit it in, just get rid of the cool down in the bike set.
[00:50:10] Gerard Donnelly: And same in this, get rid of the cool down so that we can make these 50 minutes and then move up to 60 and then keep increasing the run off the bike here.
[00:50:22] Gerard Donnelly: How soon with him do you think I should add like the steady state and stuff like that?
[00:50:26] Gerard Donnelly: Yeah, if you feel like he's been running a lot, the things I would do is go back and see how many Ks has he been running.
[00:50:35] Gerard Donnelly: So that's before he joined us.
[00:50:38] Gerard Donnelly: 26, sorry, 40, 38, 43, 22.
[00:50:46] Gerard Donnelly: So he had three weeks of 40s.
[00:50:50] Gerard Donnelly: And then not much, not much.
[00:50:53] Gerard Donnelly: 22, nothing.
[00:50:56] Gerard Donnelly: Unless, unless he just hasn't loaded anything.
[00:50:59] Gerard Donnelly: Yeah.
[00:51:00] Abby Jorgensen: It could been before he did TrainingPeaks.
[00:51:02] Abby Jorgensen: Yeah.
[00:51:02] Gerard Donnelly: So I think you could...
[00:51:06] Gerard Donnelly: Maybe get through this block and then the next block.
[00:51:09] Gerard Donnelly: Exactly right.
[00:51:09] Gerard Donnelly: Do the block.
[00:51:10] Gerard Donnelly: And tell him, you know, we just want you to get used to running four times a week with this program before we start giving you...
[00:51:18] Gerard Donnelly: Intensive.
[00:51:20] Gerard Donnelly: Yeah.
[00:51:22] Gerard Donnelly: Okay.
[00:51:23] Gerard Donnelly: Yep.
[00:51:25] Gerard Donnelly: James?
[00:51:28] Abby Jorgensen: He's going to the physio tomorrow.
[00:51:31] Abby Jorgensen: His hip's been bothering him since his 70.3.
[00:51:34] Abby Jorgensen: He never traveled last week, but his physio told him not to do anything but swim until he sees him.
[00:51:43] Abby Jorgensen: So...
[00:51:43] Abby Jorgensen: Yeah.
[00:51:44] Gerard Donnelly: Yep.
[00:51:46] Abby Jorgensen: So, yeah.
[00:51:48] Abby Jorgensen: Just kind of wait.
[00:51:49] Abby Jorgensen: Yep.
[00:51:50] Gerard Donnelly: Okay.
[00:51:50] Gerard Donnelly: And you're seeing physio Tuesday, is it?
[00:51:53] Gerard Donnelly: Yeah.
[00:51:53] Gerard Donnelly: Okay.
[00:51:55] Gerard Donnelly: Okay.
[00:51:55] Gerard Donnelly: All right.
[00:51:56] Gerard Donnelly: Good.
[00:51:58] Gerard Donnelly: We don't have Cindy, we?
[00:52:00] Abby Jorgensen: You know, we're just gonna try to get her through the 70.3.
[00:52:08] Abby Jorgensen: She's traveling to like, I don't know where, somewhere in the Europe, like, till like right before the 70.3.
[00:52:16] Abby Jorgensen: So of course, she doesn't have like a bike.
[00:52:18] Abby Jorgensen: So I was like, all right, well.
[00:52:23] Abby Jorgensen: Yeah, I'm just crazy chick.
[00:52:26] Abby Jorgensen: Like, yeah, and she just kept like, I programmed stuff, and she just do like an hour and a half, two hours more than like I programmed.
[00:52:33] Abby Jorgensen: And I'm like, whatever.
[00:52:35] Abby Jorgensen: I mean, I guess at this point, I'm just trying to get you to the start and finish line.
[00:52:39] Abby Jorgensen: So yeah.
[00:52:43] Abby Jorgensen: And she can't get her power connected to her bike.
[00:52:46] Abby Jorgensen: So at this point, I'm just like, she's ridden.
[00:52:50] Gerard Donnelly: She's gone to the one though.
[00:52:52] Gerard Donnelly: So she's ridden on the velodrome for four hours.
[00:52:55] Abby Jorgensen: Yeah, I don't, she must not have anything to do.
[00:52:59] Abby Jorgensen: Oh my God.
[00:53:00] Gerard Donnelly: God, that's absolutely ridiculous.
[00:53:06] Gerard Donnelly: I can't even imagine doing that.
[00:53:10] Gerard Donnelly: Oh, my God.
[00:53:12] Gerard Donnelly: Please don't say she's done five hours at the velodrome.
[00:53:15] Gerard Donnelly: I don't think so.
[00:53:20] Gerard Donnelly: Yep, she has.
[00:53:22] Gerard Donnelly: That's at the velodrome?
[00:53:24] Gerard Donnelly: Yep.
[00:53:25] Gerard Donnelly: Bloody hell.
[00:53:27] Gerard Donnelly: She's ridden two and ridden home.
[00:53:35] Gerard Donnelly: Four hours.
[00:53:36] Gerard Donnelly: 100K on the velodrome.
[00:53:40] Gerard Donnelly: That velodrome is literally the smallest velodrome that we have in Melbourne.
[00:53:45] Gerard Donnelly: How big are they supposed to be?
[00:53:48] Gerard Donnelly: Well, they're meant to be 250 metres.
[00:53:50] Gerard Donnelly: This one's only 100 and something metres.
[00:53:52] Gerard Donnelly: it would literally take her 20 seconds to do one lap.
[00:53:57] Gerard Donnelly: What's that?
[00:53:58] Gerard Donnelly: idea.
[00:53:58] Gerard Donnelly: a idea.
[00:53:58] Gerard Donnelly: now, go.
[00:53:58] Gerard Donnelly: know, we it, That's Thank
[00:54:01] Gerard Donnelly: That's stupid.
[00:54:03] Gerard Donnelly: Anyway, what can we say about that?
[00:54:05] Gerard Donnelly: I mean, I've tried everything.
[00:54:08] Abby Jorgensen: I've never seen anything like it in my life.
[00:54:10] Gerard Donnelly: That's ridiculous.
[00:54:11] Gerard Donnelly: She's running three hours for 20K.
[00:54:13] Gerard Donnelly: She's walking half of it.
[00:54:17] Abby Jorgensen: Yeah.
[00:54:18] Abby Jorgensen: I'm like, why are you running so much?
[00:54:20] Abby Jorgensen: And she just doesn't.
[00:54:22] Abby Jorgensen: She just thinks that she has to run further so that she can finish this.
[00:54:28] Abby Jorgensen: And I was like, that's, I've told her many times, but she doesn't seem to.
[00:54:33] Gerard Donnelly: All right.
[00:54:34] Gerard Donnelly: Let's move it off.
[00:54:35] Gerard Donnelly: That's I get to.
[00:54:36] Gerard Donnelly: Yeah.
[00:54:37] Gerard Donnelly: Right.
[00:54:39] Gerard Donnelly: How's John going?
[00:54:42] Abby Jorgensen: Fairly.
[00:54:42] Abby Jorgensen: He did really well on his FTP.
[00:54:45] Abby Jorgensen: He had a lot of work that interrupted things last week, but otherwise he's doing good.
[00:54:52] Abby Jorgensen: I know he's getting a new watch today and doing his swim tonight.
[00:54:55] Abby Jorgensen: He just messaged me.
[00:54:57] Gerard Donnelly: So he jumped up 15.
[00:55:01] Gerard Donnelly: Yeah, that's great, Abby.
[00:55:03] Abby Jorgensen: Executed it a lot better, too.
[00:55:05] Gerard Donnelly: Yeah, and had he run before?
[00:55:09] Gerard Donnelly: No.
[00:55:09] Gerard Donnelly: He'd run up 5K.
[00:55:12] Abby Jorgensen: They won't have any because he doesn't have a watch, so he just timed it on a thing and have a watch.
[00:55:23] Gerard Donnelly: He's got a race in December, has he?
[00:55:25] Gerard Donnelly: Yeah.
[00:55:28] Gerard Donnelly: Yeah.
[00:55:30] Gerard Donnelly: So that's like an Olympic distance, is it?
[00:55:33] Abby Jorgensen: Kind of, yeah, a little short of, well, yeah.
[00:55:37] Abby Jorgensen: Yep.
[00:55:37] Gerard Donnelly: Okay.
[00:55:43] Gerard Donnelly: You feel like he's doing the sessions?
[00:55:45] Gerard Donnelly: Like he's missing a few, isn't he?
[00:55:47] Abby Jorgensen: Yeah, that was because of work, because he told me that.
[00:55:49] Abby Jorgensen: Like I, he said work had some crazy stuff.
[00:55:54] Gerard Donnelly: Yep.
[00:55:55] Gerard Donnelly: Look, he's only doing an Olympic.
[00:55:56] Gerard Donnelly: I wouldn't be too fast.
[00:55:58] Gerard Donnelly: Yeah, I just want to get him.
[00:55:59] Abby Jorgensen: him.
[00:56:00] Abby Jorgensen: I think his goal is just to finish it and make sure he likes it before he...
[00:56:03] Gerard Donnelly: Yep.
[00:56:05] Gerard Donnelly: Good.
[00:56:06] Gerard Donnelly: Kevin?
[00:56:08] Gerard Donnelly: Kevin is doing amazing.
[00:56:10] Abby Jorgensen: He did another 20-watt jump.
[00:56:13] Abby Jorgensen: He's improved almost 60, I think 60 or 70 watts since he started.
[00:56:18] Abby Jorgensen: Wow.
[00:56:18] Abby Jorgensen: Where's he from?
[00:56:20] Abby Jorgensen: Norway.
[00:56:22] Abby Jorgensen: Ah, that's right, yes.
[00:56:23] Gerard Donnelly: Yeah.
[00:56:24] Gerard Donnelly: So he started at 229, now he's 290.
[00:56:27] Gerard Donnelly: Oh, God.
[00:56:28] Gerard Donnelly: Yeah.
[00:56:31] Gerard Donnelly: What's his...
[00:56:32] Gerard Donnelly: He must be out of the room.
[00:56:33] Abby Jorgensen: Yeah, he was...
[00:56:34] Abby Jorgensen: I talked to him, what was it, sometime last week or this weekend.
[00:56:39] Abby Jorgensen: Yeah.
[00:56:40] Abby Jorgensen: Look at the correlation between compliance.
[00:56:45] Gerard Donnelly: Right?
[00:56:47] Abby Jorgensen: Like, this guy doesn't miss.
[00:56:49] Abby Jorgensen: Not unless he's traveling, which he hasn't done since, like, the first week I worked with him.
[00:56:54] Abby Jorgensen: And now he's able to add in...
[00:56:56] Abby Jorgensen: We're starting to add in running slowly.
[00:56:58] Abby Jorgensen: Yep.
[00:56:59] Abby Jorgensen: But...
[00:56:59] Abby Jorgensen: Yep.
[00:56:59] Abby Jorgensen: Yep.
[00:57:01] Gerard Donnelly: Does the injury heal?
[00:57:02] Gerard Donnelly: What did he have?
[00:57:05] Abby Jorgensen: Something with the tibialis anterior.
[00:57:08] Abby Jorgensen: So, yeah, we bumped it.
[00:57:13] Abby Jorgensen: Remember, this was the one the physio was like run on an incline.
[00:57:18] Abby Jorgensen: Yes, that's right.
[00:57:19] Gerard Donnelly: Idiot.
[00:57:21] Gerard Donnelly: I mean, I guess.
[00:57:24] Abby Jorgensen: So he says he feels like his calves don't hurt anymore.
[00:57:27] Abby Jorgensen: I'm like, well, I hope not.
[00:57:28] Abby Jorgensen: But the physio said just to add five minutes to a run three times a week.
[00:57:33] Abby Jorgensen: So that's what we did.
[00:57:37] Abby Jorgensen: Good.
[00:57:39] Gerard Donnelly: That's okay.
[00:57:40] Gerard Donnelly: Happy with him.
[00:57:41] Gerard Donnelly: Richard?
[00:57:43] Gerard Donnelly: Rich is good.
[00:57:44] Abby Jorgensen: He just went on a little mini vacation over the weekend if it loads.
[00:57:52] Abby Jorgensen: There we go.
[00:57:54] Abby Jorgensen: Buffalo, okay.
[00:57:55] Gerard Donnelly: Went to a football game.
[00:57:58] Abby Jorgensen: So, yeah, he might.
[00:58:00] Abby Jorgensen: Be home to get to swim in.
[00:58:01] Abby Jorgensen: guess yours is, it's already tomorrow for you, but.
[00:58:03] Abby Jorgensen: Yes, yep.
[00:58:05] Gerard Donnelly: Yeah.
[00:58:05] Gerard Donnelly: It's not there yet.
[00:58:13] Abby Jorgensen: He's in California too, so it's only like four o'clock there.
[00:58:20] Abby Jorgensen: So he usually does his workouts at night.
[00:58:23] Abby Jorgensen: He can still swim, yeah, okay.
[00:58:26] Abby Jorgensen: Yeah, maybe he, I can't remember if he, he might be traveling back today too.
[00:58:30] Abby Jorgensen: I can't remember what, he just told me he'd be at the football game.
[00:58:34] Abby Jorgensen: Yeah.
[00:58:35] Abby Jorgensen: So.
[00:58:35] Abby Jorgensen: Yeah, any problems with Richard, you happy with his?
[00:58:38] Gerard Donnelly: No, yeah, he's good.
[00:58:39] Abby Jorgensen: He communicates well and usually does everything that, we're just slowly getting him back into running too because he had a calf issue.
[00:58:47] Abby Jorgensen: Yeah.
[00:58:48] Abby Jorgensen: But, yeah.
[00:58:50] Abby Jorgensen: And doing the rehab, please.
[00:58:52] Abby Jorgensen: Yeah, we, we started slowly because, yeah, we did the run walk and then he got anxious and then.
[00:59:00] Abby Jorgensen: And he was like, okay, let's go back to run, walk.
[00:59:01] Abby Jorgensen: And I was like, yeah, well, he's okay with everything as easy as possible.
[00:59:07] Gerard Donnelly: Yeah.
[00:59:10] Gerard Donnelly: Michaela's got a little race this weekend.
[00:59:12] Gerard Donnelly: Yep.
[00:59:13] Abby Jorgensen: She did a swim race last weekend and got third, which she was surprised with.
[00:59:20] Gerard Donnelly: Yeah, that's good.
[00:59:22] Abby Jorgensen: Yeah, they have little open water races, I guess, there.
[00:59:25] Abby Jorgensen: I don't know.
[00:59:26] Abby Jorgensen: It seems a little cold still.
[00:59:28] Abby Jorgensen: Yeah, it's freezing.
[00:59:30] Gerard Donnelly: Well, yeah, she was funny.
[00:59:33] Abby Jorgensen: I was like, all right, are ready for the race?
[00:59:34] Abby Jorgensen: She's like, well, I guess I better sign up for it first.
[00:59:37] Abby Jorgensen: I was like, oh, yeah.
[00:59:39] Abby Jorgensen: She wasn't supposed to rain, so she didn't want to race in the rain, but then I convinced her.
[00:59:46] Abby Jorgensen: She's fine.
[00:59:47] Abby Jorgensen: Yep.
[00:59:50] Gerard Donnelly: So she's just picking up some events during the summer?
[00:59:53] Gerard Donnelly: Yep, doing little smaller ones and then has the bigger race in March, isn't it?
[00:59:58] Gerard Donnelly: March or something, yeah.
[01:00:01] Abby Jorgensen: Oh, she's doing a challenge, right?
[01:00:02] Gerard Donnelly: Okay.
[01:00:04] Gerard Donnelly: Yeah.
[01:00:06] Gerard Donnelly: That's the one she wants me to go do.
[01:00:09] Gerard Donnelly: She wants you to go and do it?
[01:00:11] Gerard Donnelly: Yeah, I was like, yeah, you're going to get me there first.
[01:00:16] Gerard Donnelly: What's happened to our favorite, Rihanna?
[01:00:19] Abby Jorgensen: Well, I talked to her today and she says that she, it's nothing against us, but she, I think she is going to cancel because she, she wants a bolder coach and doesn't want to test every four weeks and doesn't, you know, she just wants the vibe is what she said.
[01:00:42] Gerard Donnelly: Yeah, she's impossible to coach.
[01:00:44] Gerard Donnelly: Yeah.
[01:00:45] Abby Jorgensen: I mean, like, I was like, where, I was like, did you do anything over the weekend?
[01:00:48] Abby Jorgensen: She's like, oh, I'm in D.C.
[01:00:50] Abby Jorgensen: I'm like, you should have told me that.
[01:00:53] Abby Jorgensen: But then she was like, can we have a call?
[01:00:56] Abby Jorgensen: And then she was like, listen, it's nothing.
[01:00:57] Abby Jorgensen: It's not you.
[01:00:58] Abby Jorgensen: It's just me.
[01:01:00] Abby Jorgensen: And I'm like, yeah, she's like, you've been great.
[01:01:02] Abby Jorgensen: So, so back to an email from her, I'm like, yep, that's not your fault, Abby.
[01:01:12] Abby Jorgensen: I know, it's like one that I don't have to worry about, but just losing a client at this point.
[01:01:19] Gerard Donnelly: It's, and sometimes they're not the right clients, honestly, it's better, you know, I know it's still a business, but you're still going to enjoy the athletes, so.
[01:01:31] Gerard Donnelly: Kind of like with Michael.
[01:01:33] Gerard Donnelly: What was that?
[01:01:34] Abby Jorgensen: With kind of the same situation with Michael, just, I think, that Abernathy or whatever.
[01:01:40] Abby Jorgensen: Yes.
[01:01:41] Abby Jorgensen: He seemed okay, and then, yeah, it was just like, I just don't think he liked the feedback and the constant, you know.
[01:01:50] Abby Jorgensen: Accountability.
[01:01:51] Abby Jorgensen: Accountability, really, I think it came from it.
[01:01:54] Gerard Donnelly: Yep, and he's the one who's, you know, that's what I need, you know.
[01:01:57] Gerard Donnelly: who's, you know, from the military, and...
[01:02:00] Gerard Donnelly: I want to be guided, and it's so...
[01:02:03] Gerard Donnelly: Yeah, military guys don't like feedback, though.
[01:02:06] Gerard Donnelly: No, no.
[01:02:09] Gerard Donnelly: Especially probably from a woman.
[01:02:11] Gerard Donnelly: It's even worse.
[01:02:12] Gerard Donnelly: Yeah, I've dated military guys.
[01:02:15] Abby Jorgensen: The reason I don't date them anymore.
[01:02:18] Gerard Donnelly: Yeah, well, they're so frigging...
[01:02:21] Gerard Donnelly: They've got it so wrong.
[01:02:26] Gerard Donnelly: Trying to get me started on that one.
[01:02:28] Gerard Donnelly: I know.
[01:02:31] Gerard Donnelly: Racism for male-female, it's a version of...
[01:02:34] Gerard Donnelly: Yeah, terrible.
[01:02:36] Gerard Donnelly: Okay, move on.
[01:02:39] Gerard Donnelly: Blair?
[01:02:41] Gerard Donnelly: Blair's doing good.
[01:02:42] Abby Jorgensen: He was sick a little bit, but I think he's over that.
[01:02:47] Abby Jorgensen: He was funny because it was like...
[01:02:49] Abby Jorgensen: He's like, it snowed here already.
[01:02:51] Abby Jorgensen: He's like, I've never ran on a treadmill.
[01:02:53] Abby Jorgensen: I'm like, what?
[01:02:54] Abby Jorgensen: You've never run on a treadmill?
[01:02:55] Abby Jorgensen: So I had to, like, guide him with, like, you know, one percent inclined.
[01:03:00] Abby Jorgensen: Just go by feel because sometimes the speeds feel way faster than it does outside.
[01:03:06] Abby Jorgensen: So it went well for him.
[01:03:10] Gerard Donnelly: That's great.
[01:03:12] Gerard Donnelly: Pemberton's always going to be a challenge in my mind, but I think you've got her sorted, I hope.
[01:03:18] Abby Jorgensen: Yeah, she seems, I mean, I think I've gotten her personality and her anxious qualities down.
[01:03:31] Abby Jorgensen: Yeah, but other than that, she's hit everything, all her sessions.
[01:03:37] Abby Jorgensen: I know this week she's traveling to New York for job-wise, so we're trying to work around that.
[01:03:43] Abby Jorgensen: Yep.
[01:03:44] Abby Jorgensen: And then next week will be, she travels for Thanksgiving, so we're going to work around that.
[01:03:51] Abby Jorgensen: But she said she's going to take her Wahoo because she wants to, so we'll get some stuff in next week.
[01:03:57] Abby Jorgensen: Yep.
[01:03:58] Abby Jorgensen: I'll have to get all my U.S.
[01:04:00] Abby Jorgensen: Clients figure out what their holiday schedule is here in the next week.
[01:04:03] Abby Jorgensen: It's just the one day, isn't it?
[01:04:05] Abby Jorgensen: Yeah, but sometimes people, like Thursday, Friday, the whole weekend, sometimes they're traveling, so it just depends.
[01:04:13] Gerard Donnelly: Yeah, it's a really important weekend for you.
[01:04:15] Gerard Donnelly: You can get some more training in.
[01:04:16] Gerard Donnelly: It's great.
[01:04:17] Gerard Donnelly: Yeah.
[01:04:19] Abby Jorgensen: But, yeah, sort that out.
[01:04:22] Gerard Donnelly: Yeah, it just depends on the people.
[01:04:23] Abby Jorgensen: Like, I don't go anywhere, so.
[01:04:25] Abby Jorgensen: Yep.
[01:04:27] Gerard Donnelly: Anything with her that's concerning you?
[01:04:30] Gerard Donnelly: Yep.
[01:04:30] Gerard Donnelly: No.
[01:04:32] Abby Jorgensen: Just keeping her anxiety down.
[01:04:34] Abby Jorgensen: Yeah, okay.
[01:04:35] Gerard Donnelly: Oh, you're good at that.
[01:04:40] Gerard Donnelly: How's our mate Glenn from Bali going?
[01:04:44] Abby Jorgensen: I mean, the only thing I'm concerned about is, like, his knee is still bothering him, so we haven't been able to get the runs in, but I'd rather him.
[01:04:51] Abby Jorgensen: And the physio just thinks it's, like, mobility and, like, he needs to stretch, but if it's still hurting, I'm like, he's
[01:05:00] Abby Jorgensen: Going back tomorrow or today, Tuesday, to the physio, like it has to be more than just stretching at this point.
[01:05:07] Abby Jorgensen: There's got to be, I don't know if his knee's not tracking properly.
[01:05:11] Abby Jorgensen: Yeah.
[01:05:12] Abby Jorgensen: Is it okay on the bike?
[01:05:13] Abby Jorgensen: Yeah, he says he's fine on the bike, and then like the first 15, 20 minutes of the run, he seems fine, and then it starts to bother him.
[01:05:21] Gerard Donnelly: I would say it's definitely patella tracking.
[01:05:23] Abby Jorgensen: Yeah, that's what I told him, because then I was like, go try it on the treadmill and just see if it changes your gait a little bit.
[01:05:30] Abby Jorgensen: And he said it felt better to start with, and then it started hurting again.
[01:05:35] Abby Jorgensen: Yeah.
[01:05:35] Abby Jorgensen: Yeah, okay.
[01:05:37] Gerard Donnelly: That's a pity, isn't it?
[01:05:39] Gerard Donnelly: He's going to come into this race under run done.
[01:05:41] Gerard Donnelly: Yeah.
[01:05:42] Abby Jorgensen: So I'm trying to, I'll probably move that run, depending on what the physio says.
[01:05:47] Gerard Donnelly: Yeah.
[01:05:48] Gerard Donnelly: Yeah.
[01:05:48] Gerard Donnelly: Just add some more bikes, zone two stuff.
[01:05:51] Abby Jorgensen: He's also struggling with, well, because he just can't, like, he tried on his wetsuit the other day, and he's like, I can't, obviously, it's so hot in the bottle.
[01:06:00] Abby Jorgensen: So I'm like, and it was like a fiend wrong and he felt, I was like, just put it on, let's move around in it, if anything, so.
[01:06:09] Gerard Donnelly: Yep.
[01:06:12] Gerard Donnelly: Mark?
[01:06:14] Gerard Donnelly: He's good.
[01:06:16] Abby Jorgensen: He said he just lost the surgeon, so his schedule is going to be a little all over the place for a little bit.
[01:06:22] Abby Jorgensen: So I've just been working with him trying to fit in sessions and move them around if needed.
[01:06:28] Gerard Donnelly: Yep.
[01:06:30] Gerard Donnelly: Yep.
[01:06:30] Gerard Donnelly: It seems like, seems like he's compliant.
[01:06:33] Gerard Donnelly: Yeah.
[01:06:34] Abby Jorgensen: And then he wanted a little bit of, wanted to add some, a little bit of strength training in for his lower body, so.
[01:06:40] Abby Jorgensen: Yep.
[01:06:42] Gerard Donnelly: You can fit that in.
[01:06:44] Abby Jorgensen: He can't keep on weight too, so I've been trying to work with him on.
[01:06:47] Abby Jorgensen: Yep.
[01:06:48] Abby Jorgensen: Some of his nutrition a little bit.
[01:06:51] Abby Jorgensen: Good.
[01:06:53] Gerard Donnelly: Phillip?
[01:06:56] Gerard Donnelly: He's good.
[01:06:57] Abby Jorgensen: He should be good.
[01:06:58] Abby Jorgensen: Um.
[01:06:59] Abby Jorgensen: Yep.
[01:07:00] Abby Jorgensen: Sometimes travels and hunts on the weekends right now, but we're working around everything.
[01:07:10] Gerard Donnelly: Okay.
[01:07:13] Gerard Donnelly: No, nothing abnormal there?
[01:07:16] Gerard Donnelly: No.
[01:07:18] Gerard Donnelly: Erin, she's been to Australia and back.
[01:07:22] Gerard Donnelly: I think she goes again for the holidays here too.
[01:07:25] Abby Jorgensen: But Sydney.
[01:07:30] Gerard Donnelly: Did she get the job or?
[01:07:33] Abby Jorgensen: She doesn't know yet.
[01:07:35] Abby Jorgensen: Yep.
[01:07:36] Abby Jorgensen: My big thing right now, we're just trying to, last week she had did four days in a row.
[01:07:41] Abby Jorgensen: So we're just trying to get her consistent again.
[01:07:44] Abby Jorgensen: Yep.
[01:07:45] Gerard Donnelly: What she wants.
[01:07:45] Abby Jorgensen: But then I'm like, she's like going to go back to, I think, I don't know.
[01:07:50] Abby Jorgensen: I think if it was, I don't think it's Thanksgiving.
[01:07:54] Abby Jorgensen: Something.
[01:07:54] Abby Jorgensen: She's going back there for the holidays though.
[01:07:56] Abby Jorgensen: I know that.
[01:07:57] Gerard Donnelly: Yeah.
[01:07:58] Gerard Donnelly: Okay.
[01:07:59] Gerard Donnelly: But it's it.
[01:08:00] Abby Jorgensen: I think she's from Sydney, right?
[01:08:03] Gerard Donnelly: Yes.
[01:08:03] Gerard Donnelly: I'm not sure exactly where.
[01:08:06] Abby Jorgensen: told me Melbourne is not what she doesn't know if she wants to live there because it's not Sydney.
[01:08:16] Gerard Donnelly: There's a big rivalry between Sydney and Melbourne.
[01:08:20] Gerard Donnelly: always has been.
[01:08:21] Gerard Donnelly: I was like, I don't know the difference.
[01:08:23] Abby Jorgensen: They seem the same to me.
[01:08:27] Gerard Donnelly: But that's okay.
[01:08:28] Gerard Donnelly: It doesn't really matter.
[01:08:29] Gerard Donnelly: Sydney's a lot harder place to train than Melbourne.
[01:08:32] Gerard Donnelly: Is it?
[01:08:33] Gerard Donnelly: Yeah, you just don't have.
[01:08:34] Gerard Donnelly: Busier.
[01:08:38] Gerard Donnelly: Melbourne's got this incredible road that runs for about 30 kilometres along the coast that 3,000 4,000 riders use every Saturday and every Sunday.
[01:08:48] Gerard Donnelly: And it's really safe.
[01:08:50] Gerard Donnelly: And Sydney just doesn't have that.
[01:08:53] Gerard Donnelly: It's just so unsafe to ride your bike in Sydney.
[01:08:58] Gerard Donnelly: I mean, be the same.
[01:08:59] Abby Jorgensen: I
[01:09:00] Abby Jorgensen: As here or her in Philly.
[01:09:02] Gerard Donnelly: Yeah, Sydney's the worst, most place to do it.
[01:09:06] Gerard Donnelly: Anyway, Riley?
[01:09:08] Gerard Donnelly: He should be.
[01:09:09] Abby Jorgensen: He's good.
[01:09:10] Abby Jorgensen: I think he's testing this week.
[01:09:14] Abby Jorgensen: If I remember right.
[01:09:17] Gerard Donnelly: If it opens in a minute.
[01:09:22] Gerard Donnelly: He's going slow.
[01:09:25] Gerard Donnelly: Here we go.
[01:09:30] Gerard Donnelly: Yep.
[01:09:32] Gerard Donnelly: So what's your last test?
[01:09:39] Abby Jorgensen: Riley.
[01:09:41] Gerard Donnelly: He's been going great, hasn't he?
[01:09:43] Gerard Donnelly: Yeah.
[01:09:44] Abby Jorgensen: He's one of my really consistent ones, too.
[01:09:48] Abby Jorgensen: Yep.
[01:09:50] Gerard Donnelly: Bachelor Party Week.
[01:09:51] Gerard Donnelly: Jeez.
[01:09:52] Gerard Donnelly: Yeah.
[01:09:54] Abby Jorgensen: Yeah.
[01:09:54] Abby Jorgensen: He asked me if I could move some of his sessions because he's going to be gone.
[01:09:59] Abby Jorgensen: Yep.
[01:10:00] Gerard Donnelly: Yeah, well, good to see.
[01:10:04] Gerard Donnelly: He's not much of a runner, is he?
[01:10:07] Abby Jorgensen: No, he had rolled his ankle, but he, we're back to running, but yeah, he's not like, yeah, he's like a 10, 11 minute mile.
[01:10:17] Abby Jorgensen: Yes.
[01:10:21] Gerard Donnelly: Yeah, well, his last run that he did in September, he really executed poorly with 32 minute first half, 34 minute second half.
[01:10:31] Gerard Donnelly: Whereas his 5Ks, he's nailed them, you know, 16 minutes, then 15, then 17 minutes, then 15.
[01:10:38] Gerard Donnelly: He's got the 10K wrong a bit, didn't he?
[01:10:41] Gerard Donnelly: Mm-hmm.
[01:10:42] Abby Jorgensen: Probably wasn't running that far.
[01:10:45] Gerard Donnelly: Yeah, so be good to see how he goes.
[01:10:49] Abby Jorgensen: I think I remember when we talked for that one, he knew right away.
[01:10:53] Abby Jorgensen: He's like, I definitely will not execute that right.
[01:10:55] Abby Jorgensen: Yeah, and he should be fitter now, so he should be able to handle it a little bit better.
[01:11:00] Gerard Donnelly: But, you know, what's 6.40 pace?
[01:11:05] Gerard Donnelly: That's 6.40.
[01:11:08] Abby Jorgensen: It's like 11, something, I think.
[01:11:12] Gerard Donnelly: That's very slow.
[01:11:14] Gerard Donnelly: 6.40.
[01:11:15] Gerard Donnelly: 10.44.
[01:11:17] Gerard Donnelly: Okay.
[01:11:18] Gerard Donnelly: So maybe getting to start at 10.50, something like that.
[01:11:23] Gerard Donnelly: Okay.
[01:11:26] Gerard Donnelly: Maybe 11, and then see how he goes.
[01:11:31] Gerard Donnelly: With that, okay, we discussed Peter, he's right.
[01:11:35] Gerard Donnelly: Kristen, she's...
[01:11:36] Abby Jorgensen: She just, yeah, I messaged her to try to get on a call with her, but I haven't heard back yet, so...
[01:11:43] Gerard Donnelly: Yep.
[01:11:44] Gerard Donnelly: She's going to pull out.
[01:11:48] Abby Jorgensen: Yeah, I don't know.
[01:11:50] Abby Jorgensen: One minute she'll tell me she wants to get back on something, and the next she wants to do whatever she wants to do.
[01:11:58] Abby Jorgensen: So...
[01:12:00] Gerard Donnelly: Yep.
[01:12:00] Gerard Donnelly: I think she's not paying anyway.
[01:12:03] Gerard Donnelly: So we talked about Dan.
[01:12:07] Gerard Donnelly: How's Jen going from Queensland?
[01:12:10] Gerard Donnelly: I think, well, she was in Sydney.
[01:12:13] Abby Jorgensen: Her mom had to message me because her phone was broken and tell me that she's still waiting.
[01:12:21] Abby Jorgensen: I she's supposed to, she told me when she got back to her Monday, she's, or yeah, she was supposed to go get the Wahoo.
[01:12:30] Abby Jorgensen: So hopefully we can finally get that started.
[01:12:34] Abby Jorgensen: Yep.
[01:12:37] Gerard Donnelly: Biggest thing is her schedule.
[01:12:40] Abby Jorgensen: It's just, you know, she has that one hour every day and that's about it, except for the week.
[01:12:46] Gerard Donnelly: So that's okay.
[01:12:47] Gerard Donnelly: We'll just do our best to fit her in for that one hour.
[01:12:49] Gerard Donnelly: Just change the warmup and cool down, Abby, to make it fit.
[01:12:53] Abby Jorgensen: Yep.
[01:12:55] Gerard Donnelly: Don't give her any reason, you know, for example, the FTP test, you'd take out that, you know.
[01:13:00] Gerard Donnelly: So then she's got a 53-minute ride.
[01:13:04] Gerard Donnelly: And so just make it so that everything's under an hour.
[01:13:08] Gerard Donnelly: We just want her to be consistent.
[01:13:10] Gerard Donnelly: That's her first goal.
[01:13:11] Gerard Donnelly: She's not trying to do anything more than get her to be consistent.
[01:13:16] Gerard Donnelly: What's her mum like?
[01:13:19] Abby Jorgensen: Mum's doing a lot better consistency-wise.
[01:13:23] Abby Jorgensen: Yep.
[01:13:28] Abby Jorgensen: I don't know what they're barking at.
[01:13:32] Gerard Donnelly: The wind.
[01:13:33] Gerard Donnelly: I know.
[01:13:34] Gerard Donnelly: You've been on the phone too long.
[01:13:35] Gerard Donnelly: That's what they're barking They've had me home all day.
[01:13:38] Abby Jorgensen: I don't know.
[01:13:39] Abby Jorgensen: I left to go work out and get my hair cut.
[01:13:43] Abby Jorgensen: We're so needy.
[01:13:48] Gerard Donnelly: There's a few athletes in that category.
[01:13:50] Gerard Donnelly: Yeah.
[01:13:51] Gerard Donnelly: Have you heard from Nancy?
[01:13:54] Abby Jorgensen: Yeah, she texted me Saturday.
[01:13:57] Abby Jorgensen: She watches...
[01:13:58] Abby Jorgensen: watches...
[01:13:59] Abby Jorgensen: She watches...
[01:13:59] Abby Jorgensen: watches...
[01:13:59] Abby Jorgensen: She
[01:14:00] Abby Jorgensen: The football games, and she always messages me about the Hawkeyes and other random stuff.
[01:14:06] Abby Jorgensen: She messages me a lot for somebody who doesn't want to be coached.
[01:14:09] Gerard Donnelly: Yeah, it's just ridiculous, isn't it?
[01:14:11] Gerard Donnelly: I mean.
[01:14:13] Gerard Donnelly: All right, well, Karen's due.
[01:14:21] Gerard Donnelly: She's in week three, so she'll get tested next week.
[01:14:24] Gerard Donnelly: Yeah, I have it on there because it's her.
[01:14:25] Abby Jorgensen: She has that run, too, so I was just going to use that for her.
[01:14:28] Abby Jorgensen: Yeah, great.
[01:14:29] Gerard Donnelly: Fantastic.
[01:14:30] Gerard Donnelly: Yep.
[01:14:31] Gerard Donnelly: Yep.
[01:14:31] Abby Jorgensen: The biggest thing with her is, I told her that, I gave her the goal this week is just to get her cadence up on some of the stuff.
[01:14:39] Abby Jorgensen: She's just so used to, I think, just.
[01:14:41] Abby Jorgensen: Grinding.
[01:14:42] Abby Jorgensen: Grinding and not knowing any different, but she's hitting her workouts, so.
[01:14:49] Abby Jorgensen: Yeah, she was pretty keen.
[01:14:51] Gerard Donnelly: She's very enthusiastic in her interview.
[01:14:56] Gerard Donnelly: Yeah, she's, I mean, I told I told her.
[01:15:00] Abby Jorgensen: When she messaged me about Jen, I was like, oh, here, I thought Jen was just ignoring me.
[01:15:03] Abby Jorgensen: She's like, who would ignore you?
[01:15:04] Abby Jorgensen: And I was like, I don't know.
[01:15:06] Abby Jorgensen: I'm sure somebody would.
[01:15:08] Gerard Donnelly: Yeah, you're right.
[01:15:10] Gerard Donnelly: She's way at the top of the range here.
[01:15:13] Abby Jorgensen: Yeah, I think when she tested originally, it just, she didn't know how.
[01:15:17] Abby Jorgensen: So I think her FTP will probably be a lot higher this time.
[01:15:20] Gerard Donnelly: Yeah, tell her, you know, you can be back at 140 if you want to, Karen, and get this up.
[01:15:28] Gerard Donnelly: Yep.
[01:15:30] Gerard Donnelly: Get that cadence.
[01:15:31] Gerard Donnelly: 70s is no good.
[01:15:33] Gerard Donnelly: Yeah, 80s.
[01:15:34] Gerard Donnelly: At least.
[01:15:35] Gerard Donnelly: It is.
[01:15:36] Abby Jorgensen: Before I joined, like, 70s felt good.
[01:15:39] Abby Jorgensen: Normal, yep.
[01:15:40] Gerard Donnelly: I'm just happy.
[01:15:42] Gerard Donnelly: Bill?
[01:15:43] Abby Jorgensen: Bill's good.
[01:15:44] Abby Jorgensen: He did a gravel race past weekend.
[01:15:49] Gerard Donnelly: Yep.
[01:15:49] Abby Jorgensen: That was quite the experience.
[01:15:55] Abby Jorgensen: He's like, it is a lot of, like, over-under and just a lot of, like, vibration on
[01:16:00] Abby Jorgensen: The body, things like that, but he enjoyed it.
[01:16:05] Abby Jorgensen: Yeah.
[01:16:05] Abby Jorgensen: He's like, I'll do another one, but it's not something I'll do a lot of.
[01:16:09] Abby Jorgensen: He's like, he has a nice little break and doing something.
[01:16:11] Abby Jorgensen: Yeah.
[01:16:12] Abby Jorgensen: It's also getting a little colder there too now.
[01:16:15] Abby Jorgensen: So just, uh, he's like North Carolina.
[01:16:19] Abby Jorgensen: So they had a cold spell.
[01:16:21] Abby Jorgensen: He was, he was, uh, I don't know.
[01:16:24] Abby Jorgensen: He said it got like a 40 degree drop.
[01:16:26] Abby Jorgensen: So like down into like the thirties there is cold, but I was like, well, it was 10 degrees here.
[01:16:36] Gerard Donnelly: Um, what's his next race?
[01:16:40] Abby Jorgensen: Um, he does White Lake and try it.
[01:16:46] Abby Jorgensen: That was like his first race when he joined us.
[01:16:48] Abby Jorgensen: I think it's March maybe.
[01:16:52] Gerard Donnelly: It's nothing, nothing in the thing, but yeah, just, just put that in here, you know, No, no,
[01:17:00] Gerard Donnelly: Start with the week and hide it for me so we can.
[01:17:03] Gerard Donnelly: All right, well, I think any other questions on anybody that we've skipped over or skimmed over that you've, I can get rid of.
[01:17:12] Abby Jorgensen: Do you have anybody, have you interviewed anybody else?
[01:17:15] Gerard Donnelly: Yes, I have.
[01:17:18] Gerard Donnelly: I'm just going to have a look up.
[01:17:20] Gerard Donnelly: I've got a couple of interviews coming up.
[01:17:24] Gerard Donnelly: A guy from, he just emailed me this morning.
[01:17:30] Gerard Donnelly: So let me look at the email.
[01:17:33] Gerard Donnelly: Mario.
[01:17:34] Gerard Donnelly: Mario, he lives in Mountain Standard Time.
[01:17:39] Gerard Donnelly: So I wonder where that is.
[01:17:42] Gerard Donnelly: Mountain Standard Time?
[01:17:44] Gerard Donnelly: So Colorado, Utah?
[01:17:46] Gerard Donnelly: Yeah, that's not far from you, is it?
[01:17:48] Gerard Donnelly: No.
[01:17:51] Gerard Donnelly: Somehow he applied a week ago and he gave us the wrong email address.
[01:17:55] Gerard Donnelly: And so Floyd has been reaching out to him.
[01:17:59] Gerard Donnelly: I'm saying to Floyd.
[01:17:59] Gerard Donnelly: I'm I'm Thank
[01:18:00] Gerard Donnelly: What's going on?
[01:18:01] Gerard Donnelly: He applies.
[01:18:02] Gerard Donnelly: don't hear from him.
[01:18:04] Gerard Donnelly: And anyway, I found another email address for him.
[01:18:11] Gerard Donnelly: And he's applied straight away.
[01:18:14] Gerard Donnelly: Like, yeah, that's fine.
[01:18:20] Abby Jorgensen: No, I mean, I think everybody now, now that I got, mean, now that Rihanna's leaving and then Michael left, but yeah, everybody else is really.
[01:18:32] Gerard Donnelly: Yeah, it still shocks you, doesn't it?
[01:18:34] Gerard Donnelly: When people leave, it's, it's, it's.
[01:18:36] Gerard Donnelly: Yeah, it's hard for me because you build those relationships too.
[01:18:39] Abby Jorgensen: And yeah, it's hard.
[01:18:41] Abby Jorgensen: Yeah, you're working real hard.
[01:18:43] Gerard Donnelly: And so Mario's the next person.
[01:18:47] Gerard Donnelly: Dan, I thought was going to be okay.
[01:18:50] Gerard Donnelly: There's another girl from, I think she's from the Netherlands, Santa.
[01:18:56] Gerard Donnelly: She's applied twice and said, I'm ready to go.
[01:18:58] Gerard Donnelly: First time she applied.
[01:19:00] Gerard Donnelly: Then she said, oh, I changed my mind.
[01:19:01] Gerard Donnelly: Then she's applied again.
[01:19:02] Gerard Donnelly: I've reached out to her three times now.
[01:19:04] Gerard Donnelly: I'm going, am I missing something?
[01:19:06] Gerard Donnelly: You've applied twice and now I can't get a hold of you again.
[01:19:13] Gerard Donnelly: I had another guy who agreed to start, Ben Goodman from New Zealand, and then he didn't fill in any of the forms.
[01:19:22] Gerard Donnelly: So we emailed him twice.
[01:19:24] Gerard Donnelly: I got Floyd to text him and then I rang him and he was so flippant.
[01:19:31] Gerard Donnelly: He says, oh, I think I'll go with a local coach.
[01:19:34] Gerard Donnelly: And I said, why don't you just answer the emails and tell us that?
[01:19:38] Gerard Donnelly: We've been holding a spot.
[01:19:39] Gerard Donnelly: You agreed to join.
[01:19:41] Gerard Donnelly: You know, the courteous thing would be to tell us, wouldn't it?
[01:19:46] Gerard Donnelly: Yeah.
[01:19:46] Gerard Donnelly: I mean, that's like with the gym we were trying to do.
[01:19:49] Abby Jorgensen: Like the guy, like, was all excited to start and we were going to do the demo and do everything.
[01:19:54] Abby Jorgensen: And then he just ghosted us.
[01:19:56] Abby Jorgensen: Like I messaged him three times, called him like nothing.
[01:19:59] Abby Jorgensen: Yeah.
[01:19:59] Abby Jorgensen: I'm
[01:20:00] Abby Jorgensen: Like, just be courteous and tell us.
[01:20:02] Abby Jorgensen: Yeah, let us know.
[01:20:03] Gerard Donnelly: Yeah, well, we big people, we can accept that you don't want to be coached by us, but just tell us, you know?
[01:20:10] Gerard Donnelly: Frustrating.
[01:20:12] Gerard Donnelly: He got quite defensive and was a little bit aggressive.
[01:20:16] Gerard Donnelly: And he said, oh, I'm allowed to do whatever I like.
[01:20:18] Gerard Donnelly: You can't tell me what to do.
[01:20:20] Gerard Donnelly: I said, I'm not telling you what to do.
[01:20:21] Gerard Donnelly: I'm just saying, you know, when people have an agreement, that if you change your mind, it's absolutely okay, Ben.
[01:20:31] Gerard Donnelly: But just tell me.
[01:20:34] Gerard Donnelly: Don't leave me hanging here.
[01:20:37] Gerard Donnelly: And eventually he goes, oh, yeah, fair enough.
[01:20:40] Gerard Donnelly: I was like, yeah, settle down.
[01:20:45] Gerard Donnelly: Yeah.
[01:20:46] Abby Jorgensen: I never understood.
[01:20:47] Abby Jorgensen: Do you guys celebrate?
[01:20:48] Abby Jorgensen: You guys don't celebrate Thanksgiving, do you?
[01:20:50] Gerard Donnelly: No, no.
[01:20:52] Gerard Donnelly: Do you have anything?
[01:20:54] Gerard Donnelly: No?
[01:20:54] Gerard Donnelly: Sorry?
[01:20:55] Gerard Donnelly: No, we have a ridiculous holiday, Abby.
[01:21:00] Gerard Donnelly: For a horse race, and the Melbourne Cup is apparently some famous horse race, and we have a holiday on a Tuesday for the Melbourne Cup on the first Tuesday in November, so everybody has Saturday, Sunday, Monday, Tuesday off, same as what you're doing for Thanksgiving.
[01:21:18] Gerard Donnelly: People don't even care that there's a horse race, but we have that holiday.
[01:21:23] Gerard Donnelly: Maybe it's a little crazy for the Kentucky Derby here, but.
[01:21:27] Gerard Donnelly: Yes, similar, yeah.
[01:21:28] Gerard Donnelly: I don't understand it.
[01:21:32] Abby Jorgensen: Actually, Michaela went to some horse races in New Zealand, like a couple weeks ago.
[01:21:38] Abby Jorgensen: Yeah.
[01:21:39] Abby Jorgensen: I don't know.
[01:21:40] Abby Jorgensen: She didn't want to train.
[01:21:44] Gerard Donnelly: So I've got Mario, who'd be, that would be one back.
[01:21:49] Gerard Donnelly: Yeah.
[01:21:53] Gerard Donnelly: And really, I don't have any other...
[01:21:59] Gerard Donnelly: It's Yeah.
[01:21:59] Gerard Donnelly: Yeah.
[01:21:59] Gerard Donnelly: Yeah.
[01:21:59] Gerard Donnelly: You
[01:22:00] Gerard Donnelly: So that's Santa, Santa Vanda, her name is Santa Vanda R, I'll keep pursuing her, Mario, and there's a new girl, Odette, I was supposed to meet her yesterday, she cancelled the interview, I don't know why, and there's a new guy, Ben, who applied yesterday, so another girl, Bella, applied and then disappeared.
[01:22:31] Gerard Donnelly: So, so there's kind of, it's hard to keep up with, people apply, and they send this really enthusiastic application saying, hey, I want to do this and this, and then you reply to them, and then you don't hear from them, I don't understand.
[01:22:46] Abby Jorgensen: And this generation sometimes, I don't know.
[01:22:49] Abby Jorgensen: Yeah, it's quite, quite flippant.
[01:22:52] Gerard Donnelly: So yeah, I'm actively pursuing to get you, Mario will be next, so.
[01:22:59] Gerard Donnelly: Okay.
[01:23:01] Gerard Donnelly: So, yeah, if Michael's out, and then, who was the other person?
[01:23:08] Abby Jorgensen: Rihanna.
[01:23:09] Abby Jorgensen: Oh, Rihanna, yes.
[01:23:10] Gerard Donnelly: So that'll bring you back to 22, won't it?
[01:23:14] Gerard Donnelly: Oh, yeah, 22 or 23.
[01:23:16] Abby Jorgensen: Yep.
[01:23:21] Gerard Donnelly: Yep, okay.
[01:23:22] Gerard Donnelly: And hopefully if we can get, what's his name?
[01:23:31] Gerard Donnelly: Mario Hidalgo.
[01:23:35] Gerard Donnelly: And he wants to do the New Mexico 70.3.
[01:23:40] Gerard Donnelly: That was his goal.
[01:23:44] Gerard Donnelly: I'm sure there's going to be more people applying, so.
[01:23:47] Abby Jorgensen: Yeah, it's kind of like that time of year, too, where it's the holidays and.
[01:23:51] Abby Jorgensen: Yes, yeah.
[01:23:53] Gerard Donnelly: We've actually got a bit of a dilemma where people are ringing up to try to pause for four weeks or six weeks.
[01:23:59] Gerard Donnelly: We've got people try try try to try
[01:24:00] Gerard Donnelly: We don't want that for their own best interest to pause.
[01:24:04] Gerard Donnelly: They don't do the program.
[01:24:05] Gerard Donnelly: They come back worse than they left, and then you spend all this time getting them fit again.
[01:24:10] Gerard Donnelly: I hate that cycle.
[01:24:13] Gerard Donnelly: Continuity is what gives you the improvement, not on, off, on, off.
[01:24:21] Gerard Donnelly: Anyway.
[01:24:22] Gerard Donnelly: Yeah.
[01:24:24] Gerard Donnelly: We're having discussions on that.
[01:24:27] Abby Jorgensen: Do you guys do, like, Christmas, though, and have that big holiday, right?
[01:24:32] Abby Jorgensen: Our Christmas is enormous because it's summer.
[01:24:35] Gerard Donnelly: Oh, yeah.
[01:24:36] Gerard Donnelly: So everybody here at December has four weeks off annual leave or two weeks annual leave.
[01:24:44] Gerard Donnelly: So people would have from the Tuesday before Christmas all the way through to New Year, and then maybe the next week they would have all that time off.
[01:24:54] Gerard Donnelly: And, you know, that's the hottest period of our year, December, January.
[01:24:58] Gerard Donnelly: So...
[01:24:59] Gerard Donnelly: So...
[01:25:00] Gerard Donnelly: It's, you know, 90 to 110 degrees from basically from December through to April.
[01:25:08] Gerard Donnelly: So our holiday period is Christmas all the way through to the middle of January for most Australians.
[01:25:17] Gerard Donnelly: Okay.
[01:25:18] Gerard Donnelly: So just like your July, you would have your vacation holiday period when it's the hottest time, obviously.
[01:25:26] Gerard Donnelly: So do they, how's the school systems run there then?
[01:25:31] Gerard Donnelly: Yeah, it's interesting because we just have calendar year.
[01:25:34] Gerard Donnelly: So, so you start school in February.
[01:25:37] Gerard Donnelly: So the kids have, all the kids have January off.
[01:25:40] Gerard Donnelly: Okay.
[01:25:41] Gerard Donnelly: And they have most of December off.
[01:25:43] Gerard Donnelly: They have, they have eight weeks or six weeks depending on.
[01:25:47] Gerard Donnelly: And so they start school in February.
[01:25:49] Gerard Donnelly: So if you start, you know, your very first high school year, you would start in February and you go all the way to December.
[01:25:55] Gerard Donnelly: Then you go to the next year, go to the next level.
[01:25:58] Gerard Donnelly: So you guys go from July.
[01:26:10] Gerard Donnelly: It makes more sense because we always have to argue over whether you can You kindergarten depending on when your birthday is.
[01:26:34] Abby Jorgensen: Yeah.
[01:26:38] Abby Jorgensen: All right.
[01:26:40] Gerard Donnelly: Are you feeling okay?
[01:26:42] Gerard Donnelly: Are you happy with everything?
[01:26:44] Gerard Donnelly: Yeah.
[01:26:45] Gerard Donnelly: mean, my testing week went good.
[01:26:46] Abby Jorgensen: My legs were a little tired by the end of the week.
[01:26:49] Abby Jorgensen: But other than that, like, yeah, my runs have been feeling good.
[01:26:55] Abby Jorgensen: But, yeah, I think I put too much pressure on my 10K because I know what I'm capable of.
[01:27:01] Abby Jorgensen: Yeah, that'll come.
[01:27:02] Gerard Donnelly: Don't worry.
[01:27:03] Gerard Donnelly: I want you to try and get into some of these races.
[01:27:10] Gerard Donnelly: I'll try to get 5K next week.
[01:27:13] Gerard Donnelly: Yeah, that'll be good.
[01:27:15] Gerard Donnelly: Let's do that.
[01:27:16] Gerard Donnelly: Yeah.
[01:27:17] Abby Jorgensen: Sometimes you can just jump in to those without paying for them.
[01:27:21] Abby Jorgensen: We'll see.
[01:27:22] Gerard Donnelly: Yeah.
[01:27:22] Gerard Donnelly: Good.
[01:27:25] Gerard Donnelly: All right.
[01:27:25] Gerard Donnelly: Have a good week.
[01:27:27] Gerard Donnelly: Anything else?
[01:27:28] Gerard Donnelly: you know, and I'll keep you updated with who's and when Mario has an interview and hopefully we can get, I'll chase up Santa as well.
[01:27:39] Gerard Donnelly: Okay.
[01:27:40] Abby Jorgensen: Sounds good.
[01:27:42] Abby Jorgensen: Yep.
[01:27:43] Gerard Donnelly: All right.
[01:27:43] Gerard Donnelly: Good to talk.
[01:27:44] Gerard Donnelly: See you.
[01:27:44] Gerard Donnelly: All right.
[01:27:44] Gerard Donnelly: See you.
