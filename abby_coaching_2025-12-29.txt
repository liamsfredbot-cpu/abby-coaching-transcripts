[00:00:00] Gerard Donnelly: Yep.
[00:00:01] Gerard Donnelly: Yeah.
[00:00:05] Gerard Donnelly: And the weather?
[00:00:07] Abby Jorgensen: I mean, it's negative seven Celsius right now.
[00:00:12] Abby Jorgensen: Yep.
[00:00:13] Abby Jorgensen: So, yeah, and we got, like, ice, sleet, and snow, blizzard conditions yesterday.
[00:00:21] Abby Jorgensen: Yep.
[00:00:22] Abby Jorgensen: So.
[00:00:24] Abby Jorgensen: It made it hard.
[00:00:26] Abby Jorgensen: Back to winter.
[00:00:29] Gerard Donnelly: How did you feel during the week?
[00:00:31] Gerard Donnelly: coping okay?
[00:00:33] Gerard Donnelly: Yeah, during the week I was fine.
[00:00:35] Abby Jorgensen: Saturday's run just, I don't know, if it was just because I did it on Saturday, I'm not used to that, and I had to do it a little early because I had to go do some things Saturday.
[00:00:47] Abby Jorgensen: Yeah.
[00:00:48] Abby Jorgensen: But, yeah, I don't know, it just felt long.
[00:00:52] Abby Jorgensen: Yeah, okay.
[00:00:53] Abby Jorgensen: I mean, other than that.
[00:00:55] Abby Jorgensen: Yep, they are long.
[00:00:57] Abby Jorgensen: Yeah, it's long.
[00:00:58] Abby Jorgensen: And I did it in the morning, and it was kind
[00:00:59] Abby Jorgensen: It of dark and maybe by myself, it was kind of lonely.
[00:01:04] Abby Jorgensen: Is it?
[00:01:04] Abby Jorgensen: 16 degrees, that's not too bad.
[00:01:08] Abby Jorgensen: Yeah, Saturday, it's been like 30s and 40s Fahrenheit until yesterday.
[00:01:14] Abby Jorgensen: Yeah, I'd be happy with that, my goodness.
[00:01:17] Abby Jorgensen: Yeah, it's been like foggy for like, we hadn't seen the sun until today for probably about a week, so.
[00:01:25] Abby Jorgensen: Yep, yep.
[00:01:26] Gerard Donnelly: How'd you go with the six-minute efforts?
[00:01:33] Abby Jorgensen: Those didn't feel, I mean, I had to obviously do that inside because that was Saturday.
[00:01:38] Abby Jorgensen: They didn't feel bad.
[00:01:40] Abby Jorgensen: mean, I did like eight miles an hour, so that should have equated to about 7.30, 7.25 pace outside, but.
[00:01:50] Abby Jorgensen: Is that about right, the heart rate?
[00:01:53] Abby Jorgensen: Yeah, what, 160s?
[00:01:56] Gerard Donnelly: 165 for max at the end.
[00:01:58] Gerard Donnelly: Yeah, that's probably about right for those.
[00:01:59] Abby Jorgensen: 165
[00:02:04] Gerard Donnelly: So 158 average, 155.
[00:02:09] Gerard Donnelly: Yeah, I did it after the bike too, so I mean, yeah, that's good.
[00:02:13] Abby Jorgensen: I always feel better after the bike anyway.
[00:02:15] Abby Jorgensen: Yeah, interesting.
[00:02:17] Gerard Donnelly: How'd you go with the bike?
[00:02:19] Gerard Donnelly: It was good.
[00:02:20] Abby Jorgensen: I didn't, I always think by the end I'm kind of faded, but this, these ones felt okay.
[00:02:27] Abby Jorgensen: Yeah, your four minute efforts are good.
[00:02:34] Gerard Donnelly: That's great.
[00:02:35] Gerard Donnelly: Really good.
[00:02:38] Gerard Donnelly: You're getting your heart rate up as well by the end, so 159, 160.
[00:02:45] Gerard Donnelly: How are you coping with the 60, 60s?
[00:02:48] Gerard Donnelly: I feel like those are...
[00:02:49] Gerard Donnelly: Easy.
[00:02:51] Abby Jorgensen: Easier compared to the 40s or the 30s.
[00:02:55] Abby Jorgensen: don't know why.
[00:02:56] Abby Jorgensen: I think that extra minute of rest is...
[00:02:59] Abby Jorgensen: Rest, yeah.
[00:03:00] Gerard Donnelly: Yeah, where you're getting up to 250s, that's really good.
[00:03:03] Gerard Donnelly: Up at the range, great cadence.
[00:03:06] Gerard Donnelly: And the heart rate's really up there in the 170s.
[00:03:10] Gerard Donnelly: That's what we want.
[00:03:13] Gerard Donnelly: It's great.
[00:03:14] Gerard Donnelly: Really good.
[00:03:15] Gerard Donnelly: Good.
[00:03:17] Gerard Donnelly: The hill repeats?
[00:03:20] Gerard Donnelly: Those felt harder this week.
[00:03:22] Abby Jorgensen: I don't know why.
[00:03:23] Abby Jorgensen: Yep.
[00:03:24] Abby Jorgensen: But on the treadmill, so.
[00:03:27] Abby Jorgensen: But I go at 6% and then.
[00:03:30] Abby Jorgensen: Yep.
[00:03:31] Abby Jorgensen: So.
[00:03:36] Gerard Donnelly: That's good.
[00:03:36] Gerard Donnelly: Your heart rate's not through the roof.
[00:03:40] Gerard Donnelly: I think just running up hill was hard anyway, isn't it?
[00:03:43] Gerard Donnelly: Yeah, I mean it.
[00:03:46] Gerard Donnelly: Well, we're really trying to get, you know, trying to get that 60 to 70 distance, kilometres, which is, what's that, 40 miles?
[00:04:00] Abby Jorgensen: Yeah, it was 42 this week.
[00:04:03] Abby Jorgensen: Yep.
[00:04:04] Gerard Donnelly: we've done quite well with that recovery week.
[00:04:08] Gerard Donnelly: And so you've consistently had that 60, 60, you know, 60 in the recovery week, obviously, is a little bit lower with 40.
[00:04:18] Gerard Donnelly: And then we're back to 64, 67, 68.
[00:04:23] Gerard Donnelly: And this should be closer to 70.
[00:04:26] Gerard Donnelly: So this is your last week, obviously.
[00:04:30] Gerard Donnelly: So we just keep adding a little bit of time.
[00:04:35] Gerard Donnelly: And, yeah, depending on, I don't know, what you can do with the testing week here, whether we can try and run, you know, 5 or 10K on the treadmill if there's no outside race available with the weather.
[00:04:55] Gerard Donnelly: Yeah, there is not.
[00:04:58] Abby Jorgensen: But the next, like...
[00:04:59] Abby Jorgensen: like...
[00:05:00] Abby Jorgensen: The next race that I've seen on the calendar is, like, there's a race on, like, Valentine's Day in February.
[00:05:07] Abby Jorgensen: Yep.
[00:05:08] Abby Jorgensen: But, again, like, you never know what the weather's going to do.
[00:05:13] Abby Jorgensen: It's around the 21st, is it?
[00:05:17] Gerard Donnelly: 14th.
[00:05:18] Gerard Donnelly: 14th.
[00:05:19] Abby Jorgensen: Where do you know what that is?
[00:05:20] Abby Jorgensen: I mean, I don't really celebrate it.
[00:05:26] Abby Jorgensen: I mean, it's supposed to be back in the 40s this weekend, so I should be able to get outside this week.
[00:05:32] Abby Jorgensen: Yep.
[00:05:33] Gerard Donnelly: If you can run a 5 or a 10K outside the following week, that would be really good.
[00:05:38] Gerard Donnelly: Okay.
[00:05:38] Abby Jorgensen: Yeah, we'll see what the extended forecast looks like.
[00:05:42] Gerard Donnelly: Yep, and just move it to any of those, you know, next week we can move it to anywhere.
[00:05:47] Gerard Donnelly: Just pick the best day.
[00:05:50] Gerard Donnelly: It's not the same running by yourself as you are in a race, it's not, but we don't have a choice.
[00:05:56] Abby Jorgensen: No, yeah, for sure.
[00:05:57] Abby Jorgensen: There's also, my friend.
[00:06:00] Abby Jorgensen: Sign me up.
[00:06:00] Abby Jorgensen: There's a YMCA triathlon inside on the 24th, and it's literally like 400 meter swim, like a seven mile spin bike, and a two mile run on the treadmill.
[00:06:13] Abby Jorgensen: That'd be great.
[00:06:16] Gerard Donnelly: It won't be much.
[00:06:17] Abby Jorgensen: I'll probably have to do something afterwards, I'm sure.
[00:06:19] Abby Jorgensen: That's right.
[00:06:20] Abby Jorgensen: What's it called?
[00:06:21] Abby Jorgensen: It's just, it's, I don't know, an inside tri.
[00:06:25] Abby Jorgensen: I don't know.
[00:06:25] Abby Jorgensen: It's for a charity event.
[00:06:30] Gerard Donnelly: Good.
[00:06:31] Gerard Donnelly: Okay, let's do that.
[00:06:33] Gerard Donnelly: 400.
[00:06:34] Gerard Donnelly: 400.
[00:06:37] Abby Jorgensen: And two.
[00:06:38] Abby Jorgensen: Yeah.
[00:06:42] Abby Jorgensen: Which I should be able to, it's on a treadmill, so I'll just set the speed up, see what I'm capable of for two miles on the treadmill.
[00:06:50] Abby Jorgensen: Probably pretty effective.
[00:06:52] Gerard Donnelly: Good stuff.
[00:06:55] Gerard Donnelly: All right, we just want to make sure that there's no...
[00:06:58] Gerard Donnelly: All no...
[00:06:59] Gerard Donnelly: All
[00:07:00] Gerard Donnelly: Fatigue that you're experiencing?
[00:07:01] Gerard Donnelly: Your legs aren't getting smashed?
[00:07:05] Gerard Donnelly: Everything's all right?
[00:07:07] Abby Jorgensen: Yeah, like, yeah, after Saturday, it probably didn't help that Saturday I went up to my best friend's brother has a farm up in Northern Iowa and we went up there and worked.
[00:07:17] Abby Jorgensen: And I woke up Sunday and it was kind of a wreck, but I did fine.
[00:07:21] Abby Jorgensen: Yeah, that was after your run.
[00:07:23] Abby Jorgensen: Oh my goodness, that's a big day.
[00:07:25] Abby Jorgensen: Yeah, that's why I did it early and then I went up there to, I don't get to do a whole lot sometimes, so I went up there and spent some time up there.
[00:07:36] Abby Jorgensen: But yeah, my legs recovered pretty well going into Sunday.
[00:07:40] Abby Jorgensen: I was surprised.
[00:07:41] Abby Jorgensen: Maybe just being on my feet and moving around helped, I think.
[00:07:43] Gerard Donnelly: Yeah, yeah, that's a great session, Sunday.
[00:07:47] Gerard Donnelly: Well done.
[00:07:49] Gerard Donnelly: Yeah, if just replicate this and, you know, the journey that we always talk about, you know, people get bored with the journey.
[00:07:59] Gerard Donnelly: that we about,
[00:08:00] Gerard Donnelly: You've got to love the journey.
[00:08:01] Gerard Donnelly: You've got to know that every day I'm getting fitter.
[00:08:03] Gerard Donnelly: And you are.
[00:08:04] Gerard Donnelly: You're getting fitter, Abby, as a runner.
[00:08:06] Gerard Donnelly: And you're still maintaining your swimming and riding.
[00:08:08] Gerard Donnelly: And, you know, to be able to ride those numbers, your FTP is not dropping off.
[00:08:12] Gerard Donnelly: So, and don't underestimate how valuable that 6060 VO2 session is and the endurance ride is contributing to your overall aerobic fitness.
[00:08:24] Gerard Donnelly: So, you know, you should be getting that strong feeling at the end of these long runs, not fading feeling.
[00:08:30] Gerard Donnelly: Yeah.
[00:08:30] Gerard Donnelly: I don't mean you feel better, but you don't feel like you're weak at the end.
[00:08:35] Gerard Donnelly: Yeah.
[00:08:36] Abby Jorgensen: I've been trying to, like, the last mile or last five to ten minutes, try to pick up the pace and just see if it feels comparatively.
[00:08:43] Abby Jorgensen: Yeah.
[00:08:43] Abby Jorgensen: Just keep practicing that.
[00:08:44] Abby Jorgensen: That's fine.
[00:08:46] Gerard Donnelly: Anything else on you?
[00:08:49] Abby Jorgensen: No, I was just trying to decide for my full race calendar because it's more of a money issue at this point where it's like, so if I registered for the two marathons,
[00:09:00] Abby Jorgensen: And then this one 70.3 in June.
[00:09:03] Abby Jorgensen: Yep.
[00:09:04] Abby Jorgensen: And then I thought maybe another 70.3, but then spending another $500 is like one of those things.
[00:09:11] Abby Jorgensen: I don't know.
[00:09:14] Gerard Donnelly: Let's have these goals and just think about what are my goals if I could afford it.
[00:09:21] Gerard Donnelly: Okay.
[00:09:22] Gerard Donnelly: Let's have those first and then we'll work out.
[00:09:26] Gerard Donnelly: But if you want to do, you know, a 70.3, pick the one that you want to do the most.
[00:09:34] Gerard Donnelly: And if we can absolutely just keep pushing you with more clients to get more income.
[00:09:43] Gerard Donnelly: And once you hit that next level, you know, your pay goes up anyway.
[00:09:49] Gerard Donnelly: So, yeah, there's all these opportunities to, to, there's two people.
[00:09:59] Gerard Donnelly: There's opportunities.
[00:10:00] Gerard Donnelly: I'm waiting to interview.
[00:10:00] Gerard Donnelly: I'm interviewing one on the 5th and this other guy, Adam.
[00:10:04] Gerard Donnelly: I haven't got an interview date from him yet.
[00:10:09] Gerard Donnelly: So there's two more, but Patricia is on the 5th.
[00:10:20] Gerard Donnelly: Yeah, so there's a couple waiting to be interviewed.
[00:10:24] Gerard Donnelly: Okay.
[00:10:25] Gerard Donnelly: Yeah.
[00:10:26] Abby Jorgensen: I was also thinking, there's an April 19th half marathon here in town.
[00:10:33] Abby Jorgensen: It coincides with the Drake Relays, which is a big track and field event.
[00:10:39] Abby Jorgensen: On the 19th, would that fit in everything?
[00:10:45] Abby Jorgensen: Put it in.
[00:10:46] Abby Jorgensen: Okay.
[00:10:47] Gerard Donnelly: So I have no phone.
[00:10:49] Gerard Donnelly: Where is that one?
[00:10:49] Gerard Donnelly: Local?
[00:10:51] Gerard Donnelly: Like a mile from my house.
[00:10:52] Abby Jorgensen: Yeah.
[00:10:52] Abby Jorgensen: Yeah.
[00:10:53] Abby Jorgensen: I could walk up, run to the, yeah.
[00:10:57] Abby Jorgensen: I just found ruined.
[00:11:00] Abby Jorgensen: Yeah, D-E-S and then Moines, Des Moines is how, in French, it's I instead of Y.
[00:11:12] Abby Jorgensen: There we go.
[00:11:17] Gerard Donnelly: Yeah, we'll just keep putting stuff in and then we can work out whether that's what we want to do.
[00:11:22] Abby Jorgensen: Okay, I just don't know if there's enough recovery time between that and I'm sure that we'll be fine.
[00:11:29] Abby Jorgensen: And where's the marathon date?
[00:11:31] Gerard Donnelly: That's October, so that's 30.
[00:11:36] Gerard Donnelly: Yeah.
[00:11:39] Gerard Donnelly: Have you got that in?
[00:11:40] Gerard Donnelly: I don't know if I do or not.
[00:11:43] Abby Jorgensen: What date is it?
[00:11:45] Gerard Donnelly: October.
[00:11:46] Abby Jorgensen: I was just looking at paying for all this stuff because the prices go up after the first.
[00:11:53] Abby Jorgensen: So I was trying to see what everything was going to cost me.
[00:12:11] Abby Jorgensen: October 19th, oh wait, that was 2025, that's probably whatever, the Sunday is the 18th, yeah, that's what it'll be then.
[00:12:23] Abby Jorgensen: Great.
[00:12:31] Gerard Donnelly: Did you say the 1st of January the prices go up?
[00:12:36] Abby Jorgensen: Yeah, I mean, I'll pay for the two marathons for sure, and then the 70.3.
[00:12:43] Abby Jorgensen: I'm waiting to hear back, Ironman doesn't make it very easy, I don't have the same email that I was using, like, with my CrossFit gym, I was using for Ironman, and you have to email them, and they don't really respond back, so.
[00:13:00] Abby Jorgensen: Hmm.
[00:13:00] Gerard Donnelly: OK.
[00:13:01] Gerard Donnelly: I don't know.
[00:13:02] Abby Jorgensen: I'll just register and won't get an email, I guess.
[00:13:08] Gerard Donnelly: There must be a way.
[00:13:09] Gerard Donnelly: Yeah, I was looking for a number and everything.
[00:13:12] Abby Jorgensen: You can put in a request online, but I put in one in November and it still says it hasn't been like done.
[00:13:19] Abby Jorgensen: So I was like, well, that's hopeless.
[00:13:22] Abby Jorgensen: Like, yeah, I was like, this isn't going to work.
[00:13:24] Abby Jorgensen: Like, and every email they gave you, it sent back that it was non-deliverable.
[00:13:30] Abby Jorgensen: So I don't know.
[00:13:32] Abby Jorgensen: There's no phone number to contact us.
[00:13:34] Abby Jorgensen: No, I was looking all over the website to look for a number and there was nothing.
[00:13:40] Gerard Donnelly: Try the email again, Abby.
[00:13:42] Gerard Donnelly: Yeah.
[00:13:45] Abby Jorgensen: All right, we better get into it.
[00:13:46] Abby Jorgensen: Yeah.
[00:13:48] Abby Jorgensen: Shouldn't be a whole lot this week with.
[00:13:51] Abby Jorgensen: Anybody.
[00:13:53] Gerard Donnelly: Let me get John's out.
[00:13:55] Gerard Donnelly: Yeah.
[00:13:56] Gerard Donnelly: Did he email?
[00:13:57] Abby Jorgensen: He texted me.
[00:13:58] Gerard Donnelly: OK.
[00:14:00] Gerard Donnelly: It was all praise.
[00:14:02] Gerard Donnelly: It was great.
[00:14:04] Gerard Donnelly: It was great, but it's frustrating.
[00:14:06] Gerard Donnelly: Yeah, for sure.
[00:14:08] Gerard Donnelly: That's kind of not what I interviewed him.
[00:14:10] Abby Jorgensen: Yeah.
[00:14:13] Gerard Donnelly: Good kid, but yeah.
[00:14:16] Gerard Donnelly: How's Coco going?
[00:14:18] Gerard Donnelly: I think she went better this week.
[00:14:20] Abby Jorgensen: She seemed like it.
[00:14:22] Abby Jorgensen: She did a race-ready session this weekend.
[00:14:27] Abby Jorgensen: It didn't look too bad.
[00:14:28] Abby Jorgensen: Yeah.
[00:14:31] Abby Jorgensen: She did tend to just...
[00:14:33] Abby Jorgensen: She did a lot more swimming, which I know isn't too hard on the body, but overall fatigue will...
[00:14:40] Abby Jorgensen: Yeah.
[00:14:41] Abby Jorgensen: We're almost to a deload week for her.
[00:14:44] Abby Jorgensen: Yeah.
[00:14:46] Gerard Donnelly: Yeah, but just because she's, you know, got all this training time, she has to have that recovery.
[00:14:55] Gerard Donnelly: For her recovery week...
[00:14:57] Abby Jorgensen: For her recovery week...
[00:14:58] Abby Jorgensen: week...
[00:15:00] Abby Jorgensen: Um, what should we be testing at this stage?
[00:15:04] Abby Jorgensen: Because then she leaves again to go back home and then that can't.
[00:15:11] Gerard Donnelly: I would, if she's running with no injuries, I'd be giving her a 10K run.
[00:15:16] Gerard Donnelly: Okay.
[00:15:17] Gerard Donnelly: And I'd give her a 20 minute FTP and I'd also give her a 60 minute.
[00:15:23] Gerard Donnelly: Both?
[00:15:24] Gerard Donnelly: Okay.
[00:15:28] Gerard Donnelly: Just so you can show her, when she multiplies the 20 minute 95% and then tries to do it for 60 minutes, she won't be able to do it.
[00:15:40] Gerard Donnelly: Um, there are a few exceptions that people can do it, but not many.
[00:15:47] Gerard Donnelly: Yeah, so 1K swim, 20 minute FTP and the, you know, make sure that Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, you've got to say, well, we need recovery and it's okay to go easy running.
[00:16:00] Gerard Donnelly: Easy riding, but no intensity, no hills, just stay on the flat, just spin the legs out.
[00:16:11] Gerard Donnelly: Okay.
[00:16:14] Gerard Donnelly: So, you know, you just do some easy, is she having to swim in the open water, Abby?
[00:16:20] Gerard Donnelly: Is it warm enough?
[00:16:21] Abby Jorgensen: Well, I don't know, I'll ask her, know she, there's a nice pool there.
[00:16:26] Gerard Donnelly: Yeah, well, just tell her, just to, you know, keep the swimming easy.
[00:16:31] Gerard Donnelly: In that recovery week, it's all about absorbing the training load, three-week block, and allowing yourself to, you know, the testing stuff.
[00:16:43] Gerard Donnelly: You've got to make sure that she understands the value of this testing.
[00:16:46] Gerard Donnelly: It's just to make sure that we're getting practice at executing, at where you think your form is.
[00:16:52] Gerard Donnelly: And it's a great training session with intensity, but it's a really good tool to use for...
[00:16:59] Gerard Donnelly: ...
[00:16:59] Gerard Donnelly: ...
[00:17:00] Gerard Donnelly: Our next block to make sure we're training accurately.
[00:17:07] Gerard Donnelly: Okay.
[00:17:08] Abby Jorgensen: Would you do 20-minute Thursday and then 60 on Saturday?
[00:17:12] Abby Jorgensen: That's right, yeah.
[00:17:14] Gerard Donnelly: Or you could do the 60 on Sunday and do 10K on Saturday.
[00:17:17] Gerard Donnelly: That's what I would do.
[00:17:18] Gerard Donnelly: Okay.
[00:17:19] Gerard Donnelly: 10K run on Saturday and 60-minute on Sunday or vice versa.
[00:17:24] Gerard Donnelly: It doesn't matter.
[00:17:29] Gerard Donnelly: Probably better, Abby, to keep it at Saturday, bike, Sunday, 10K.
[00:17:34] Gerard Donnelly: Okay.
[00:17:35] Gerard Donnelly: And ask her if there's any races around while she's there.
[00:17:44] Abby Jorgensen: All right.
[00:17:45] Abby Jorgensen: Okay.
[00:17:48] Gerard Donnelly: Jiggy?
[00:17:49] Abby Jorgensen: Well, I had a talk with him, so he has – he has another high – he says he's just been crazy with the holidays.
[00:17:57] Abby Jorgensen: He said this week will probably be the same.
[00:18:00] Abby Jorgensen: Same.
[00:18:00] Abby Jorgensen: And then next week, he should be done with whatever obligations he has.
[00:18:07] Abby Jorgensen: But he has another High Rocks in four weeks.
[00:18:10] Abby Jorgensen: Yep.
[00:18:11] Abby Jorgensen: Right there.
[00:18:11] Abby Jorgensen: That one's a singles event.
[00:18:13] Abby Jorgensen: Yep.
[00:18:14] Abby Jorgensen: He's done all the doubles.
[00:18:18] Abby Jorgensen: But he's like, I know the value of Triathlon plus High Rocks are going to do well together.
[00:18:23] Abby Jorgensen: So he knows it.
[00:18:25] Abby Jorgensen: And we've had that talk.
[00:18:26] Abby Jorgensen: So it's just a matter of getting him back.
[00:18:27] Abby Jorgensen: Yep.
[00:18:29] Abby Jorgensen: I don't see him doing any training.
[00:18:32] Gerard Donnelly: He's still doing stuff, but I was like, why didn't it load into...
[00:18:36] Abby Jorgensen: Yep.
[00:18:38] Abby Jorgensen: But...
[00:18:39] Abby Jorgensen: Yep.
[00:18:41] Gerard Donnelly: He's got, like, the cardio loads, so why isn't any other thing...
[00:18:44] Gerard Donnelly: Like, how the hell is he competing when he's not training?
[00:18:48] Gerard Donnelly: Yeah.
[00:18:50] Gerard Donnelly: Anyway.
[00:18:52] Abby Jorgensen: Andrew?
[00:18:54] Gerard Donnelly: He's doing well.
[00:18:55] Abby Jorgensen: Um, we have one more, one more week, and then...
[00:19:00] Abby Jorgensen: we're going to test and then we're going to go back to like a full like a full week.
[00:19:06] Abby Jorgensen: He wanted to want to see.
[00:19:09] Abby Jorgensen: So his main goals this next year is he wants to PR his half marathon at the Indy the Indy Marathon.
[00:19:17] Abby Jorgensen: So I have that up above and then PR Muncie.
[00:19:24] Abby Jorgensen: Yes.
[00:19:25] Abby Jorgensen: So I don't know if up until May, if we go more of a kind of like a running block.
[00:19:33] Gerard Donnelly: Yeah.
[00:19:37] Gerard Donnelly: Yeah.
[00:19:38] Abby Jorgensen: OK.
[00:19:40] Gerard Donnelly: Would he say that the half marathon is more important than the marathon?
[00:19:45] Gerard Donnelly: I mean, I mean, both of those are like his main goal.
[00:19:50] Abby Jorgensen: OK.
[00:19:51] Abby Jorgensen: But I feel like the way Muncie, I mean, you don't know what the weather is going to be like this year.
[00:19:55] Abby Jorgensen: But remember, that was the race that was just so hot that people.
[00:20:00] Abby Jorgensen: We're walking most of it.
[00:20:03] Abby Jorgensen: So, yeah, I feel like just assuming the temperature doesn't get, you know, he should be in better running shape and better.
[00:20:14] Abby Jorgensen: Yeah, I'd give him a similar program to yours.
[00:20:17] Gerard Donnelly: Okay.
[00:20:19] Gerard Donnelly: He still needs the ride and run session and the one swim.
[00:20:24] Gerard Donnelly: Two bikes at least or?
[00:20:26] Abby Jorgensen: Two bikes minimum.
[00:20:28] Gerard Donnelly: Two bikes minimum.
[00:20:30] Gerard Donnelly: Yeah.
[00:20:31] Gerard Donnelly: Has he had many injuries, Andrew?
[00:20:33] Gerard Donnelly: Running injuries?
[00:20:34] Abby Jorgensen: No.
[00:20:35] Abby Jorgensen: Good.
[00:20:35] Abby Jorgensen: We want to increase his running load for sure.
[00:20:40] Gerard Donnelly: So I'd almost copy your program, Abby, for him.
[00:20:46] Gerard Donnelly: Get him swimming.
[00:20:47] Gerard Donnelly: Get him.
[00:20:49] Gerard Donnelly: If you think he's running, up for it.
[00:20:51] Gerard Donnelly: What are we averaging?
[00:20:55] Gerard Donnelly: 15, 17.
[00:20:56] Gerard Donnelly: know.
[00:20:56] Gerard Donnelly: see time.
[00:20:56] Gerard Donnelly: don't dead I'm at I How are paying for days Damn.
[00:20:59] Gerard Donnelly: There's a
[00:21:00] Gerard Donnelly: He didn't run much, has he?
[00:21:02] Gerard Donnelly: 18.
[00:21:02] Gerard Donnelly: Two a week for now.
[00:21:05] Abby Jorgensen: He's averaging 18 to 20.
[00:21:07] Abby Jorgensen: How many miles for a half marathon would you try to average?
[00:21:13] Gerard Donnelly: Yeah, it has to be between 40 and 60 for a half.
[00:21:17] Gerard Donnelly: Did you say it's doing a half or a marathon?
[00:21:20] Gerard Donnelly: It's a half.
[00:21:22] Gerard Donnelly: It's not a full marathon?
[00:21:23] Gerard Donnelly: No, it's just a half marathon.
[00:21:26] Abby Jorgensen: Ah.
[00:21:29] Gerard Donnelly: I got that wrong.
[00:21:30] Gerard Donnelly: Sorry, I thought I just saw a marathon.
[00:21:33] Gerard Donnelly: Yeah.
[00:21:34] Gerard Donnelly: So yeah, okay.
[00:21:36] Gerard Donnelly: Take that back.
[00:21:38] Gerard Donnelly: I would give him the standard triathlon program for that half marathon.
[00:21:42] Gerard Donnelly: Okay.
[00:21:44] Gerard Donnelly: So keep his two rides up during the week, and he's one ride on the weekend, and do his normal Tuesday, Thursday run, Saturday run off the bike, Sunday long run.
[00:21:57] Gerard Donnelly: Okay.
[00:21:59] Abby Jorgensen: Thank
[00:22:00] Gerard Donnelly: And if you wanted to give him another run, you could just do something easy on the Wednesday, but that could either be a ride or a run.
[00:22:11] Gerard Donnelly: Okay?
[00:22:12] Abby Jorgensen: Okay.
[00:22:16] Gerard Donnelly: So we could have three runs, Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday, and then two runs, Saturday, Sunday, so five runs.
[00:22:30] Gerard Donnelly: And maybe one of the rides is a bit more sub-threshold, Zone 2, and the other one's VO2.
[00:22:38] Gerard Donnelly: Okay.
[00:22:39] Gerard Donnelly: Right?
[00:22:40] Abby Jorgensen: Yep.
[00:22:42] Abby Jorgensen: Okay.
[00:22:43] Gerard Donnelly: How's Sin going?
[00:22:47] Abby Jorgensen: Yeah, I mean, he's doing what he can for where he's at, so.
[00:22:51] Abby Jorgensen: I'm scared, yep.
[00:22:53] Abby Jorgensen: Yeah.
[00:22:56] Abby Jorgensen: So hopefully once he gets back on the third.
[00:23:00] Abby Jorgensen: Just get back to normalcy.
[00:23:02] Abby Jorgensen: Good.
[00:23:03] Abby Jorgensen: Chris?
[00:23:05] Abby Jorgensen: He's good as well.
[00:23:06] Abby Jorgensen: So we, last week, we're just kind of used as a, like a bridge week because he wasn't able to do true bike intensity or anything.
[00:23:15] Abby Jorgensen: That's okay.
[00:23:16] Abby Jorgensen: Yep.
[00:23:18] Abby Jorgensen: So this week, we're back to like an actual week three.
[00:23:23] Abby Jorgensen: Yeah, good.
[00:23:24] Abby Jorgensen: Yep.
[00:23:25] Abby Jorgensen: And he's got a half marathon, you said, in January?
[00:23:28] Gerard Donnelly: Yeah.
[00:23:30] Gerard Donnelly: Yep.
[00:23:33] Gerard Donnelly: Has his running day gone?
[00:23:37] Abby Jorgensen: Yeah, 15, 16.
[00:23:39] Abby Jorgensen: We try not to run.
[00:23:41] Abby Jorgensen: He doesn't like back-to-back runs because of a previous injury.
[00:23:45] Abby Jorgensen: So right now, we're just, yeah, the three runs.
[00:23:50] Abby Jorgensen: Yep.
[00:23:51] Abby Jorgensen: Right now.
[00:23:57] Gerard Donnelly: Thank you, on.
[00:23:59] Gerard Donnelly: Go on.
[00:23:59] Gerard Donnelly: You
[00:24:10] Gerard Donnelly: Hmm, every, 70 minutes that week.
[00:24:18] Gerard Donnelly: Yep.
[00:24:21] Gerard Donnelly: He didn't get a long run that week did he?
[00:24:28] Gerard Donnelly: Yep.
[00:24:30] Gerard Donnelly: All right, we just got to make sure he doesn't miss the long run.
[00:24:34] Gerard Donnelly: Yeah, he should be okay now that he's back home.
[00:24:40] Gerard Donnelly: Yep, okay.
[00:24:46] Gerard Donnelly: Testing week.
[00:24:47] Gerard Donnelly: Yep.
[00:24:56] Gerard Donnelly: January the 18th, half marathon.
[00:25:00] Abby Jorgensen: Yeah, he already had that, like, scheduled before he interviewed with us.
[00:25:05] Abby Jorgensen: So I think it's just one of those things he already had on the book.
[00:25:11] Abby Jorgensen: That's okay.
[00:25:14] Gerard Donnelly: All right.
[00:25:15] Gerard Donnelly: Kevin?
[00:25:19] Abby Jorgensen: He's doing good.
[00:25:20] Abby Jorgensen: I had a talk with him about his cadence today.
[00:25:22] Abby Jorgensen: And then he's hoping to – his physio is back in the office today and talk to him about upping his running a little bit because it's feeling pretty good.
[00:25:34] Abby Jorgensen: Yep.
[00:25:36] Abby Jorgensen: He hits his numbers, but his cadence was really low.
[00:25:42] Gerard Donnelly: What's his range?
[00:25:43] Gerard Donnelly: He's 360.
[00:25:52] Gerard Donnelly: He's a bit low, isn't he, on the power?
[00:25:54] Gerard Donnelly: I don't – I – When I was – It's the –
[00:26:06] Gerard Donnelly: Maybe it's just that set, is it?
[00:26:09] Abby Jorgensen: Yeah, mean, I was looking at the first couple of sets before I messaged him because his cadence was low.
[00:26:14] Abby Jorgensen: He really wasn't above the range.
[00:26:19] Gerard Donnelly: 344.
[00:26:21] Gerard Donnelly: Why is that different?
[00:26:22] Gerard Donnelly: If I change something wrong, have 359, 344, 344.
[00:26:28] Gerard Donnelly: What have I done wrong there?
[00:26:30] Gerard Donnelly: That's not making sense.
[00:26:31] Gerard Donnelly: In the workout?
[00:26:32] Abby Jorgensen: Oh, that one's lower.
[00:26:35] Gerard Donnelly: There's no way I would, why would I put 125%?
[00:26:40] Gerard Donnelly: Jesus, how does that happen?
[00:26:45] Gerard Donnelly: That's so weird.
[00:26:54] Gerard Donnelly: No, 120.
[00:26:56] Gerard Donnelly: That was a change in itself.
[00:27:00] Gerard Donnelly: So that's all right.
[00:27:02] Gerard Donnelly: Wonder if that's on, wonder if that's on anybody else's.
[00:27:07] Abby Jorgensen: What week is it, two?
[00:27:10] Abby Jorgensen: Two.
[00:27:15] Gerard Donnelly: No.
[00:27:21] Abby Jorgensen: No.
[00:27:22] Gerard Donnelly: No.
[00:27:24] Gerard Donnelly: 120?
[00:27:25] Gerard Donnelly: 120?
[00:27:28] Gerard Donnelly: Oof.
[00:27:29] Abby Jorgensen: Weird.
[00:27:36] Gerard Donnelly: So, yep, just keep building his walk run, run.
[00:27:43] Gerard Donnelly: Mm-hmm.
[00:27:43] Gerard Donnelly: It's basically just an incline run.
[00:27:46] Abby Jorgensen: Did you ever ask your...
[00:27:47] Abby Jorgensen: No, I didn't get to speak about it.
[00:27:51] Gerard Donnelly: I'll ask Matt.
[00:27:52] Gerard Donnelly: ask...
[00:27:55] Gerard Donnelly: I'm gonna get to, go.
[00:27:57] Gerard Donnelly: I'm gonna get I'll I'll you.
[00:28:03] Gerard Donnelly: Okay.
[00:28:04] Gerard Donnelly: Richard?
[00:28:06] Abby Jorgensen: He should be testing this week when he gets back.
[00:28:10] Abby Jorgensen: He's been in Austin.
[00:28:12] Abby Jorgensen: gets back.
[00:28:13] Abby Jorgensen: Yep.
[00:28:13] Abby Jorgensen: Has he been trying again?
[00:28:15] Abby Jorgensen: Yeah.
[00:28:16] Abby Jorgensen: Yeah, we were up in his run and he's finally able to run without any niggles or anything like that.
[00:28:23] Abby Jorgensen: So good.
[00:28:26] Abby Jorgensen: His only goals are usually Olympic distance as a max.
[00:28:29] Abby Jorgensen: So you shouldn't.
[00:28:31] Abby Jorgensen: That's right.
[00:28:33] Abby Jorgensen: Good.
[00:28:33] Abby Jorgensen: Mikayla?
[00:28:36] Abby Jorgensen: She so she got her TT bike, but of course they ordered the wrong power meter.
[00:28:41] Abby Jorgensen: So they gave her a loaner power meter that's not working.
[00:28:47] Abby Jorgensen: So we're going to, it should be, they said it should arrive like soon, but they're not going to be in shop until after the new year.
[00:28:55] Abby Jorgensen: So he's going to do her like her regular bike.
[00:28:59] Abby Jorgensen: her going
[00:29:00] Abby Jorgensen: I on the trainer with her road bike, and then I have her getting outside on the TT bike because she says it's a lot different.
[00:29:09] Abby Jorgensen: I was like, yeah, the TT bike is a lot different than a road bike, so she's getting used to.
[00:29:15] Abby Jorgensen: She had a bike fit, Abby?
[00:29:17] Gerard Donnelly: Yeah, she had the bike fit a couple weeks ago or whatever.
[00:29:21] Abby Jorgensen: Yep.
[00:29:22] Abby Jorgensen: I should tell you.
[00:29:23] Abby Jorgensen: Yeah.
[00:29:24] Abby Jorgensen: She says it's a smaller crank, too, so she's not used to that.
[00:29:30] Abby Jorgensen: Is she comfortable?
[00:29:31] Abby Jorgensen: Do what?
[00:29:32] Abby Jorgensen: Is she comfortable?
[00:29:34] Abby Jorgensen: Yeah, she says she's, well, besides the TT position, she's not used to.
[00:29:38] Abby Jorgensen: She said her shoulders got sore.
[00:29:40] Abby Jorgensen: I'm like, yeah, if you're not used to all that stuff, it is a little bit scary.
[00:29:53] Gerard Donnelly: She's having trouble staying in the aero position?
[00:29:56] Gerard Donnelly: Yeah, I think that's a strength thing.
[00:30:00] Gerard Donnelly: I would say to her, look, if you keep riding and it's uncomfortable, get them to move the bars out, you know.
[00:30:08] Gerard Donnelly: Okay.
[00:30:21] Gerard Donnelly: Yep, okay.
[00:30:25] Gerard Donnelly: All right, well, she just needs to get out there and ride as much as she can and tell her not worry about staying in the TT position.
[00:30:32] Gerard Donnelly: Just do it as intervals, you know.
[00:30:35] Gerard Donnelly: Okay.
[00:30:37] Gerard Donnelly: You know, be down there for five minutes, give yourself 10-second rest, go back, you know.
[00:30:43] Gerard Donnelly: Just keep doing chunks of it so that if you find that it's not improving, if it's too tight and painful, the fit's wrong, you know, but you've got to give it a chance.
[00:30:57] Abby Jorgensen: It's a new, completely foreign position.
[00:31:00] Gerard Donnelly: Yeah, I find it easier outside than inside, so.
[00:31:04] Abby Jorgensen: Yeah, yeah, I think I do too.
[00:31:07] Abby Jorgensen: Just, you can move around a little bit more, so.
[00:31:10] Abby Jorgensen: All right, you got her under control, Blair?
[00:31:12] Abby Jorgensen: Blair, he's out on a ski trip, so.
[00:31:16] Abby Jorgensen: Yes, okay.
[00:31:17] Abby Jorgensen: So, yeah.
[00:31:19] Gerard Donnelly: So does he say, that's just, don't worry about training?
[00:31:22] Gerard Donnelly: Yeah, he's like, I just will be skiing so much that.
[00:31:25] Abby Jorgensen: Yep.
[00:31:27] Abby Jorgensen: Understandable.
[00:31:28] Abby Jorgensen: Yep, okay.
[00:31:30] Gerard Donnelly: Um, Pemberton?
[00:31:33] Abby Jorgensen: She's good as well.
[00:31:37] Abby Jorgensen: She, she's been training pretty good on vacation, so.
[00:31:40] Abby Jorgensen: Yep.
[00:31:41] Gerard Donnelly: She's, she's a doer, isn't she?
[00:31:44] Abby Jorgensen: She, she even, like, she's been, been having some, like, technical difficulties, but what was happening is, like, the trainer, her, her power meters and, and then, like, the, the Wahoo were conflicting, and she didn't know.
[00:32:00] Abby Jorgensen: I which one she was looking at, but she finally figured it out, and then she asked ChatGPT to, like, do something, and she figured out what was wrong.
[00:32:10] Abby Jorgensen: So I don't know.
[00:32:13] Abby Jorgensen: I'm like, all right, well.
[00:32:15] Abby Jorgensen: Oh, my God, her cadence is so high.
[00:32:17] Gerard Donnelly: I know.
[00:32:18] Gerard Donnelly: don't.
[00:32:19] Gerard Donnelly: Her cadence is always.
[00:32:20] Gerard Donnelly: Yeah, get her to drop that down.
[00:32:23] Gerard Donnelly: We don't want to do on that.
[00:32:27] Gerard Donnelly: Yeah, make a big thing of that, Abby.
[00:32:30] Gerard Donnelly: Get her cadence down.
[00:32:32] Gerard Donnelly: Okay.
[00:32:32] Gerard Donnelly: don't want it over 100.
[00:32:35] Gerard Donnelly: That's very unusual.
[00:32:37] Gerard Donnelly: We'd be saying stuff like that.
[00:32:39] Gerard Donnelly: More like 95.
[00:32:42] Gerard Donnelly: Well, I'm all the time trying to get people to write above 80.
[00:32:46] Gerard Donnelly: Yeah.
[00:32:49] Gerard Donnelly: So she's doing this well, so she can do it.
[00:32:52] Gerard Donnelly: Mm-hmm.
[00:32:56] Abby Jorgensen: Maybe she's just picked the wrong gear, and she's...
[00:32:59] Abby Jorgensen: Yeah, cab sontirona.
[00:33:00] Gerard Donnelly: Tell her it's great to spin but that's too much.
[00:33:05] Gerard Donnelly: Okay.
[00:33:06] Gerard Donnelly: Yeah.
[00:33:11] Gerard Donnelly: She's just nailing it.
[00:33:18] Gerard Donnelly: Fantastic.
[00:33:19] Gerard Donnelly: That's great.
[00:33:19] Gerard Donnelly: 87.
[00:33:20] Gerard Donnelly: That's great.
[00:33:21] Abby Jorgensen: Really good.
[00:33:23] Abby Jorgensen: Happy with that.
[00:33:25] Gerard Donnelly: Her knee's bothering her again.
[00:33:27] Gerard Donnelly: Yeah.
[00:33:28] Abby Jorgensen: then she ran, well she, yeah, ran that this day and it felt better.
[00:33:36] Abby Jorgensen: Yep.
[00:33:37] Abby Jorgensen: So.
[00:33:38] Abby Jorgensen: Yep.
[00:33:39] Abby Jorgensen: Good.
[00:33:40] Gerard Donnelly: Okay.
[00:33:42] Abby Jorgensen: So we'll keep an eye on it but I don't know.
[00:33:48] Abby Jorgensen: She says it doesn't bother when she's biking or anything so I don't know what.
[00:33:53] Abby Jorgensen: Yeah.
[00:33:57] Gerard Donnelly: Shoes.
[00:33:58] Gerard Donnelly: I mean I can check.
[00:34:00] Abby Jorgensen: But I mean, that was her issue when she started that she's always gets a knee pain.
[00:34:07] Abby Jorgensen: So it's from all her years of jujitsu.
[00:34:11] Abby Jorgensen: Yes.
[00:34:11] Gerard Donnelly: Yeah.
[00:34:12] Gerard Donnelly: Well, I the knees can get cranked on in jujitsu.
[00:34:15] Abby Jorgensen: know that.
[00:34:16] Abby Jorgensen: But.
[00:34:18] Abby Jorgensen: Yeah, I think just Talloway's got to keep progressing the running.
[00:34:22] Abby Jorgensen: Yeah.
[00:34:24] Gerard Donnelly: All right.
[00:34:25] Gerard Donnelly: Wayne.
[00:34:27] Gerard Donnelly: I mean, he's done some things here and there.
[00:34:29] Abby Jorgensen: He did give me all his goals.
[00:34:31] Abby Jorgensen: They went on a little, little trip.
[00:34:34] Abby Jorgensen: Yeah.
[00:34:35] Abby Jorgensen: Good.
[00:34:41] Abby Jorgensen: That's great.
[00:34:43] Abby Jorgensen: So, yeah.
[00:34:46] Abby Jorgensen: So, March.
[00:34:51] Gerard Donnelly: Where's Henquin?
[00:34:52] Gerard Donnelly: I have no idea.
[00:34:54] Abby Jorgensen: I think it's within like driving or like some place he.
[00:35:00] Abby Jorgensen: He talked about they can drive.
[00:35:01] Abby Jorgensen: It's like a long drive, but I don't know.
[00:35:07] Gerard Donnelly: All right.
[00:35:07] Gerard Donnelly: Mario?
[00:35:10] Abby Jorgensen: He's picking up his power pedals today, but really consistent the last couple of weeks.
[00:35:17] Abby Jorgensen: So that's good for him.
[00:35:21] Gerard Donnelly: It'd be pleasing if he can actually get the power meter going.
[00:35:25] Gerard Donnelly: Yeah.
[00:35:26] Abby Jorgensen: He's actually training well, isn't he?
[00:35:28] Gerard Donnelly: Yeah.
[00:35:29] Abby Jorgensen: Like he's been, his swimming, he's still struggling with swimming.
[00:35:32] Abby Jorgensen: So I'm going to, you know, try to really get him to find somebody or, you know, contact.
[00:35:38] Abby Jorgensen: Yeah.
[00:35:41] Abby Jorgensen: He says he can't finish a session without using like a, like a swim belt or a buoy.
[00:35:48] Abby Jorgensen: Yeah.
[00:35:49] Abby Jorgensen: Or whatever.
[00:35:50] Abby Jorgensen: So it's obviously his body position, but.
[00:35:52] Abby Jorgensen: Yeah.
[00:35:55] Gerard Donnelly: Yeah.
[00:35:56] Gerard Donnelly: Okay.
[00:35:57] Gerard Donnelly: Yeah.
[00:35:59] Gerard Donnelly: So.
[00:35:59] Gerard Donnelly: So.
[00:36:00] Gerard Donnelly: Will he have the new power meter?
[00:36:03] Gerard Donnelly: He should.
[00:36:04] Abby Jorgensen: He's supposed to pick him up today.
[00:36:07] Gerard Donnelly: So he's got to make sure, even if he, tell him to have a little 10-minute practice session on Tuesday to make sure it's working so that when he gets to Wednesday, he's not spending the whole day.
[00:36:20] Gerard Donnelly: And so by the time he gets to Thursday, we've got it sorted.
[00:36:23] Gerard Donnelly: And if it doesn't, be prepared to move it.
[00:36:27] Gerard Donnelly: Yeah.
[00:36:29] Abby Jorgensen: Yeah.
[00:36:30] Gerard Donnelly: That's good, Abby.
[00:36:31] Gerard Donnelly: Good stuff.
[00:36:32] Gerard Donnelly: Mark Kroll?
[00:36:33] Gerard Donnelly: I just talked to him.
[00:36:36] Abby Jorgensen: He's going to the doctor tomorrow.
[00:36:42] Abby Jorgensen: What's going on?
[00:36:43] Gerard Donnelly: He's been sick, is he?
[00:36:45] Abby Jorgensen: His knee has been bothering, with the running.
[00:36:47] Abby Jorgensen: I know he went out of town for Christmas and had a whole bunch of holiday stuff.
[00:36:53] Abby Jorgensen: But we think it's, we both think it's patellar tendonitis or like Gunner's knee.
[00:36:59] Abby Jorgensen: So he's going
[00:37:00] Abby Jorgensen: Go get it checked out just to make sure.
[00:37:02] Abby Jorgensen: Yep.
[00:37:03] Abby Jorgensen: He says it doesn't, like, it'll hurt after a run.
[00:37:06] Abby Jorgensen: Yeah, okay.
[00:37:07] Abby Jorgensen: And he doesn't get any worse.
[00:37:09] Abby Jorgensen: Has he been training well enough to test?
[00:37:12] Gerard Donnelly: You happy with?
[00:37:13] Gerard Donnelly: Yeah, up until last week with Christmas.
[00:37:16] Gerard Donnelly: Should we, I'm probably too late, but should we just do another week before your test?
[00:37:22] Gerard Donnelly: Because he had that whole week off.
[00:37:24] Abby Jorgensen: I mean, I can check with him and see what, I just talk to him and see what he would prefer.
[00:37:28] Abby Jorgensen: I know he's, oh, I think it's 19 weeks till Chattanooga, so.
[00:37:33] Gerard Donnelly: Yeah, Chattanooga Olympic, yep.
[00:37:38] Gerard Donnelly: 2.3.
[00:37:39] Abby Jorgensen: Yeah.
[00:37:40] Gerard Donnelly: I would maybe leave as you've done it, but move the, move the testing to next week and just give another training week.
[00:37:52] Gerard Donnelly: Okay.
[00:37:54] Gerard Donnelly: Because you didn't do that session and you didn't run, so.
[00:37:59] Gerard Donnelly: You really, know.
[00:37:59] Gerard Donnelly: You're
[00:38:00] Gerard Donnelly: Last week he only rode once.
[00:38:04] Gerard Donnelly: Yeah, and he's missing a fair few runs.
[00:38:13] Gerard Donnelly: So he's done, you know, 11k.
[00:38:17] Gerard Donnelly: That's great, 37.
[00:38:20] Gerard Donnelly: Yeah, he's fine up until...
[00:38:22] Gerard Donnelly: Yeah, I think extend his week out a bit more.
[00:38:26] Gerard Donnelly: Okay.
[00:38:29] Abby Jorgensen: Philippe.
[00:38:30] Gerard Donnelly: He does everything I ask of him.
[00:38:33] Abby Jorgensen: Yeah, he's unreal.
[00:38:34] Abby Jorgensen: Yeah, and plus his...
[00:38:36] Abby Jorgensen: I don't know how he skis all that, and then...
[00:38:38] Abby Jorgensen: I know.
[00:38:39] Gerard Donnelly: How are you doing that?
[00:38:40] Gerard Donnelly: Comes back, and...
[00:38:42] Abby Jorgensen: I asked him, I'm like, I asked him how he...
[00:38:45] Abby Jorgensen: I mean, it's testing week this week, but...
[00:38:48] Abby Jorgensen: You I made sure he wasn't too fatigued on a Monday, and he said everything felt fine, so...
[00:38:54] Abby Jorgensen: Yeah, great.
[00:38:55] Abby Jorgensen: That's good.
[00:38:56] Gerard Donnelly: Well, more of him, please.
[00:38:59] Abby Jorgensen: Yeah, right?
[00:38:59] Abby Jorgensen: you.
[00:38:59] Abby Jorgensen: Thank
[00:39:01] Gerard Donnelly: How's Erin going?
[00:39:04] Abby Jorgensen: Yeah, mean, for, she's doing pretty good considering, you know, she's done a lot of swimming.
[00:39:10] Abby Jorgensen: Yep.
[00:39:11] Abby Jorgensen: She said she went back to, you know, where she trained in high school.
[00:39:17] Abby Jorgensen: Yep.
[00:39:19] Abby Jorgensen: She's in Sydney.
[00:39:20] Abby Jorgensen: Yeah, so she said she's yet to find a good place with a bike, but she did run today and swam.
[00:39:30] Abby Jorgensen: Swam, yep, and run.
[00:39:31] Gerard Donnelly: Good.
[00:39:32] Abby Jorgensen: So she must, she's probably just getting up now, I'm guessing.
[00:39:36] Abby Jorgensen: I don't know.
[00:39:37] Abby Jorgensen: Yep.
[00:39:38] Gerard Donnelly: Yeah, it's 9.30.
[00:39:39] Gerard Donnelly: Okay.
[00:39:41] Gerard Donnelly: All right.
[00:39:43] Gerard Donnelly: Riley, he's your main man.
[00:39:45] Abby Jorgensen: Yeah, he's, he just texted me too.
[00:39:51] Abby Jorgensen: I think he's driving back to.
[00:39:53] Abby Jorgensen: Yep.
[00:39:54] Abby Jorgensen: So he's in new block.
[00:39:58] Gerard Donnelly: He's done all right.
[00:40:03] Gerard Donnelly: I was a bit worried about his Ironman Texas only being 15 weeks away.
[00:40:10] Gerard Donnelly: Yeah, that's why we added the duration on to.
[00:40:15] Abby Jorgensen: Yeah.
[00:40:17] Abby Jorgensen: Yeah.
[00:40:21] Gerard Donnelly: So he's getting the four rides in and he's getting the four runs in.
[00:40:26] Gerard Donnelly: Good.
[00:40:27] Gerard Donnelly: Great.
[00:40:30] Gerard Donnelly: That'll come around quick.
[00:40:32] Gerard Donnelly: Yeah, that's what I texted him, told him.
[00:40:34] Abby Jorgensen: like, I know it seems like it's a ways away, but when you're in training blocks, the four weeks goes by fast.
[00:40:41] Abby Jorgensen: Yes.
[00:40:43] Gerard Donnelly: Yeah, so he's got to do extra on that Saturday.
[00:40:46] Gerard Donnelly: Yeah.
[00:40:47] Abby Jorgensen: Yep.
[00:40:48] Gerard Donnelly: Peter, is he still traveling?
[00:40:51] Abby Jorgensen: He just got back yesterday.
[00:40:53] Abby Jorgensen: Yep.
[00:40:54] Abby Jorgensen: And we went over.
[00:40:56] Abby Jorgensen: He kind of wanted me to pick a something else.
[00:41:00] Abby Jorgensen: I was like, what race is it?
[00:41:01] Abby Jorgensen: And he's like, why don't you tell me?
[00:41:03] Abby Jorgensen: And I was like, I can't.
[00:41:05] Abby Jorgensen: I was like, well, so, but he wants to do, his big thing is to do a full Ironman, but he wants to, I don't know if you saw this, but you can qualify for Kona at Hawaii.
[00:41:16] Abby Jorgensen: And since he usually places first or second there, or he has, he wants to just use that to qualify for Kona.
[00:41:23] Abby Jorgensen: Great idea.
[00:41:25] Gerard Donnelly: That could interfere with Nice.
[00:41:28] Gerard Donnelly: Oh, that's what I was like.
[00:41:29] Abby Jorgensen: Cause then that, isn't Kona in October?
[00:41:33] Abby Jorgensen: Oh, that'd actually be, that'd actually be all right, Abby.
[00:41:35] Abby Jorgensen: That would be fine.
[00:41:36] Abby Jorgensen: Yeah.
[00:41:37] Gerard Donnelly: That would be fine.
[00:41:38] Gerard Donnelly: Um, that's great.
[00:41:39] Gerard Donnelly: I'm happy with that.
[00:41:40] Gerard Donnelly: Yeah.
[00:41:41] Abby Jorgensen: And then on maybe a July 70.3, or is that too much?
[00:41:44] Gerard Donnelly: Uh, September, May, June, July, August, September.
[00:41:52] Gerard Donnelly: That's good.
[00:41:53] Gerard Donnelly: That's good spacing.
[00:41:53] Gerard Donnelly: Yeah.
[00:41:55] Gerard Donnelly: is this get every man and his dog going to go to 70.3?
[00:42:00] Gerard Donnelly: qualify in May?
[00:42:01] Gerard Donnelly: that what's going to happen?
[00:42:02] Gerard Donnelly: I don't know.
[00:42:03] Gerard Donnelly: What are they doing here?
[00:42:05] Abby Jorgensen: You have to have the money to fly to Ohio and try to qualify.
[00:42:08] Abby Jorgensen: Yeah.
[00:42:10] Gerard Donnelly: So people might not do that because it means if you're going to do two trips to Kona, could cost you 20 grand.
[00:42:18] Gerard Donnelly: Yeah.
[00:42:18] Gerard Donnelly: I mean, if you can afford it, go for it, I guess.
[00:42:20] Abby Jorgensen: But yeah.
[00:42:23] Gerard Donnelly: All right.
[00:42:24] Gerard Donnelly: Well, he's ready to get going.
[00:42:26] Gerard Donnelly: Yeah.
[00:42:26] Gerard Donnelly: I had a talk with him yesterday or Saturday night.
[00:42:29] Abby Jorgensen: Yeah.
[00:42:30] Abby Jorgensen: Whatever night that was.
[00:42:32] Abby Jorgensen: All right.
[00:42:33] Gerard Donnelly: Good.
[00:42:33] Gerard Donnelly: You got him on track.
[00:42:37] Gerard Donnelly: Just remind him of his expectations of his, you know, he hasn't been training that brilliantly.
[00:42:42] Gerard Donnelly: So his numbers are going to be down.
[00:42:44] Gerard Donnelly: That's why we test him, obviously.
[00:42:47] Gerard Donnelly: Yeah.
[00:42:47] Gerard Donnelly: He also, what do you say?
[00:42:48] Abby Jorgensen: He probably choose some Olympics to do, but he said this year, he's not going to want to like, this last year, he wanted to taper and do really well with them.
[00:42:58] Abby Jorgensen: This year, he just wants to train through.
[00:43:00] Abby Jorgensen: And I was like, that's a better idea, because he had so many races that he wanted to perform well at.
[00:43:12] Abby Jorgensen: Yeah, Dan was upset with his FTP test, but I talked him off the ledge.
[00:43:20] Abby Jorgensen: That's a bit worrying, is it?
[00:43:22] Abby Jorgensen: He said his chain dropped, or chain did something, and it just mentally took him out.
[00:43:31] Abby Jorgensen: I mean, he started where we had talked about, and...
[00:43:39] Gerard Donnelly: What did he do last time?
[00:43:42] Abby Jorgensen: Two, or right around 300, maybe?
[00:43:46] Abby Jorgensen: Am I thinking the right?
[00:43:48] Abby Jorgensen: I don't know, I haven't got it up on the screen.
[00:43:51] Gerard Donnelly: Dan, Dan, Dan.
[00:43:55] Abby Jorgensen: I think was right around 302 for his last one.
[00:44:04] Gerard Donnelly: He fighted towards the end, didn't he?
[00:44:07] Gerard Donnelly: Seems like he's training really well.
[00:44:09] Gerard Donnelly: Yeah, he's trained really well.
[00:44:10] Abby Jorgensen: mean, he's dealt with a little running, like, adductor injury.
[00:44:14] Abby Jorgensen: But other than that, his biking has been normal.
[00:44:19] Abby Jorgensen: So he just must have got it in his head.
[00:44:45] Gerard Donnelly: Nothing wrong with those.
[00:44:51] Gerard Donnelly: 166 max out, right?
[00:45:07] Abby Jorgensen: Yeah, mean, it's hard.
[00:45:09] Abby Jorgensen: It's not too abnormal.
[00:45:14] Gerard Donnelly: Should we fight it, don't we?
[00:45:16] Gerard Donnelly: Mm-hmm.
[00:45:20] Abby Jorgensen: I think he mentally got in his head.
[00:45:27] Abby Jorgensen: He's very critical of himself.
[00:45:36] Abby Jorgensen: Oh, that is.
[00:45:40] Gerard Donnelly: Got back on to somewhere else.
[00:45:43] Gerard Donnelly: There.
[00:45:45] Gerard Donnelly: How do you swim?
[00:45:46] Abby Jorgensen: His swim is the best swim he's, like, I want to say, in my head, I want to say three minutes, but I can't remember.
[00:46:01] Abby Jorgensen: Or two minutes since the last, almost a minute, 2154 to 2057, so it's not going well.
[00:46:16] Gerard Donnelly: I wonder whether we should just give him that test again, Abby.
[00:46:25] Gerard Donnelly: Do it again?
[00:46:26] Abby Jorgensen: Yeah.
[00:46:29] Gerard Donnelly: And do it there.
[00:46:32] Gerard Donnelly: Okay.
[00:46:34] Abby Jorgensen: Or do it there.
[00:46:38] Gerard Donnelly: It'd be better to do it there.
[00:46:45] Gerard Donnelly: And just say to him, let's just start low.
[00:46:47] Gerard Donnelly: And we just want you to finish strong.
[00:46:52] Gerard Donnelly: Just make sure everything's...
[00:46:57] Gerard Donnelly: Calibrated, just in in case.
[00:47:00] Gerard Donnelly: And say to him, look, Gerard and I talked, there's no way that all the training you've been doing has been really good.
[00:47:10] Gerard Donnelly: There's something not right here, so start a bit lower if you need to.
[00:47:17] Gerard Donnelly: Make sure you calibrated everything.
[00:47:23] Gerard Donnelly: And you're riding really well, so that's not, you know.
[00:47:35] Abby Jorgensen: Yeah, he sent me a Christmas card, and then I didn't realize both him and his wife work on NASA ships, or the next mission is in February.
[00:47:49] Abby Jorgensen: So he sent me this, like, coin for this NASA flight.
[00:47:56] Abby Jorgensen: So that's kind of cool.
[00:47:59] Abby Jorgensen: Yeah, it was very nice.
[00:48:00] Abby Jorgensen: I was like, I don't even know he, I knew he worked for the government, but I didn't know he worked on spaceships.
[00:48:06] Abby Jorgensen: Yep.
[00:48:07] Gerard Donnelly: So yeah, just say to me, look, don't forget, the FTP is a training session.
[00:48:13] Gerard Donnelly: Just stop making it in your head, you know, and just start at 280 if you want, it's okay.
[00:48:23] Gerard Donnelly: Yeah.
[00:48:24] Gerard Donnelly: And, and we think you're training so well, that number is not a good reflection of your form.
[00:48:31] Gerard Donnelly: So let's just have another training session where we do it again.
[00:48:37] Gerard Donnelly: And we're using it to train to, but it's, it's not a reflection of your fitness a lot of the time, you know.
[00:48:48] Gerard Donnelly: Let's just don't make it the big thing.
[00:48:51] Gerard Donnelly: His program is fine.
[00:48:53] Gerard Donnelly: So running wise, Abby, you're not get, you're getting into a run.
[00:49:00] Gerard Donnelly: Is he just coming back from Niggles, is he?
[00:49:03] Gerard Donnelly: Yeah, he's just coming back from an injury.
[00:49:05] Abby Jorgensen: But he should have Tuesday, Wednesday is his long run day because he can't on the weekend.
[00:49:11] Abby Jorgensen: That's great.
[00:49:12] Abby Jorgensen: Okay.
[00:49:13] Abby Jorgensen: Yeah.
[00:49:15] Gerard Donnelly: All right.
[00:49:16] Gerard Donnelly: Good.
[00:49:19] Gerard Donnelly: Hey, she did a couple things.
[00:49:22] Abby Jorgensen: Oh, my goodness.
[00:49:24] Gerard Donnelly: She went for two runs.
[00:49:26] Gerard Donnelly: Great.
[00:49:26] Gerard Donnelly: And she did three spin classes.
[00:49:28] Abby Jorgensen: So, I mean, I'll take that.
[00:49:30] Abby Jorgensen: Oh, fantastic.
[00:49:31] Gerard Donnelly: We don't have evidence, but she says she's done it.
[00:49:34] Gerard Donnelly: Yeah, I know.
[00:49:37] Abby Jorgensen: Yeah, I know her grandpa went back in the hospital on Boxing Day.
[00:49:42] Abby Jorgensen: So, because that, because Karen or her mom messaged me everything that's happening.
[00:49:48] Abby Jorgensen: So, I don't know how much that's affecting her while she's home too.
[00:49:52] Abby Jorgensen: So, um.
[00:49:55] Gerard Donnelly: Yeah, well, is it affecting your mom?
[00:49:57] Gerard Donnelly: Yeah.
[00:49:58] Abby Jorgensen: Because she's.
[00:49:59] Abby Jorgensen: She's.
[00:50:00] Abby Jorgensen: Taking care of them because her mom broke her hip and then the dad went in, her father went into the hospital, got home, and then went back in the hospital on time.
[00:50:11] Abby Jorgensen: Oh my God.
[00:50:13] Abby Jorgensen: Jesus.
[00:50:15] Abby Jorgensen: Yeah.
[00:50:15] Abby Jorgensen: So she's been dealing with that.
[00:50:17] Abby Jorgensen: She said, she messaged me last night hoping that she could get something in.
[00:50:21] Abby Jorgensen: So I just put in some quarter sessions for her so that she feels like she can do something hopefully, but she really wants to.
[00:50:33] Abby Jorgensen: She's like, she's like, don't give up on me.
[00:50:35] Abby Jorgensen: I just have to deal with this.
[00:50:37] Abby Jorgensen: And I'm like, I get it.
[00:50:38] Abby Jorgensen: That's great.
[00:50:39] Gerard Donnelly: That's really wrote on.
[00:50:41] Gerard Donnelly: Okay.
[00:50:41] Gerard Donnelly: Bill?
[00:50:42] Gerard Donnelly: Bill.
[00:50:43] Abby Jorgensen: He's having some good moments.
[00:50:46] Abby Jorgensen: Uh, his FTP, he had his best FTP finally, uh, since he joined.
[00:50:53] Abby Jorgensen: So.
[00:50:54] Abby Jorgensen: Mary FTP Christmas.
[00:50:57] Gerard Donnelly: He moved it on me.
[00:50:59] Abby Jorgensen: He didn't even.
[00:51:00] Abby Jorgensen: He's like, I felt so good.
[00:51:00] Abby Jorgensen: I moved the FTP and did it.
[00:51:02] Abby Jorgensen: I was like, okay, you know, it proved me.
[00:51:06] Abby Jorgensen: That's great.
[00:51:07] Abby Jorgensen: Yeah.
[00:51:08] Abby Jorgensen: So he totally thinks that, yeah, the over-unders and then the VO2 combined this last block.
[00:51:17] Gerard Donnelly: Well, he's right.
[00:51:18] Gerard Donnelly: Well.
[00:51:21] Abby Jorgensen: So is that an hour test?
[00:51:25] Gerard Donnelly: 309?
[00:51:26] Abby Jorgensen: No, that's in 2022.
[00:51:28] Abby Jorgensen: Ah, 2022.
[00:51:30] Gerard Donnelly: Right.
[00:51:30] Gerard Donnelly: Who knows what power matter he was using?
[00:51:33] Gerard Donnelly: Yeah.
[00:51:34] Abby Jorgensen: So that's his best.
[00:51:35] Gerard Donnelly: With us, yeah.
[00:51:38] Gerard Donnelly: So.
[00:51:39] Gerard Donnelly: I think 292 was his.
[00:51:44] Gerard Donnelly: He did July 295.
[00:51:49] Gerard Donnelly: And then 294 in April.
[00:51:56] Gerard Donnelly: 292 in last.
[00:51:58] Gerard Donnelly: There we are.
[00:51:59] Gerard Donnelly: know.
[00:52:00] Gerard Donnelly: November.
[00:52:00] Gerard Donnelly: So that's good.
[00:52:03] Gerard Donnelly: Really good.
[00:52:04] Gerard Donnelly: Yeah.
[00:52:05] Gerard Donnelly: Let's see here.
[00:52:06] Abby Jorgensen: Yeah.
[00:52:06] Abby Jorgensen: He didn't start till April 22nd with us.
[00:52:09] Abby Jorgensen: So, yeah.
[00:52:11] Abby Jorgensen: So, yeah.
[00:52:15] Abby Jorgensen: But he, you we talked about his races this morning.
[00:52:21] Abby Jorgensen: So we'll do White Lake in May, Augusta in September, and then sprinkle in some sprints in Olympics, probably.
[00:52:33] Gerard Donnelly: His wife wanted him to do another full, and he's like, not until next year.
[00:52:37] Abby Jorgensen: Yeah, sorry.
[00:52:38] Gerard Donnelly: I was like, your wife wants you to do one?
[00:52:40] Abby Jorgensen: That's crazy.
[00:52:41] Abby Jorgensen: That is crazy.
[00:52:43] Gerard Donnelly: Did he swim test?
[00:52:45] Abby Jorgensen: He said the pool was closed, and he's like, I've been feeling good at the swim, so I'll just take it for what it is, and I was like, okay.
[00:52:54] Gerard Donnelly: So running-wise, he's running-wise.
[00:52:59] Abby Jorgensen: Yeah.
[00:53:00] Abby Jorgensen: We had cut back a little bit on the running, but now that we're back, he felt really good on his run on, what was that, Sunday?
[00:53:07] Abby Jorgensen: Yep.
[00:53:08] Abby Jorgensen: He left me a note that this Sunday, yeah.
[00:53:15] Abby Jorgensen: Was it this Sunday?
[00:53:16] Abby Jorgensen: Yeah.
[00:53:18] Gerard Donnelly: Okay, A lot of the athletes, we want them just to, you know, stop worrying about intensity of the run and just get running.
[00:53:40] Gerard Donnelly: Yeah, just run.
[00:53:42] Gerard Donnelly: It's hard to not think about it, but.
[00:53:46] Abby Jorgensen: Yeah.
[00:53:48] Gerard Donnelly: A lot of the athletes aren't doing enough running, whatever the reason, injuries, we just need to get their running volume up and just keep reminding them.
[00:53:58] Gerard Donnelly: They're doing a lot of hard work on the bike.
[00:53:59] Gerard Donnelly: of teams tasks.
[00:53:59] Gerard Donnelly: They
[00:54:00] Gerard Donnelly: I don't need to run that much.
[00:54:03] Gerard Donnelly: They need to run a lot, but not with intensity is what I meant to say.
[00:54:07] Gerard Donnelly: Yeah.
[00:54:08] Gerard Donnelly: Okay.
[00:54:09] Abby Jorgensen: Quit following people on social media that says that.
[00:54:15] Gerard Donnelly: Yeah, that's exactly right.
[00:54:17] Gerard Donnelly: You're on a triathlon program, not a running program.
[00:54:20] Abby Jorgensen: Yeah.
[00:54:21] Abby Jorgensen: How's Albert going?
[00:54:23] Gerard Donnelly: He's good.
[00:54:24] Gerard Donnelly: I think he's been pretty compliant.
[00:54:27] Abby Jorgensen: Yeah.
[00:54:28] Abby Jorgensen: Yeah.
[00:54:30] Abby Jorgensen: I mean, for, I mean, he's had a couple of weeks of not, or this, his work schedule will go back to normal.
[00:54:37] Abby Jorgensen: Yes.
[00:54:37] Abby Jorgensen: Okay.
[00:54:38] Abby Jorgensen: But, but yeah, he's been.
[00:54:40] Abby Jorgensen: He's only in week two, isn't he?
[00:54:42] Abby Jorgensen: Week three.
[00:54:42] Abby Jorgensen: Yeah.
[00:54:43] Abby Jorgensen: Yeah.
[00:54:44] Abby Jorgensen: He says he feels pretty good too.
[00:54:45] Abby Jorgensen: So.
[00:54:46] Abby Jorgensen: Yeah.
[00:54:47] Abby Jorgensen: Good.
[00:54:48] Abby Jorgensen: Yeah.
[00:54:55] Gerard Donnelly: Just take it, Abby.
[00:54:57] Gerard Donnelly: Okay.
[00:54:58] Gerard Donnelly: Okay.
[00:55:01] Gerard Donnelly: Gerard speaking.
[00:55:03] Gerard Donnelly: Hey Gerard, how are you doing?
[00:55:04] Gerard Donnelly: My name is Andrew Verde.
[00:55:07] Gerard Donnelly: I was on your website about three or four days ago and I just put in a request to get a call back just for some Ironman training for Cairns.
[00:55:15] Gerard Donnelly: Yes, Andrew.
[00:55:16] Gerard Donnelly: Yep.
[00:55:16] Gerard Donnelly: I was just wondering, are you free to talk?
[00:55:19] Gerard Donnelly: I will be.
[00:55:20] Gerard Donnelly: Can I call you back in half an hour?
[00:55:24] Gerard Donnelly: Yep, no stress at all, that's fine.
[00:55:25] Gerard Donnelly: Alright, talk to you then mate.
[00:55:26] Gerard Donnelly: Awesome, thank you.
[00:55:30] Gerard Donnelly: I thought it might have been a new applicant, which it was.
[00:55:37] Gerard Donnelly: Elbert.
[00:55:39] Gerard Donnelly: Yeah, he's doing good, isn't he?
[00:55:41] Gerard Donnelly: Yep.
[00:55:49] Abby Jorgensen: He was coming off of a work party.
[00:55:51] Abby Jorgensen: Yeah, he didn't sleep for enough time.
[00:55:57] Abby Jorgensen: He told me he didn't get home until 4am and I was like...
[00:56:00] Abby Jorgensen: Oh my gosh.
[00:56:01] Abby Jorgensen: Oh, those were the days.
[00:56:03] Abby Jorgensen: That's impressive that he actually trained.
[00:56:05] Abby Jorgensen: Yeah, I was like, I don't know how kids do it.
[00:56:07] Abby Jorgensen: I mean, he's still a kid, but.
[00:56:12] Gerard Donnelly: That's good.
[00:56:13] Gerard Donnelly: That's really good.
[00:56:15] Gerard Donnelly: He's keen.
[00:56:17] Gerard Donnelly: He was really good to interview.
[00:56:18] Gerard Donnelly: Yeah, he's fun to talk to.
[00:56:21] Abby Jorgensen: He's just smart.
[00:56:24] Gerard Donnelly: I don't know how he does this seven to seven stuff.
[00:56:27] Gerard Donnelly: Crazy.
[00:56:30] Abby Jorgensen: Scott.
[00:56:31] Gerard Donnelly: He's good.
[00:56:32] Gerard Donnelly: Just getting him consistent, so.
[00:56:35] Abby Jorgensen: Yeah.
[00:56:38] Gerard Donnelly: Got sick.
[00:56:40] Gerard Donnelly: Yeah.
[00:56:43] Abby Jorgensen: Yeah, and then I talked to him about his session on his 30-30s.
[00:56:50] Abby Jorgensen: They went fine.
[00:56:51] Abby Jorgensen: He just was shifting too fast.
[00:56:54] Abby Jorgensen: Like, you know how you can get, yeah, it's like seven gear.
[00:57:00] Abby Jorgensen: I think he said it was, I know with mine, it's almost seven gear changes.
[00:57:04] Abby Jorgensen: So I was like, you have to just slowly anticipate it because it's, yeah, it's fast.
[00:57:12] Abby Jorgensen: You have to get it there fast.
[00:57:13] Abby Jorgensen: But yeah.
[00:57:15] Abby Jorgensen: So that's new to him.
[00:57:17] Abby Jorgensen: Yeah.
[00:57:18] Abby Jorgensen: Yeah.
[00:57:19] Gerard Donnelly: Almost at the 26, 27, 28.
[00:57:22] Gerard Donnelly: Yeah.
[00:57:25] Abby Jorgensen: He's all right.
[00:57:26] Abby Jorgensen: Yeah, it's fine.
[00:57:27] Abby Jorgensen: I was like, it's fine.
[00:57:28] Abby Jorgensen: It's just learning.
[00:57:30] Abby Jorgensen: How the trainer, the trainer reacts.
[00:57:33] Abby Jorgensen: He's, he's way above Abby.
[00:57:35] Gerard Donnelly: Jesus.
[00:57:37] Gerard Donnelly: Yeah.
[00:57:38] Abby Jorgensen: I think he just like changes it and like tries to spin as fast as he can.
[00:57:41] Abby Jorgensen: The way it sounded.
[00:57:43] Abby Jorgensen: And I was like, you have to ease into it.
[00:57:45] Abby Jorgensen: Yeah.
[00:57:45] Gerard Donnelly: I'm not sure if he's looking like every one of them, his target is 180 to 217.
[00:57:50] Gerard Donnelly: If we got that wrong.
[00:57:51] Gerard Donnelly: Um, cause he's riding 246.
[00:57:55] Abby Jorgensen: Uh, no, I mean, compared to his, should be right.
[00:58:00] Gerard Donnelly: Like, he's 100 watts outside the range, above.
[00:58:06] Gerard Donnelly: 180 is the bottom, he's at 260.
[00:58:16] Abby Jorgensen: I think that's just because he spiked so much in the beginning.
[00:58:23] Gerard Donnelly: 277, oh my god.
[00:58:24] Gerard Donnelly: Where did he test that?
[00:58:28] Abby Jorgensen: Yeah, did the test last week, didn't he?
[00:58:30] Gerard Donnelly: Yeah.
[00:58:32] Abby Jorgensen: 176, or 167.
[00:58:37] Gerard Donnelly: Hmm.
[00:58:53] Gerard Donnelly: That's right, isn't it?
[00:58:54] Gerard Donnelly: Mm-hmm.
[00:58:57] Gerard Donnelly: Something's weird.
[00:59:14] Gerard Donnelly: Okay, let's see what happens when he starts to do.
[00:59:27] Gerard Donnelly: He's a bit of a beginner, is he?
[00:59:29] Abby Jorgensen: Yeah, remember his first goal was just to be consistent and not overdo it.
[00:59:33] Abby Jorgensen: that's right, yeah.
[00:59:34] Abby Jorgensen: Yeah.
[00:59:38] Abby Jorgensen: Yeah, he was the guy who crashes and burns.
[00:59:41] Abby Jorgensen: Mm-hmm.
[00:59:42] Abby Jorgensen: Is that right?
[00:59:45] Abby Jorgensen: Yeah.
[00:59:46] Gerard Donnelly: See the guy who said he just can't, he has three months off?
[00:59:49] Abby Jorgensen: Yeah, he'll go really hard and then have to take time off because he's too fatigued.
[00:59:55] Abby Jorgensen: Yeah.
[00:59:59] Abby Jorgensen: Yeah, he's fatigued.
[00:59:59] Abby Jorgensen: fatigued.
[00:59:59] Abby Jorgensen: Yeah, he's too fatigued.
[00:59:59] Abby Jorgensen: Yeah, Yeah, Thank
[01:00:04] Gerard Donnelly: Yeah, I think you need to.
[01:00:06] Gerard Donnelly: I would be questioning whether he's seeing the lap power, Abby.
[01:00:11] Gerard Donnelly: I don't.
[01:00:12] Gerard Donnelly: Is he seeing, that would be, do you realise what your lap power is?
[01:00:16] Gerard Donnelly: So this is an example of how you crash and burn.
[01:00:20] Gerard Donnelly: But he's literally, every one of those efforts, he's way above.
[01:00:24] Gerard Donnelly: Tell him there's no need to be.
[01:00:26] Gerard Donnelly: Stop doing that.
[01:00:27] Gerard Donnelly: I would jump on him straight away.
[01:00:28] Gerard Donnelly: Okay.
[01:00:29] Gerard Donnelly: Okay.
[01:00:30] Gerard Donnelly: That's no good.
[01:00:31] Gerard Donnelly: And show him an example of, who did we just look at?
[01:00:36] Gerard Donnelly: Albert.
[01:00:37] Gerard Donnelly: It was freaking brilliant, wasn't it?
[01:00:39] Gerard Donnelly: Take a screenshot of Albert.
[01:00:42] Gerard Donnelly: You know how do this, you?
[01:00:44] Gerard Donnelly: Just.
[01:00:44] Gerard Donnelly: Yeah.
[01:00:46] Gerard Donnelly: Show him that.
[01:00:49] Gerard Donnelly: That's freaking, you know, even if you want to zoom in.
[01:00:55] Gerard Donnelly: No, maybe not.
[01:00:56] Gerard Donnelly: It's still, still no spiking though.
[01:00:58] Gerard Donnelly: That's the point.
[01:01:02] Gerard Donnelly: And say to him, Gerard and I have discussed, do you realise you are 70, 60, 50, 70, 60, you know, you're miles above the range.
[01:01:13] Gerard Donnelly: That's not what we want.
[01:01:14] Gerard Donnelly: We don't want you there.
[01:01:17] Gerard Donnelly: That's what's going to cause you to have massive fatigue.
[01:01:21] Gerard Donnelly: All right.
[01:01:23] Gerard Donnelly: I'm glad you reminded me of who he is.
[01:01:26] Gerard Donnelly: That's, we don't want that.
[01:01:30] Gerard Donnelly: What did he do on this one?
[01:01:35] Abby Jorgensen: It's better, isn't it?
[01:01:36] Abby Jorgensen: Yeah.
[01:01:44] Gerard Donnelly: Yeah.
[01:01:46] Gerard Donnelly: He's still, still spiking at that.
[01:01:48] Gerard Donnelly: Yeah.
[01:01:49] Gerard Donnelly: Every time he has to change gears, it looks like.
[01:01:51] Abby Jorgensen: Yeah.
[01:01:52] Abby Jorgensen: And he's doing it right here.
[01:01:54] Gerard Donnelly: Yeah.
[01:02:02] Abby Jorgensen: So he's above the range here, Abby.
[01:02:04] Gerard Donnelly: It's 137.
[01:02:07] Gerard Donnelly: Do you know what I'm saying?
[01:02:08] Gerard Donnelly: I don't know whether he's looking at it.
[01:02:11] Gerard Donnelly: So even the warm-up is above the range.
[01:02:14] Gerard Donnelly: Is he using Zwift or TrainingPeaks virtual?
[01:02:19] Abby Jorgensen: That looks like...
[01:02:22] Abby Jorgensen: I can't tell.
[01:02:23] Gerard Donnelly: It's Zwift.
[01:02:25] Abby Jorgensen: I can't remember.
[01:02:29] Gerard Donnelly: Anyway, I'm not convinced he's looking at lap power because he's outside the range.
[01:02:36] Gerard Donnelly: Like, he's doing 137 for that three minutes, and the range is 117 to 125.
[01:02:45] Gerard Donnelly: He's in the range there.
[01:02:56] Gerard Donnelly: The rest of him is in the range.
[01:02:58] Gerard Donnelly: The You
[01:03:00] Gerard Donnelly: But I don't know if he knows.
[01:03:02] Gerard Donnelly: That would be my question.
[01:03:04] Abby Jorgensen: Okay.
[01:03:06] Gerard Donnelly: And he's certainly not doing it well in the...
[01:03:12] Gerard Donnelly: He's got the range right there.
[01:03:14] Gerard Donnelly: But the cadence, have I got that cadence low?
[01:03:16] Gerard Donnelly: Have I?
[01:03:16] Gerard Donnelly: 76?
[01:03:17] Gerard Donnelly: Is that what I've got?
[01:03:18] Gerard Donnelly: Those one-minute efforts?
[01:03:19] Gerard Donnelly: That's in zone two, it shouldn't be.
[01:03:24] Gerard Donnelly: Yeah, I have.
[01:03:26] Gerard Donnelly: I've caught myself out there saying to him, what are you doing?
[01:03:29] Gerard Donnelly: Why is your cadence 70?
[01:03:31] Gerard Donnelly: Oh, you told me to.
[01:03:33] Gerard Donnelly: Oh, yeah, I did.
[01:03:37] Abby Jorgensen: Yeah.
[01:03:39] Gerard Donnelly: Otherwise, that's fine.
[01:03:41] Gerard Donnelly: He's, you know, he's not missing anything.
[01:03:43] Gerard Donnelly: He's miswired.
[01:03:52] Gerard Donnelly: Yeah.
[01:03:52] Gerard Donnelly: So my question would be, hey, Scott, Gerard and I just want to know, are you looking at the lap average power and is it set the same...
[01:04:00] Gerard Donnelly: I the Zwift or training virtual app as it is in TrainingPeaks, because it could be set higher in his Zwift app, Abby, for all we know.
[01:04:10] Gerard Donnelly: And he could be doing what the Zwift thing is telling him to do, not what TrainingPeaks.
[01:04:16] Gerard Donnelly: Okay?
[01:04:17] Gerard Donnelly: Yep.
[01:04:22] Gerard Donnelly: All right.
[01:04:24] Gerard Donnelly: Anything else we need to discuss?
[01:04:25] Gerard Donnelly: You happy with that?
[01:04:26] Gerard Donnelly: Yeah, I think that's good.
[01:04:31] Gerard Donnelly: All right.
[01:04:32] Gerard Donnelly: Well, have a good week yourself, and have a good New Year.
[01:04:34] Gerard Donnelly: Yeah, you too.
[01:04:35] Abby Jorgensen: It'll be the New Year for you before me.
[01:04:39] Abby Jorgensen: It will be, I know.
[01:04:41] Gerard Donnelly: All right.
[01:04:41] Gerard Donnelly: Good stuff.
[01:04:42] Gerard Donnelly: Yeah.
[01:04:43] Abby Jorgensen: Talk to you next Monday.
[01:04:44] Abby Jorgensen: See you.
[01:04:45] Gerard Donnelly: Bye.
[01:04:45] Gerard Donnelly: Bye.
