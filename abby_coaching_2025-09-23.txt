## Transcript

[00:00:00] Gerard Donnelly: And then I get a text message from Tyler, and it instantly changes my attitude.
[00:00:08] Gerard Donnelly: It's like, that's what I'm talking about with coaching.
[00:00:12] Gerard Donnelly: That's the messages you want to get.
[00:00:15] Gerard Donnelly: Yeah.
[00:00:16] Abby Jorgensen: Yeah.
[00:00:16] Abby Jorgensen: been really fun to talk with.
[00:00:18] Abby Jorgensen: You have extremes.
[00:00:19] Gerard Donnelly: You have someone who's extremely happy and someone who's extremely upset.
[00:00:23] Abby Jorgensen: Been there, done that.
[00:00:25] Gerard Donnelly: Um, so, um, I just wanted to say, Abby, you just, you just, you're on fire with your, with your athletes.
[00:00:34] Gerard Donnelly: It's, it's absolutely fantastic to get messages like that.
[00:00:39] Gerard Donnelly: It's not about winning.
[00:00:40] Gerard Donnelly: It's about getting the best performance out of each person.
[00:00:44] Gerard Donnelly: And, and that's what you're doing well.
[00:00:47] Gerard Donnelly: And you know that from your gym, you know, just to see people improve is so rewarding.
[00:00:53] Gerard Donnelly: Yeah.
[00:00:53] Abby Jorgensen: I mean, Michaela was like, she joked with me because I posted Coco's thing and she's like, you can't post that.
[00:01:00] Abby Jorgensen: I was like, you finished way before her, in the middle of the night, and then she didn't start.
[00:01:15] Abby Jorgensen: It was weird that they didn't start their race until noon.
[00:01:19] Abby Jorgensen: That is.
[00:01:22] Abby Jorgensen: Yeah.
[00:01:22] Gerard Donnelly: Yeah, in the hottest part of the day.
[00:01:25] Abby Jorgensen: Yeah, she said it was hot in the standing in her wetsuits waiting to get into the water.
[00:01:30] Abby Jorgensen: Yeah, sweating.
[00:01:32] Gerard Donnelly: She's a bit of a gun, isn't she?
[00:01:34] Abby Jorgensen: Yeah.
[00:01:36] Abby Jorgensen: I mean, I was watching.
[00:01:38] Abby Jorgensen: It started at like five something my time.
[00:01:40] Abby Jorgensen: So by the time I got up, she was on the bike.
[00:01:44] Abby Jorgensen: But yeah, by the time she got off the bike, I was like, okay, fourth place.
[00:01:47] Abby Jorgensen: That isn't bad.
[00:01:48] Abby Jorgensen: And then next thing I know, just kept picking off people left and right on the run.
[00:01:53] Abby Jorgensen: She ran superbly, isn't she?
[00:01:55] Gerard Donnelly: Yeah.
[00:01:58] Gerard Donnelly: Yeah.
[00:02:00] Gerard Donnelly: Okay.
[00:02:02] Gerard Donnelly: Might as well just get into it.
[00:02:08] Gerard Donnelly: Michael's just started.
[00:02:09] Gerard Donnelly: So how is he?
[00:02:15] Gerard Donnelly: He did send me a message.
[00:02:19] Gerard Donnelly: So I had a call with him yesterday.
[00:02:22] Gerard Donnelly: Yeah.
[00:02:25] Gerard Donnelly: And I'll just try to find it.
[00:02:31] Gerard Donnelly: I know it wasn't.
[00:02:33] Gerard Donnelly: It wasn't.
[00:02:33] Gerard Donnelly: It was Matt Kroll.
[00:02:34] Gerard Donnelly: Sorry.
[00:02:37] Abby Jorgensen: So Michael.
[00:02:40] Gerard Donnelly: Yeah, he struggled.
[00:02:42] Abby Jorgensen: I don't know what was going on with his kicker and swift.
[00:02:50] Abby Jorgensen: He said he couldn't turn off erg mode.
[00:02:52] Abby Jorgensen: And he was showing me.
[00:02:54] Abby Jorgensen: I'm like, just click the button.
[00:02:55] Abby Jorgensen: And he's like, it's not doing anything.
[00:02:57] Abby Jorgensen: And then mid-ride, he was texting me.
[00:03:00] Abby Jorgensen: was like at eight o'clock on a Friday night.
[00:03:01] Abby Jorgensen: And he was like, it doesn't feel right.
[00:03:04] Abby Jorgensen: So like something's happening.
[00:03:06] Abby Jorgensen: Yeah.
[00:03:06] Abby Jorgensen: And look, I'm looking at the file and it's me too.
[00:03:09] Abby Jorgensen: And I was like, I don't, I don't like it.
[00:03:11] Abby Jorgensen: Obviously, I don't think you're that bad of a writer that you're gonna, if you feel like something was off and it wasn't like responding to you.
[00:03:19] Abby Jorgensen: So I don't, yeah, I don't know what to do with, with that.
[00:03:23] Abby Jorgensen: I mean, the total number isn't terrible, but he wasn't happy with it, obviously.
[00:03:29] Abby Jorgensen: Yeah.
[00:03:29] Abby Jorgensen: Has he tested before?
[00:03:30] Gerard Donnelly: That would be the first thing I'd ask.
[00:03:32] Gerard Donnelly: Has he tested himself before?
[00:03:34] Gerard Donnelly: On a ramp test.
[00:03:36] Abby Jorgensen: Okay.
[00:03:38] Gerard Donnelly: So, so, you know, I'd say to him, why are you unhappy?
[00:03:44] Gerard Donnelly: What are you basing that on?
[00:03:46] Abby Jorgensen: I mean, I think he was unhappy because it was, it felt weird or like, it felt like the ERG was, or the machine was doing something and wasn't responding to him.
[00:03:56] Abby Jorgensen: I don't know.
[00:03:56] Gerard Donnelly: Well, I'm looking at it and it looks like he's warm up.
[00:04:00] Gerard Donnelly: It's fine.
[00:04:01] Gerard Donnelly: Yeah.
[00:04:02] Gerard Donnelly: At the of the ride, it's fine.
[00:04:04] Gerard Donnelly: I just think, I think he's started too high.
[00:04:09] Gerard Donnelly: That's what I think has happened.
[00:04:11] Gerard Donnelly: And it's nothing to do with the machine.
[00:04:13] Gerard Donnelly: That would be my first look observation, is that, what did his ramp test say?
[00:04:21] Abby Jorgensen: His value in training peaks was 250.
[00:04:26] Abby Jorgensen: So he's starting at 278.
[00:04:30] Gerard Donnelly: I don't know.
[00:04:31] Gerard Donnelly: So if the ramp test is even nearer, he's literally 30 watts above.
[00:04:37] Gerard Donnelly: And if I said to you, Abby, Abby, want you to start 30 watts above your last FTP test, in this FTP test, you'd say to me, oh, okay, coach.
[00:04:48] Gerard Donnelly: Or you'd say to me, what the  are you talking about?
[00:04:51] Abby Jorgensen: I wouldn't know.
[00:04:53] Abby Jorgensen: You know what I mean?
[00:04:55] Gerard Donnelly: So this is the investigation I would be doing.
[00:05:00] Gerard Donnelly: eh?
[00:05:00] Gerard Donnelly: Thank
[00:05:00] Gerard Donnelly: to him.
[00:05:00] Gerard Donnelly: I'd be saying, what did your ramp test tell me?
[00:05:03] Gerard Donnelly: Oh, it's 250.
[00:05:04] Gerard Donnelly: Why'd you start at 278?
[00:05:06] Gerard Donnelly: It's literally 30 watts above what your ramp test has told you.
[00:05:09] Gerard Donnelly: And the fact that there's no problem in the warm-up, no problem in the ramp, and no problem in the cool-down.
[00:05:19] Abby Jorgensen: Yeah, I just don't know if the erg was, yeah, I don't know what.
[00:05:21] Abby Jorgensen: It's not even erg.
[00:05:22] Abby Jorgensen: There's no way that's erg.
[00:05:24] Abby Jorgensen: Yeah, I kept saying it wouldn't turn off, and I was like, I don't understand why it wouldn't turn off.
[00:05:29] Abby Jorgensen: Yeah, it's because it's not on.
[00:05:32] Abby Jorgensen: He's almost too techy, like he wants to like, yeah, like change things all the time, because he's a tech.
[00:05:40] Gerard Donnelly: Cadence would have dead straight erg mode, so would the power.
[00:05:43] Gerard Donnelly: It would be straight line.
[00:05:47] Gerard Donnelly: I just, like, he could well, I mean, this number could be fine.
[00:05:53] Gerard Donnelly: It's just so high and low.
[00:05:55] Gerard Donnelly: But we could say to him, what was the conversation?
[00:05:59] Gerard Donnelly: What did
[00:06:00] Gerard Donnelly: Well, was like, let me take a look at it.
[00:06:03] Abby Jorgensen: And then I was like, well, mean, 243 compared to 250 isn't like, like a terrible difference.
[00:06:11] Abby Jorgensen: And if you've never done an actual 20 minute test, it's not, not necessarily a bad thing.
[00:06:18] Abby Jorgensen: You just a ramp test isn't a true.
[00:06:20] Abby Jorgensen: Yeah.
[00:06:21] Abby Jorgensen: Yeah.
[00:06:21] Abby Jorgensen: Okay.
[00:06:22] Gerard Donnelly: I mean, my first thing is we've got two choices here, Michael, you could do it again if you feel that unhappy about it.
[00:06:29] Gerard Donnelly: But but I think it's more the way you executed.
[00:06:32] Gerard Donnelly: You started way too high.
[00:06:33] Gerard Donnelly: If you already know, like, you know, in any conversation with any new athlete, I'm saying to them, tell me what your previous, I would even look at, I'd look at if they've got any data in there.
[00:06:50] Gerard Donnelly: I'd be looking at myself and there's, there's a 250, you know, so I'd be saying to him, hey, your best 20 minutes.
[00:07:01] Gerard Donnelly: It was 2.51, let's start at 2.45, you know, and have that conversation.
[00:07:08] Gerard Donnelly: It's okay to have that conversation.
[00:07:09] Gerard Donnelly: You're not trying to trick them with our first test.
[00:07:12] Gerard Donnelly: We're trying to help them.
[00:07:16] Gerard Donnelly: So I would go back to him and say, you know, we've had a conversation with Gerard.
[00:07:22] Gerard Donnelly: Clearly, we should have looked at, and, you know, you can always say, look, this is my mistake.
[00:07:26] Gerard Donnelly: I should have made you ride at 2.45 to start with.
[00:07:30] Gerard Donnelly: And that I'm just giving you freedom to do what you like, to experience what it's like, to learn how to execute.
[00:07:40] Gerard Donnelly: And, you know, we bang on about execution.
[00:07:43] Gerard Donnelly: And it says in our session, start conservatively.
[00:07:46] Gerard Donnelly: Well, if your previous number, Michael, is 250, why'd you start at 278?
[00:07:52] Gerard Donnelly: You know, and I think, yes, he thinks it's the machine.
[00:07:59] Gerard Donnelly: Again, that's the problem.
[00:08:00] Gerard Donnelly: Well, I think it's him just starting too high.
[00:08:04] Gerard Donnelly: And so that would be the first thing I'd look at.
[00:08:07] Gerard Donnelly: And I'd say to him, your best 20 minutes is 251.
[00:08:11] Gerard Donnelly: So, you know, you've probably, you could have done probably 250 or 255 if you had executed better starting at 245 and go 250 then finish at 260.
[00:08:22] Gerard Donnelly: But if you find that on Tuesday's session, tomorrow morning session for him, that he's, have you said it?
[00:08:31] Gerard Donnelly: Have you said he's FTP or has he said he's FTP?
[00:08:34] Gerard Donnelly: Yeah, I went in there, made sure.
[00:08:38] Gerard Donnelly: What should it be said at?
[00:08:40] Gerard Donnelly: he did, what did he do, 251?
[00:08:44] Gerard Donnelly: Not that.
[00:08:45] Abby Jorgensen: I didn't put that.
[00:08:46] Abby Jorgensen: What was that number?
[00:08:48] Gerard Donnelly: Yeah, 266 is not right, is it?
[00:08:50] Abby Jorgensen: I had gone in there, was it earlier today?
[00:08:54] Abby Jorgensen: It's annoying, isn't it?
[00:08:55] Gerard Donnelly: When you've already gone in there, has he changed it again, has he?
[00:08:58] Gerard Donnelly: To, what did we say, 240?
[00:09:01] Gerard Donnelly: Yeah, so 95% of 243 should be 230-something.
[00:09:06] Abby Jorgensen: Yeah, 231, if you round up, 230.
[00:09:10] Gerard Donnelly: I've just closed it, and I'll raise it again.
[00:09:13] Gerard Donnelly: So maybe if I refresh training fix.
[00:09:23] Gerard Donnelly: Is it reading that on yours?
[00:09:26] Gerard Donnelly: Let me look.
[00:09:34] Abby Jorgensen: Yeah, 266.
[00:09:35] Abby Jorgensen: Okay.
[00:09:36] Gerard Donnelly: You might need to shoot him a message saying, hey, Michael, I don't know what's happened with the settings in TrainingPeaks, but it's set at 266.
[00:09:43] Gerard Donnelly: I'm now changing it to 231.
[00:09:47] Gerard Donnelly: And I would have a conversation with him about what you and I have talked about, even if you want to leave a voice message.
[00:09:55] Gerard Donnelly: What time is it now?
[00:09:56] Gerard Donnelly: There, Abby, 6, is it?
[00:09:58] Gerard Donnelly: Yeah, 6.21.
[00:10:00] Abby Jorgensen: There, yeah, it's five here, but they're an hour ahead.
[00:10:07] Gerard Donnelly: What am I doing?
[00:10:11] Gerard Donnelly: If he finds this is ridiculously easy.
[00:10:15] Gerard Donnelly: Then maybe.
[00:10:16] Abby Jorgensen: Yeah.
[00:10:18] Gerard Donnelly: But I'm texting tonight saying, look, your FTP setting was set at 266.
[00:10:24] Gerard Donnelly: We've put it back to what it should be, 231.
[00:10:27] Gerard Donnelly: I've had a conversation with him about the setup and stuff because it's in that, it's in week one coaches nights.
[00:10:34] Gerard Donnelly: No, I didn't.
[00:10:34] Abby Jorgensen: I mean, I was just going through today and was checking everybody's stuff on a normal Monday and went in and made sure it was changed because I knew he'd be doing it tomorrow morning.
[00:10:46] Abby Jorgensen: Yeah.
[00:10:46] Abby Jorgensen: Okay.
[00:10:49] Gerard Donnelly: Did you click apply when you did it?
[00:10:52] Gerard Donnelly: Did you remember clicking?
[00:10:53] Abby Jorgensen: Yeah.
[00:10:54] Gerard Donnelly: But remember, he should be doing this, not you.
[00:10:56] Abby Jorgensen: Okay.
[00:10:57] Abby Jorgensen: Okay.
[00:10:58] Abby Jorgensen: It's not your job.
[00:10:59] Gerard Donnelly: Because when you.
[00:11:00] Gerard Donnelly: So 25 athletes or 30 athletes, Abby, you can't be doing, you can't be having to be, you need to get every athlete to do their own and get it right.
[00:11:09] Gerard Donnelly: You need to check it, but you're not the one who's supposed to be adjusting the numbers, okay?
[00:11:15] Gerard Donnelly: Okay.
[00:11:16] Abby Jorgensen: I don't know if I made that clear.
[00:11:18] Gerard Donnelly: Sorry if I haven't, but that's, so if you, I'd be telling him also, look, if you feel like after the first two efforts that 226 is too easy for five minutes, strength efforts, then you can go a little bit higher, go 230, 235 if you want it for the last two.
[00:11:42] Gerard Donnelly: And then we can actually get him to retest again.
[00:11:49] Gerard Donnelly: We can do that, no problem, on Thursday's session.
[00:11:54] Gerard Donnelly: Just substitute that session, okay?
[00:11:57] Abby Jorgensen: Yep.
[00:11:58] Gerard Donnelly: So he's just, he's injured.
[00:12:00] Gerard Donnelly: From running?
[00:12:01] Gerard Donnelly: He just hasn't run in a while.
[00:12:04] Abby Jorgensen: Yes.
[00:12:05] Gerard Donnelly: Just remind me, Abby, what's his goal?
[00:12:08] Abby Jorgensen: Iron Man Jacksonville or Florida.
[00:12:12] Abby Jorgensen: And that's not until next August, is it?
[00:12:15] Abby Jorgensen: Next May.
[00:12:17] Abby Jorgensen: May, okay.
[00:12:18] Abby Jorgensen: Yeah, they opened it for registration today because he was like, when did it become $900?
[00:12:24] Abby Jorgensen: I was like, all Iron Mans are starting to get ridiculous.
[00:12:28] Abby Jorgensen: Yeah.
[00:12:30] Gerard Donnelly: So how much running has he done?
[00:12:35] Abby Jorgensen: Not much.
[00:12:36] Abby Jorgensen: ran two miles early last, not that week.
[00:12:43] Abby Jorgensen: Yeah.
[00:12:44] Gerard Donnelly: He hasn't done much, has he?
[00:12:46] Gerard Donnelly: Mm-mm.
[00:12:49] Gerard Donnelly: Yeah.
[00:12:50] Gerard Donnelly: Do you think he should be doing walk-run?
[00:12:56] Abby Jorgensen: I mean, I thought I'd, he only had run like a couple miles.
[00:13:00] Abby Jorgensen: Like...
[00:13:00] Abby Jorgensen: So the stuff today looks pretty good, and he says, like, he hates to walk.
[00:13:05] Abby Jorgensen: So I was, like, debating, like, how quickly I just take him to, like, a 20 or 30-minute jog, but...
[00:13:10] Abby Jorgensen: Yeah.
[00:13:14] Gerard Donnelly: Five by six-minute, 30-second, that's quite a lot.
[00:13:18] Gerard Donnelly: I'd be quite scared about that.
[00:13:29] Gerard Donnelly: But if he, if you just got to be, look, you know what I'm saying?
[00:13:33] Abby Jorgensen: Yeah.
[00:13:34] Gerard Donnelly: Like, we've got to be super careful how much...
[00:13:38] Abby Jorgensen: See, before I talked to him on that Thursday, he ran two miles and said it felt good.
[00:13:43] Abby Jorgensen: Yeah.
[00:13:44] Abby Jorgensen: felt fine.
[00:13:45] Gerard Donnelly: That one on the treadmill, that one?
[00:13:48] Gerard Donnelly: Yeah.
[00:13:49] Gerard Donnelly: Yeah, I'm, I'm a little worried that this is too much.
[00:13:53] Gerard Donnelly: Okay.
[00:13:54] Gerard Donnelly: But, but I would be asking him, how have you pulled up today from that run this morning?
[00:14:00] Gerard Donnelly: I you know, I would imagine he'd have DOMS really bad.
[00:14:08] Gerard Donnelly: Would you?
[00:14:09] Abby Jorgensen: I mean, I don't know.
[00:14:12] Gerard Donnelly: But, well, let's look.
[00:14:14] Gerard Donnelly: He's done 9K, 1K, nothing, nothing, nothing.
[00:14:26] Gerard Donnelly: It just doesn't run.
[00:14:29] Gerard Donnelly: Nothing.
[00:14:30] Gerard Donnelly: Nothing.
[00:14:34] Gerard Donnelly: Nothing.
[00:14:36] Gerard Donnelly: Yeah, this is a super risky, and trying to keep him happy is one thing, but just coming from a care factor, you just need to say to him, you know, Gerard and I are really worried about giving you too much.
[00:14:52] Gerard Donnelly: Okay.
[00:14:52] Gerard Donnelly: I would, the pacing, the pacing.
[00:15:00] Gerard Donnelly: Yeah.
[00:15:00] Gerard Donnelly: Yeah.
[00:15:00] Gerard Donnelly: I even lowered that.
[00:15:02] Abby Jorgensen: I tried to lower that because I was like, originally it was like an 8-something pace, and I'm like, you can't run that, can you?
[00:15:09] Abby Jorgensen: He was like, I don't know.
[00:15:19] Gerard Donnelly: So the furthest he's run is since 2024, 2023, the furthest he's run is 5K.
[00:15:33] Gerard Donnelly: He hasn't run up to 10K.
[00:15:36] Gerard Donnelly: There's obviously a gap between 5K and 10K because they only go in 5K, 10K, half marathon.
[00:15:44] Gerard Donnelly: So he hasn't run any more than 10K.
[00:15:47] Gerard Donnelly: So 5.35 pace is what he's, that's what he did yesterday.
[00:15:56] Gerard Donnelly: That's his PB.
[00:16:02] Gerard Donnelly: So maybe, that's probably right.
[00:16:12] Gerard Donnelly: You've probably set that right.
[00:16:17] Abby Jorgensen: Yeah, I tried to make it as realistic as possible.
[00:16:22] Gerard Donnelly: 5.35 is actually worse.
[00:16:24] Gerard Donnelly: It's six minute day pace.
[00:16:26] Gerard Donnelly: So I think you've, like, you ran way faster.
[00:16:29] Gerard Donnelly: Yeah, that's why I was like...
[00:16:33] Gerard Donnelly: Yeah, well, my only worry is that we're going to make him too sore and injure him straight away.
[00:16:38] Gerard Donnelly: That's...
[00:16:40] Gerard Donnelly: I'll check with how he feels and then maybe...
[00:16:42] Abby Jorgensen: Adjust it.
[00:16:44] Gerard Donnelly: Adjust it.
[00:16:46] Abby Jorgensen: How far down would you go?
[00:16:48] Abby Jorgensen: Like three minutes or...?
[00:16:52] Gerard Donnelly: I...
[00:16:55] Gerard Donnelly: Yeah.
[00:16:58] Gerard Donnelly: I just...
[00:16:59] Gerard Donnelly: just...
[00:16:59] Gerard Donnelly: I...
[00:17:00] Gerard Donnelly: He looks a heavy guy to me.
[00:17:04] Abby Jorgensen: Probably.
[00:17:05] Abby Jorgensen: I'd say he's probably in his 200s or I don't know what that is.
[00:17:11] Gerard Donnelly: Just because he can do it doesn't mean that's what he should do, Abby.
[00:17:14] Gerard Donnelly: That's actually the sentence I need to tell you.
[00:17:16] Gerard Donnelly: Just because he can do it doesn't mean it's right.
[00:17:20] Gerard Donnelly: He could do it and end up with shin splints or stress fracture because his body, we give him two weeks and he looks like he's getting through it.
[00:17:29] Gerard Donnelly: And in two weeks' time, he's actually damaged himself.
[00:17:34] Gerard Donnelly: So we've got to be super careful.
[00:17:36] Gerard Donnelly: I think he's a bit like military where harder is better every time.
[00:17:46] Gerard Donnelly: And that's a real challenge for you to make him think differently, that harder is better on the bike by a mile.
[00:17:55] Gerard Donnelly: Harder is better on the bike.
[00:17:56] Gerard Donnelly: We know that.
[00:17:57] Gerard Donnelly: But that's not the way that we want to run.
[00:18:00] Gerard Donnelly: on on the the
[00:18:00] Gerard Donnelly: If you haven't, your whole sentence is, you haven't been running, Michael, so we can't just go into, you know, a week of running where, you know, you're potentially going to injure yourself.
[00:18:13] Gerard Donnelly: It might not be the first run or the second or third, but after four or five of them, you could be that sore.
[00:18:20] Gerard Donnelly: We could be doing so much damage, you know, you're not sure what's happening.
[00:18:24] Gerard Donnelly: I've just had so many examples of people getting stress reactions and then leading to stress fractures.
[00:18:30] Gerard Donnelly: And it's a hidden one, it creeps up on you, and all of a sudden you're injured and you can't work out why.
[00:18:37] Gerard Donnelly: It's because your load's too much, too soon.
[00:18:41] Gerard Donnelly: Okay.
[00:18:44] Gerard Donnelly: So, yeah, look, if he's going to run like that, I would be giving him one minute off, not 30 seconds, if he's going to do six by five or five by six.
[00:18:57] Gerard Donnelly: You know, if you tell him, if we're doing intervals.
[00:19:00] Abby Jorgensen: a of little bit bit bit of of a
[00:19:00] Gerard Donnelly: If I'm giving Abby intervals, where I know you can run properly intervals, I'm giving you one minute recovery in between your intervals, not 30 seconds.
[00:19:10] Gerard Donnelly: Okay, 30 seconds is for the 90 on, 90 seconds on, 30 seconds off, that's what that's for.
[00:19:17] Gerard Donnelly: We would hardly ever give anybody doing intervals, even though you're looking at that as if it's a 90 on, 30 off, 60 on, 60 off sort of program.
[00:19:28] Gerard Donnelly: But, you know, that's, you know, if you're going to run five minutes at a time, I'd give him 60 seconds, and he might not like that, but he has to learn that it's from a care factor.
[00:19:40] Gerard Donnelly: Okay?
[00:19:41] Abby Jorgensen: Yep.
[00:19:43] Abby Jorgensen: All right?
[00:19:44] Abby Jorgensen: Makes sense.
[00:19:53] Gerard Donnelly: So, with the time he's got to train, he's got minimal time, hasn't he?
[00:20:00] Abby Jorgensen: Yeah, and his daughter and his, I think his wife was out of town this week.
[00:20:05] Abby Jorgensen: Yeah, good.
[00:20:06] Gerard Donnelly: That's good start.
[00:20:07] Gerard Donnelly: That's great.
[00:20:11] Abby Jorgensen: And I'll adjust the running next week, too.
[00:20:14] Gerard Donnelly: If he can do more time on the bike, then push him towards that.
[00:20:19] Gerard Donnelly: Okay.
[00:20:19] Gerard Donnelly: His Sentry rides next weekend, so.
[00:20:22] Abby Jorgensen: Yeah.
[00:20:22] Abby Jorgensen: Yeah.
[00:20:26] Gerard Donnelly: Yeah, I would, you gave him two hours last week, yeah, two hours 30.
[00:20:35] Abby Jorgensen: And he only did 2.07.
[00:20:39] Gerard Donnelly: Just try to get them to progress a little bit with that.
[00:20:45] Gerard Donnelly: And I would be making a comment, you know, every time I give you a, and I know the answer will be, I ran out of time.
[00:20:51] Gerard Donnelly: That's probably going to be the answer.
[00:20:53] Gerard Donnelly: But you have to say, every time I give you two hours 30 and you do 23 minutes less, it means we can't.
[00:21:00] Gerard Donnelly: I progress you next week to 2 hours 45, okay?
[00:21:04] Gerard Donnelly: Because if I go from 2 hours 7 to 2 hours 45, it's too big a jump for some people, okay?
[00:21:13] Abby Jorgensen: Okay.
[00:21:15] Gerard Donnelly: All right.
[00:21:16] Gerard Donnelly: Anything else on him?
[00:21:18] Gerard Donnelly: No.
[00:21:19] Abby Jorgensen: Okay.
[00:21:21] Gerard Donnelly: So Coco, yes, you had some nutrition and mechanical issues.
[00:21:26] Gerard Donnelly: Yeah.
[00:21:26] Abby Jorgensen: I mean, if you look at her, like, numbers, I was going over them with her today.
[00:21:32] Abby Jorgensen: It's, like, a huge – because on the way out, was 166 and almost 23 miles an hour.
[00:21:39] Abby Jorgensen: Yep.
[00:21:40] Abby Jorgensen: And then on the way back, it was, like, 184 and only 19.5 miles an hour.
[00:21:47] Abby Jorgensen: So I don't know what that is in kilometers.
[00:21:49] Abby Jorgensen: Yeah.
[00:21:53] Gerard Donnelly: Is it out and back, is it?
[00:21:55] Gerard Donnelly: Yep.
[00:21:55] Gerard Donnelly: Yeah.
[00:21:56] Abby Jorgensen: I did the first one before the climb.
[00:21:59] Abby Jorgensen: I did the climb separately.
[00:22:00] Abby Jorgensen: Exactly.
[00:22:01] Abby Jorgensen: It's a 10% grade.
[00:22:03] Abby Jorgensen: Yep.
[00:22:05] Gerard Donnelly: So 166 and 184.
[00:22:10] Gerard Donnelly: Was it a headwind coming home?
[00:22:13] Abby Jorgensen: Yeah, she said there was like a wind like the entire time, but it was her, like the storage unit that was rubbing on her tire the entire way back.
[00:22:21] Abby Jorgensen: Yeah.
[00:22:24] Gerard Donnelly: It reads like it's a headwind.
[00:22:25] Gerard Donnelly: Yeah.
[00:22:26] Abby Jorgensen: She said that felt like there, everybody felt like it was like a headwind like almost the entire time, which I was like, well, on the way out, you're 23 miles an hour or whatever, 31.
[00:22:39] Abby Jorgensen: 37.
[00:22:40] Gerard Donnelly: 37 kilometers.
[00:22:42] Abby Jorgensen: Yep.
[00:22:44] Gerard Donnelly: 37 and a half, which is above 25, isn't it?
[00:22:47] Gerard Donnelly: Is it?
[00:22:48] Abby Jorgensen: 24?
[00:22:49] Abby Jorgensen: 37.5?
[00:22:51] Gerard Donnelly: That's 23.
[00:22:54] Abby Jorgensen: I'll get it.
[00:22:55] Gerard Donnelly: I'll get it one day.
[00:22:57] Gerard Donnelly: That one's the hardest one for me to convert.
[00:22:59] Abby Jorgensen: I can't do it.
[00:23:00] Abby Jorgensen: Yep.
[00:23:00] Abby Jorgensen: It doesn't, there's no logic to it.
[00:23:02] Gerard Donnelly: That's why.
[00:23:05] Gerard Donnelly: As long as she doesn't have that happen again, that would be.
[00:23:12] Gerard Donnelly: Yeah, so I was like, well, at least it happened now.
[00:23:15] Abby Jorgensen: Yeah, so she's doing my bio, isn't she?
[00:23:17] Abby Jorgensen: Yeah.
[00:23:21] Gerard Donnelly: Execution-wise, were you happy?
[00:23:23] Abby Jorgensen: Yeah, I mean, we said to push the bike and see what you have on the run.
[00:23:29] Abby Jorgensen: And, like, this is our time now to figure out where your limits are, because I don't think we've gotten to that point yet.
[00:23:36] Gerard Donnelly: She's negative-splitted, and she's had a couple of little walks through the aid stations.
[00:23:41] Gerard Donnelly: Yeah.
[00:23:42] Gerard Donnelly: Did she win by much?
[00:23:47] Abby Jorgensen: I mean, I think it was a couple minutes.
[00:23:52] Abby Jorgensen: Did she know she was winning?
[00:23:55] Gerard Donnelly: No.
[00:23:55] Abby Jorgensen: She said they didn't even, like, you know how they have, like, the tape line for the...
[00:24:00] Abby Jorgensen: First finisher, she didn't even, they didn't even give her that, there was no, she won by three minutes, four minutes, 335, she said she didn't know she won until she got the test from me.
[00:24:32] Gerard Donnelly: Uh, I've got a winning by five minutes, 50.
[00:24:38] Abby Jorgensen: Oh, I was going over the overall, but yeah.
[00:24:41] Abby Jorgensen: Oh, sorry.
[00:24:42] Abby Jorgensen: Yep, sorry.
[00:24:43] Abby Jorgensen: Yeah, you're fine.
[00:24:44] Abby Jorgensen: Did she win overall as well?
[00:24:45] Abby Jorgensen: Yeah.
[00:24:47] Abby Jorgensen: Oh, wow.
[00:24:50] Gerard Donnelly: Yeah, I was like.
[00:24:52] Abby Jorgensen: I didn't realize overall, Abby.
[00:24:54] Gerard Donnelly: Yeah.
[00:24:56] Abby Jorgensen: There was no pro women, but there was pro men, which is.
[00:25:00] Abby Jorgensen: was weird, I thought, but, yeah.
[00:25:11] Gerard Donnelly: Well, so, yeah, she went by 335.
[00:25:13] Gerard Donnelly: Is that what you told me just before?
[00:25:15] Gerard Donnelly: Yeah, 335 overall.
[00:25:20] Gerard Donnelly: Yeah.
[00:25:20] Gerard Donnelly: What did she write?
[00:25:27] Abby Jorgensen: Which she wasn't happy with it, but obviously with what happened, I don't know.
[00:25:32] Abby Jorgensen: She would have at least been, like, 7 or 11, if she kept the same speed, roughly.
[00:25:37] Abby Jorgensen: Yeah.
[00:25:42] Abby Jorgensen: I think her cadence was down, too, so it kind of shows how she was grinding against something.
[00:25:47] Abby Jorgensen: Yeah.
[00:25:48] Abby Jorgensen: She thought it was her break until...
[00:25:51] Gerard Donnelly: I'd be interested to know how hard it was rubbing.
[00:26:00] Gerard Donnelly: So...
[00:26:00] Gerard Donnelly: So she's riding, she took an hour, so yeah, it's a big drop-off, isn't it?
[00:26:08] Abby Jorgensen: Mm-hmm.
[00:26:10] Gerard Donnelly: So that's 42k an hour, seven, and 42k an hour, 15, so it's eight minutes slower.
[00:26:21] Gerard Donnelly: Oh, it's not even 42, it's 39.
[00:26:26] Gerard Donnelly: It's so much slower.
[00:26:28] Abby Jorgensen: Yeah.
[00:26:31] Gerard Donnelly: Mm, all right.
[00:26:35] Gerard Donnelly: No, that's absolutely brilliant.
[00:26:40] Gerard Donnelly: Okay, anything on her?
[00:26:42] Gerard Donnelly: She's preparing for the worlds now.
[00:26:45] Gerard Donnelly: Yeah.
[00:26:49] Gerard Donnelly: So you're giving her a little bit of an easy week, which is great.
[00:26:52] Gerard Donnelly: Yeah, she wanted it too.
[00:26:54] Abby Jorgensen: She was like, I'm ready for a little break.
[00:26:55] Abby Jorgensen: I'm like, that's fine.
[00:26:56] Abby Jorgensen: Yeah, good.
[00:26:59] Gerard Donnelly: Okay.
[00:27:00] Gerard Donnelly: Dougie?
[00:27:01] Abby Jorgensen: I mean, he got third in his race this weekend, which, considering he actually did really well.
[00:27:09] Gerard Donnelly: Can you find – have you got the results app for that?
[00:27:14] Gerard Donnelly: No.
[00:27:15] Abby Jorgensen: Can you put that on the – Did you?
[00:27:18] Abby Jorgensen: I just put his – I couldn't I found it at one point.
[00:27:23] Abby Jorgensen: Can just copy and paste that into the app later on for me?
[00:27:28] Abby Jorgensen: I'll make note to do that.
[00:27:30] Abby Jorgensen: Some of that's harder to find.
[00:27:32] Abby Jorgensen: I know.
[00:27:33] Gerard Donnelly: And it takes me too long, Abby.
[00:27:35] Gerard Donnelly: there's too many people racing, I'm spending literally two hours finding results and stuff.
[00:27:42] Gerard Donnelly: I'd rather each coach do it for me.
[00:27:44] Gerard Donnelly: So, you know, when Marvin has, you know, the weekend results, if you can just – rather than me putting in your athletes, I'd rather you put – you know, the – if – to me.
[00:28:00] Gerard Donnelly: know.
[00:28:00] Gerard Donnelly: If Marvin can't find the results, if you can find them, just put, you know, here's the results for Douglas.
[00:28:08] Gerard Donnelly: So 4.30, 4.32, great.
[00:28:14] Gerard Donnelly: That's pretty good.
[00:28:16] Abby Jorgensen: Pretty sure that's close to a PB, yeah.
[00:28:20] Abby Jorgensen: Yeah.
[00:28:22] Gerard Donnelly: I don't know what that is.
[00:28:26] Gerard Donnelly: So he's 4.55 pace and he's run.
[00:28:30] Gerard Donnelly: 4.28, that's really good.
[00:28:36] Gerard Donnelly: He didn't get to do any sessions before the race.
[00:28:39] Gerard Donnelly: Yeah, yeah, I don't know.
[00:28:43] Abby Jorgensen: That's interesting, isn't it?
[00:28:44] Gerard Donnelly: Mm-hmm.
[00:28:56] Abby Jorgensen: Yeah, this was, there was four laps.
[00:28:58] Abby Jorgensen: Yeah.
[00:28:59] Abby Jorgensen: Yeah.
[00:29:00] Abby Jorgensen: I mean, I did it in four.
[00:29:02] Abby Jorgensen: was pretty much all the same.
[00:29:04] Abby Jorgensen: Yep.
[00:29:04] Abby Jorgensen: That's good.
[00:29:05] Gerard Donnelly: Power's good.
[00:29:06] Gerard Donnelly: Is he in the ranges that you wanted him to do?
[00:29:09] Abby Jorgensen: Yeah.
[00:29:10] Abby Jorgensen: I mean, he might have been a little high, actually.
[00:29:13] Abby Jorgensen: Yeah.
[00:29:13] Abby Jorgensen: But he's been so inconsistent, we don't really have any recent results for him.
[00:29:19] Abby Jorgensen: Well, now I've got that race.
[00:29:20] Gerard Donnelly: That's great.
[00:29:21] Gerard Donnelly: Yeah.
[00:29:22] Gerard Donnelly: He's happy?
[00:29:23] Gerard Donnelly: Yeah.
[00:29:24] Abby Jorgensen: He was like, I didn't expect to actually even come close to podium.
[00:29:27] Abby Jorgensen: He's like, did better than, I'm trying to think how many minutes faster than last year.
[00:29:31] Abby Jorgensen: did the same one.
[00:29:32] Abby Jorgensen: Oh, he did, did he?
[00:29:34] Abby Jorgensen: Yeah.
[00:29:35] Abby Jorgensen: Did you have a look at that?
[00:29:38] Abby Jorgensen: He told me what it was.
[00:29:44] Gerard Donnelly: Was it the same day, was it?
[00:29:48] Gerard Donnelly: I don't know if it was.
[00:29:50] Gerard Donnelly: I'm always intrigued when someone's done it before.
[00:29:54] Gerard Donnelly: I really want to find out.
[00:29:55] Gerard Donnelly: I'm 17 minutes faster than my.
[00:29:59] Abby Jorgensen: It's massive.
[00:30:00] Gerard Donnelly: All that information is really good.
[00:30:05] Gerard Donnelly: She was like, what I wanted to do was get out of my wetsuit faster, but then I ended up getting third.
[00:30:13] Abby Jorgensen: was like, well.
[00:30:16] Gerard Donnelly: Yeah.
[00:30:17] Gerard Donnelly: So stats like that are really helpful for us as well.
[00:30:21] Gerard Donnelly: You know, if you can let me know that stuff.
[00:30:26] Gerard Donnelly: A comparison.
[00:30:28] Gerard Donnelly: Because we're trying to use our social media a lot to encourage people to join.
[00:30:35] Gerard Donnelly: And, you know, if you can tell me, you know, Doogie did this race a year ago and we've only been coaching for six months.
[00:30:41] Gerard Donnelly: How long have we been coaching for?
[00:30:43] Abby Jorgensen: Yeah, it's been since, when did I start?
[00:30:47] Abby Jorgensen: February, March?
[00:30:48] Abby Jorgensen: Yeah.
[00:30:50] Gerard Donnelly: 17, what improvement?
[00:30:51] Gerard Donnelly: That's great.
[00:30:53] Gerard Donnelly: Okay.
[00:30:59] Gerard Donnelly: Thank you.
[00:31:00] Gerard Donnelly: Thank
[00:31:03] Gerard Donnelly: I'm just making notes for Coco and for Doogie.
[00:31:06] Gerard Donnelly: Good.
[00:31:09] Gerard Donnelly: What's next for Doogie?
[00:31:11] Abby Jorgensen: He has that, cycling, and then a high rocks.
[00:31:17] Abby Jorgensen: Yeah, and then it's winter.
[00:31:18] Abby Jorgensen: Yeah, he said he wants, he was trying to figure out, he wants to, I think, stick with sprints.
[00:31:23] Abby Jorgensen: And I was like, I mean, he's an athlete made for sprints right now.
[00:31:27] Abby Jorgensen: I mean, as a rugby player, so I was like, we'll stick with that as your goal, and then we'll register for some next year.
[00:31:35] Gerard Donnelly: During winter, if you can get him to start doing some park runs, Abby, some Saturday morning park runs, the UK have a lot of park runs, okay?
[00:31:44] Abby Jorgensen: Okay.
[00:31:45] Gerard Donnelly: And they're on every Saturday morning.
[00:31:48] Gerard Donnelly: And, you know, as a training session, if you wanted him to do it, it doesn't have to be a testing week.
[00:31:53] Gerard Donnelly: You can just get him to do it as a training session.
[00:31:55] Gerard Donnelly: And it's normally an eight o'clock park run every Saturday.
[00:32:00] Gerard Donnelly: I've talked to
[00:32:01] Gerard Donnelly: We were talking the park runs, haven't I, in Australia and the UK?
[00:32:03] Abby Jorgensen: The US has a few of them, but not many.
[00:32:06] Abby Jorgensen: Yeah, I mean, they're usually scheduled and they give one, so.
[00:32:11] Abby Jorgensen: Yeah.
[00:32:11] Gerard Donnelly: So during the winter, if you can get him to think about building his endurance, you know, really, really give him a mindset of what are our goals during the winter?
[00:32:20] Gerard Donnelly: You know, get on the trainer and start to get some really good strength and endurance on the bike and pick out some park runs to do or some 10Ks, you know, just give him some incentive.
[00:32:36] Gerard Donnelly: A lot of athletes will drop off, Abby, if there's nothing that they can think they're training for.
[00:32:42] Gerard Donnelly: What's the purpose of me training from, you know, November, December, January, February in the middle of winter?
[00:32:47] Gerard Donnelly: What am I trying to do here?
[00:32:48] Gerard Donnelly: Why don't I just wait for next year?
[00:32:50] Gerard Donnelly: You know, and you've got to be telling them, no, if you go, we've got you to level six.
[00:32:55] Gerard Donnelly: If you go off now, you'll be back at level three.
[00:32:58] Gerard Donnelly: Then by the time we get to, you know, main.
[00:33:01] Gerard Donnelly: Next year, you'll be only just getting back to where you were.
[00:33:03] Gerard Donnelly: So give them that incentive of now's the time to keep adding to your fitness.
[00:33:09] Gerard Donnelly: I'm just telling you this in case athletes start to say that to you during the Northern Hemisphere athletes.
[00:33:16] Gerard Donnelly: They're going to do one or two things, motivate to improve or take a break.
[00:33:21] Gerard Donnelly: That's what's going to happen.
[00:33:23] Gerard Donnelly: And we work so hard to get them to their fitness level.
[00:33:26] Gerard Donnelly: We don't want them taking breaks because when they come back on, it's starting again.
[00:33:34] Gerard Donnelly: Okay?
[00:33:35] Abby Jorgensen: Yep.
[00:33:36] Gerard Donnelly: So keep feeding that motivating kind of, hey, Doogie, this is what we need to be working on, you know?
[00:33:44] Gerard Donnelly: All right?
[00:33:45] Gerard Donnelly: Have those conversations.
[00:33:47] Gerard Donnelly: Okay.
[00:33:50] Gerard Donnelly: Andrew, you're going all right?
[00:33:52] Gerard Donnelly: Yeah, he felt better in the pool today.
[00:33:55] Abby Jorgensen: That's what he was nervous about this morning, but he said he felt a lot better in the pool today.
[00:34:01] Abby Jorgensen: Yep.
[00:34:05] Abby Jorgensen: So I told him our goal this week is to get him outside on the bike, get over the, but he rode, he rode inside this.
[00:34:14] Abby Jorgensen: He was going to go half and half, and then I don't, I think he said that he started to get sore inside after two hours, and so didn't want to go out on rough roads.
[00:34:25] Abby Jorgensen: Yep.
[00:34:26] Abby Jorgensen: But.
[00:34:29] Abby Jorgensen: Yeah, it's tough.
[00:34:32] Gerard Donnelly: Is he riding, is he riding the course?
[00:34:34] Gerard Donnelly: What's he doing?
[00:34:35] Gerard Donnelly: no, he's not.
[00:34:35] Gerard Donnelly: He's just riding.
[00:34:36] Gerard Donnelly: Yeah.
[00:34:39] Abby Jorgensen: Is that Zwift or is that Training Peaks?
[00:34:42] Gerard Donnelly: That's Zwift.
[00:34:43] Abby Jorgensen: That's Zwift, yeah, okay.
[00:34:44] Gerard Donnelly: I can't tell anymore between Zwift and Training Peaks.
[00:34:48] Gerard Donnelly: The Training Peaks looks exactly the same.
[00:34:51] Gerard Donnelly: Really?
[00:34:52] Abby Jorgensen: Wow.
[00:34:52] Abby Jorgensen: I've only tried it a couple times, and I don't know.
[00:34:56] Abby Jorgensen: Yeah.
[00:34:56] Abby Jorgensen: I didn't really like it, but.
[00:34:58] Gerard Donnelly: The guy who did Zwift has been.
[00:35:01] Gerard Donnelly: I Thank
[00:35:01] Gerard Donnelly: So he's just basically copied it.
[00:35:06] Gerard Donnelly: Super important that he's getting the distance in.
[00:35:13] Gerard Donnelly: He got his run in and felt pretty good.
[00:35:16] Abby Jorgensen: A little sore afterwards.
[00:35:21] Gerard Donnelly: Just be careful, Abby, that some of these ones with the four-by efforts, they're the ones we should be doing in between.
[00:35:32] Gerard Donnelly: So just don't give him a straight 180, 140, 120, 160 every week.
[00:35:41] Gerard Donnelly: Try to give him a week where he's got some efforts.
[00:35:45] Gerard Donnelly: So he's got a break.
[00:35:47] Gerard Donnelly: So alternate them almost.
[00:35:50] Gerard Donnelly: One week, you know, the idea would be to try to get him to, if he's going to do a Zwift session, is to make it changing great.
[00:36:01] Gerard Donnelly: right.
[00:36:01] Gerard Donnelly: And so he's getting to change gears and not just sitting there stuck for three hours in the one power.
[00:36:08] Gerard Donnelly: It's mind-numbing.
[00:36:10] Gerard Donnelly: And plus it's, you know, we want variety.
[00:36:14] Gerard Donnelly: And if he's not able to get that from outside, where does he live?
[00:36:18] Gerard Donnelly: Indiana.
[00:36:19] Abby Jorgensen: Okay.
[00:36:20] Gerard Donnelly: So is there good venues outside for him to do it?
[00:36:22] Abby Jorgensen: He has good, like pretty flat, non-interrupted things.
[00:36:28] Gerard Donnelly: Why is he choosing indoor?
[00:36:31] Abby Jorgensen: Because of his crash.
[00:36:33] Abby Jorgensen: Yes.
[00:36:34] Abby Jorgensen: Okay.
[00:36:34] Abby Jorgensen: Yeah.
[00:36:35] Abby Jorgensen: Yeah.
[00:36:36] Gerard Donnelly: And so he's still worried about that?
[00:36:39] Gerard Donnelly: Yeah.
[00:36:39] Gerard Donnelly: He just had a mental block with going outside.
[00:36:42] Abby Jorgensen: Yeah.
[00:36:42] Abby Jorgensen: Okay.
[00:36:43] Gerard Donnelly: See if you can encourage him to get out because he's going to have to do it.
[00:36:46] Gerard Donnelly: Yeah.
[00:36:47] Abby Jorgensen: This weekend we have to.
[00:36:49] Abby Jorgensen: Like we got to get over it.
[00:36:53] Gerard Donnelly: And then maybe your wife follow you or something.
[00:36:58] Abby Jorgensen: Say that again?
[00:36:59] Abby Jorgensen: Oh, your wife.
[00:36:59] Abby Jorgensen: Yeah.
[00:36:59] Abby Jorgensen: Yeah.
[00:37:00] Abby Jorgensen: Like if you can get your wife.
[00:37:01] Abby Jorgensen: Do have to follow you for a little bit or something just so that you can mentally get over?
[00:37:05] Abby Jorgensen: Yeah.
[00:37:06] Gerard Donnelly: So, yeah, just maybe throw in one week where, like he's doing this week coming.
[00:37:18] Gerard Donnelly: I would just throw in a bunch ride sort of, you know, opportunity where you just get out there and you want him to be riding for five to six hours, you know.
[00:37:28] Gerard Donnelly: know, if you want him to do the 180K that week, that's fine.
[00:37:34] Gerard Donnelly: But we just don't want to do 120, 140, 180.
[00:37:38] Gerard Donnelly: Just I would rather him just go and have some fun.
[00:37:41] Gerard Donnelly: It's, you know exactly what I'm talking about.
[00:37:45] Gerard Donnelly: If you're just doing that time trial every week, you know, a few weeks I threw in where just go for a six-hour ride, remember, or five-and-a-half-hour ride.
[00:37:55] Gerard Donnelly: And where, you know, pressure on and off, find variations in the course even though you didn't.
[00:38:01] Gerard Donnelly: They have a lot of that, but, yeah, that, you know, they'll hate the training if they just have to do that every week, okay?
[00:38:11] Gerard Donnelly: Okay.
[00:38:12] Gerard Donnelly: So you've got lots of sessions in there that do break it up into, you know, six by 45 minutes or four by one hour or, you know, two by two hours or whatever.
[00:38:24] Gerard Donnelly: But just give them something or just give them that bunch ride option where you're just wanting them to go outdoors.
[00:38:38] Gerard Donnelly: I think it's under that.
[00:38:39] Abby Jorgensen: Yeah.
[00:38:40] Gerard Donnelly: So, you know, pick one of these, this five-hour one, you know, just get them to do that.
[00:38:45] Gerard Donnelly: Just go for it.
[00:38:45] Gerard Donnelly: I want you out there for five hours.
[00:38:47] Gerard Donnelly: You go wherever you like.
[00:38:50] Gerard Donnelly: Okay.
[00:38:51] Abby Jorgensen: Okay.
[00:38:52] Abby Jorgensen: That might ease his mind a little bit too.
[00:38:54] Abby Jorgensen: Yep.
[00:38:55] Abby Jorgensen: Yeah.
[00:38:55] Gerard Donnelly: Even if you want to do that for this Saturday, change that if you want it.
[00:38:58] Gerard Donnelly: Okay.
[00:39:05] Abby Jorgensen: Okay.
[00:39:06] Abby Jorgensen: Yep.
[00:39:08] Gerard Donnelly: Better keep moving because I'm running out of time.
[00:39:10] Gerard Donnelly: Sorry.
[00:39:11] Gerard Donnelly: We like to talk.
[00:39:13] Abby Jorgensen: I know.
[00:39:14] Abby Jorgensen: We take too much time on each one.
[00:39:15] Abby Jorgensen: So Cindy's off.
[00:39:16] Abby Jorgensen: Yeah.
[00:39:19] Gerard Donnelly: Isabella, what's she aiming for?
[00:39:21] Gerard Donnelly: Melbourne, is it?
[00:39:22] Abby Jorgensen: She does have the, yeah, she just got a ticket to the Melbourne Marathon.
[00:39:26] Abby Jorgensen: She did.
[00:39:27] Abby Jorgensen: She got it.
[00:39:28] Abby Jorgensen: Yeah.
[00:39:29] Abby Jorgensen: She bought it off somebody.
[00:39:31] Abby Jorgensen: Oh, God.
[00:39:32] Abby Jorgensen: Okay.
[00:39:32] Abby Jorgensen: I know.
[00:39:32] Abby Jorgensen: I was like, okay, well, here we go.
[00:39:38] Abby Jorgensen: She's really gung-ho, though.
[00:39:39] Abby Jorgensen: I mean, I got her on the bike.
[00:39:41] Abby Jorgensen: She did the FTP test.
[00:39:43] Abby Jorgensen: Yep.
[00:39:44] Abby Jorgensen: So, hey.
[00:39:46] Abby Jorgensen: Yep.
[00:39:47] Gerard Donnelly: And it's almost, you know, incredible that she's actually now able to do training.
[00:39:56] Gerard Donnelly: So she must be excited.
[00:39:58] Gerard Donnelly: Yeah, she was pretty gung-ho about...
[00:40:00] Abby Jorgensen: out!
[00:40:02] Abby Jorgensen: I don't know.
[00:40:03] Abby Jorgensen: She was like, I'm even watching the videos on the website.
[00:40:05] Abby Jorgensen: I'm like, good.
[00:40:08] Abby Jorgensen: That's a turnaround.
[00:40:09] Gerard Donnelly: Well done.
[00:40:10] Gerard Donnelly: Yeah.
[00:40:12] Gerard Donnelly: And you've got all the settings right from her FTP?
[00:40:15] Abby Jorgensen: Yes.
[00:40:17] Gerard Donnelly: Make sure you check all that.
[00:40:18] Abby Jorgensen: I'll double check, but I'm pretty sure I did because I knew I did it because I knew she wouldn't.
[00:40:27] Abby Jorgensen: I was like, I got to do it first or I'll never.
[00:40:30] Gerard Donnelly: What about Kevin?
[00:40:31] Gerard Donnelly: How's his start?
[00:40:33] Gerard Donnelly: Was it okay?
[00:40:35] Abby Jorgensen: Yeah, it's on the Wahoo because the guy that was going to sell him the pedals kind of fell through.
[00:40:42] Abby Jorgensen: So I was like, we got to just keep training.
[00:40:45] Abby Jorgensen: So we'll do an FTP on the Wahoo and then go from there.
[00:40:49] Abby Jorgensen: He's indoor though, isn't he, Abby?
[00:40:52] Abby Jorgensen: Yeah.
[00:40:53] Gerard Donnelly: The only thing is we're going to have all this data.
[00:40:57] Gerard Donnelly: We're going have all this data for the Wahoo.
[00:40:59] Gerard Donnelly: And then when we change the pedals, it's going to change.
[00:41:01] Gerard Donnelly: And his brain, the pedals might be 10% higher or lower.
[00:41:04] Abby Jorgensen: I told him that.
[00:41:06] Abby Jorgensen: I did a video for him today and explained that, but I didn't want to hold off too much longer.
[00:41:12] Abby Jorgensen: No, what you're doing is spot on.
[00:41:14] Gerard Donnelly: So his injury for running is still taking time, isn't it?
[00:41:18] Abby Jorgensen: Yeah, I told him to let me know when his PT said he can maybe even start, you know, like a walk jog or something.
[00:41:24] Gerard Donnelly: Yeah, but in the meantime, I think you're giving him exactly the right.
[00:41:29] Gerard Donnelly: I would give him one more ride session, Abby, on the Sunday.
[00:41:34] Gerard Donnelly: Okay.
[00:41:35] Gerard Donnelly: Give him another Zone 2.
[00:41:37] Gerard Donnelly: So just grab one of the Zone 2 over-unders, something like any of this batch here.
[00:41:48] Gerard Donnelly: Okay.
[00:41:49] Gerard Donnelly: Any of those, that one, or the four-step, or if you wanted to do some little out-of-the-seat sprints to break it up, grab some of these where they're doing 10-second sprints.
[00:41:59] Gerard Donnelly: Okay.
[00:41:59] Abby Jorgensen: Okay.
[00:42:00] Abby Jorgensen: Um,
[00:42:01] Gerard Donnelly: And you could also, if you want to, you could give him a Zone 2 out to, is he using Zwift?
[00:42:07] Abby Jorgensen: Yeah, I mean, he can go outside, he just doesn't have power yet outside.
[00:42:11] Abby Jorgensen: Okay, where does he live?
[00:42:15] Abby Jorgensen: In the Scandinavian countries, isn't it?
[00:42:17] Gerard Donnelly: Yeah, we're, like, in Norway, is it Norway?
[00:42:21] Abby Jorgensen: Norway, yeah.
[00:42:23] Abby Jorgensen: I was like, it's somewhere.
[00:42:26] Gerard Donnelly: Well, if he's still able to ride outside, get him outside.
[00:42:29] Gerard Donnelly: Yeah, think he was, well, he was in Denmark last week, but.
[00:42:33] Abby Jorgensen: Yep.
[00:42:33] Gerard Donnelly: So, if he's outside, go to the endurance rides, Zone 2, where are they?
[00:42:40] Gerard Donnelly: So, you can do, you can do any of these, where it's just Zone 2.
[00:42:47] Gerard Donnelly: You know, Zone 2, an hour and a half, Hour 45, for the Sunday I'm talking.
[00:42:53] Gerard Donnelly: Or, you can give him a little bit more variety.
[00:42:59] Gerard Donnelly: Um, So, So, And you, you.
[00:43:01] Gerard Donnelly: So I would be giving him two rides.
[00:43:03] Gerard Donnelly: When he's not running, we need him to actually do two hard rides, one long ride, one zone two, and then one recovery.
[00:43:12] Gerard Donnelly: Okay?
[00:43:12] Abby Jorgensen: Okay.
[00:43:14] Gerard Donnelly: So chuck another one in there.
[00:43:28] Abby Jorgensen: I'm trying to think if there's somebody for sure that we could...
[00:43:33] Abby Jorgensen: What about Mark?
[00:43:34] Gerard Donnelly: That's Mark Kroll.
[00:43:37] Gerard Donnelly: Yeah.
[00:43:38] Gerard Donnelly: He was talking about drink size with me?
[00:43:40] Gerard Donnelly: Yeah.
[00:43:41] Gerard Donnelly: Like, I don't...
[00:43:42] Abby Jorgensen: I would trust your bike fitter, but I have no...
[00:43:44] Abby Jorgensen: Yep, so we've sorted that out.
[00:43:46] Gerard Donnelly: And then he was talking about Chattanooga...
[00:43:50] Gerard Donnelly: When's his Chattanooga race?
[00:43:52] Gerard Donnelly: It's next May.
[00:43:54] Abby Jorgensen: Yeah, okay.
[00:43:55] Abby Jorgensen: Oh, yeah.
[00:43:56] Abby Jorgensen: So, yeah.
[00:43:58] Gerard Donnelly: Does he live anywhere where there's lots of hills?
[00:44:01] Gerard Donnelly: Where's he live?
[00:44:01] Gerard Donnelly: He lives in Nashville, so yeah, there's hills out there.
[00:44:04] Gerard Donnelly: Yeah, so encourage.
[00:44:09] Gerard Donnelly: Yeah, he went outside on, he goes outside on Wednesdays usually.
[00:44:13] Gerard Donnelly: He's got a half marathon November, then a 70.3, 2026, is that right?
[00:44:18] Gerard Donnelly: Yep.
[00:44:19] Gerard Donnelly: Yep, okay.
[00:44:21] Gerard Donnelly: How's his running coming along?
[00:44:23] Abby Jorgensen: It's good, like he feels, he said he feels pretty strong, like some of his, like even checking some of his paces and stuff.
[00:44:29] Abby Jorgensen: Yep.
[00:44:31] Abby Jorgensen: I didn't know, so in two weeks he tests, we retest, and we didn't test a run the first test week because of a previous injury.
[00:44:41] Abby Jorgensen: Yes.
[00:44:41] Abby Jorgensen: we test a 5K or a 10K since he has a half marathon coming up?
[00:44:45] Abby Jorgensen: Yeah, I do the 10K, Abby.
[00:44:47] Gerard Donnelly: Okay.
[00:44:49] Gerard Donnelly: Yeah.
[00:44:52] Abby Jorgensen: Okay, I put the 10K in there, right?
[00:44:55] Abby Jorgensen: just, that was, yeah.
[00:44:57] Gerard Donnelly: And did you put that on the Thursday?
[00:45:01] Gerard Donnelly: Wednesday, Thursday, Friday, for a particular reason.
[00:45:04] Abby Jorgensen: That's just like his schedule.
[00:45:06] Abby Jorgensen: Yep.
[00:45:07] Abby Jorgensen: by the way.
[00:45:08] Abby Jorgensen: Saturday, he's church.
[00:45:10] Abby Jorgensen: Yeah, he has church.
[00:45:12] Abby Jorgensen: Yeah.
[00:45:12] Abby Jorgensen: Okay.
[00:45:13] Gerard Donnelly: No, that's fine.
[00:45:14] Gerard Donnelly: That's absolutely fine.
[00:45:15] Gerard Donnelly: Yep.
[00:45:16] Gerard Donnelly: Okay.
[00:45:19] Gerard Donnelly: Who else is new?
[00:45:20] Gerard Donnelly: Riley's new, isn't he?
[00:45:21] Gerard Donnelly: Yeah, he's really new.
[00:45:22] Gerard Donnelly: He's retesting this week.
[00:45:24] Abby Jorgensen: Yep.
[00:45:24] Abby Jorgensen: And then he has the gravel race in Colorado this weekend.
[00:45:29] Abby Jorgensen: Oh, okay.
[00:45:30] Gerard Donnelly: Yep.
[00:45:30] Gerard Donnelly: Yeah.
[00:45:33] Gerard Donnelly: He's red dirt fish.
[00:45:34] Gerard Donnelly: Yeah.
[00:45:38] Gerard Donnelly: Okay.
[00:45:40] Gerard Donnelly: I'm always interested in Peter Mendez.
[00:45:43] Gerard Donnelly: Is everything going all right with him?
[00:45:46] Abby Jorgensen: Yeah.
[00:45:47] Abby Jorgensen: He's moving this week.
[00:45:49] Abby Jorgensen: So that'll be a little.
[00:45:51] Gerard Donnelly: Across the country?
[00:45:52] Gerard Donnelly: Yeah, across the country.
[00:45:57] Abby Jorgensen: So he wanted to try to stay as normal as as possible.
[00:46:01] Abby Jorgensen: week.
[00:46:01] Abby Jorgensen: So we'll see how it ends up.
[00:46:04] Gerard Donnelly: So Marbella, he's doing?
[00:46:06] Gerard Donnelly: Yep.
[00:46:07] Gerard Donnelly: That's great that that's there, Abby.
[00:46:09] Gerard Donnelly: It's really good.
[00:46:10] Gerard Donnelly: That helps me remember who's who.
[00:46:18] Gerard Donnelly: Yep.
[00:46:18] Gerard Donnelly: All right.
[00:46:20] Gerard Donnelly: You know how you're giving him intervals for the roast ready?
[00:46:23] Gerard Donnelly: That's fantastic.
[00:46:24] Gerard Donnelly: Absolutely perfect.
[00:46:25] Gerard Donnelly: But the same thing, alternate between, you know, a 90K, a 75K, and these.
[00:46:33] Gerard Donnelly: All right?
[00:46:34] Abby Jorgensen: Okay.
[00:46:34] Gerard Donnelly: Even though you've got this off our template, already my thought process has changed from when I wrote that template.
[00:46:47] Gerard Donnelly: Just doing intervals all the time is just as bad as just doing straight time trials all the time.
[00:46:52] Gerard Donnelly: So we want to mix them.
[00:46:54] Gerard Donnelly: Okay.
[00:46:54] Gerard Donnelly: Okay.
[00:46:55] Gerard Donnelly: So if you give him week one four by 30 minutes, then
[00:47:01] Gerard Donnelly: Week two, give him 75K straight, okay?
[00:47:04] Gerard Donnelly: And then week three, give him this session.
[00:47:09] Gerard Donnelly: Move that, you know, move that down a little, sorry.
[00:47:26] Gerard Donnelly: Okay, so that way, and 6K run off the bike, I'd probably make that a bit longer, Abby.
[00:47:38] Gerard Donnelly: I'd make that to 10.
[00:47:39] Gerard Donnelly: 10.
[00:47:40] Gerard Donnelly: Or 8.
[00:47:47] Gerard Donnelly: It's not going to do it.
[00:47:49] Gerard Donnelly: Anyway, yeah, I'd make that 10K there, maybe 12K there, and then 14K here.
[00:47:59] Gerard Donnelly: I know, it's happened.
[00:48:01] Gerard Donnelly: So that's all right.
[00:48:03] Gerard Donnelly: Make that 10 and 12.
[00:48:04] Gerard Donnelly: So just change that one to 12.
[00:48:17] Gerard Donnelly: Okay.
[00:48:21] Gerard Donnelly: If you can just adjust this week to make that a 10k, that one.
[00:48:26] Abby Jorgensen: Okay, yeah.
[00:48:29] Abby Jorgensen: All right.
[00:48:33] Gerard Donnelly: Anybody else that you think that we need to discuss that you're worried about?
[00:48:38] Abby Jorgensen: Not really worried, but Nancy, I'm going to have a call with her tonight here.
[00:48:44] Abby Jorgensen: She says she's struggling to recover.
[00:48:48] Abby Jorgensen: Well, she was saying like her stats are lower.
[00:48:54] Abby Jorgensen: I don't know.
[00:48:55] Abby Jorgensen: I don't know if she's recovering or not recovering very well.
[00:48:59] Abby Jorgensen: Yeah.
[00:49:00] Abby Jorgensen: Yeah.
[00:49:00] Abby Jorgensen: Yeah.
[00:49:00] Abby Jorgensen: Yeah.
[00:49:01] Abby Jorgensen: Yeah.
[00:49:01] Abby Jorgensen: Yeah.
[00:49:01] Abby Jorgensen: I know.
[00:49:01] Abby Jorgensen: Yeah.
[00:49:01] Abby Jorgensen: Yeah.
[00:49:01] Abby Jorgensen: Okay.
[00:49:01] Abby Jorgensen: But she's, what, three weeks out from Kona, so I don't know what to – I told her that I could move her – move the Wednesday session the Thursday to give her an extra day, and then she's like, can we have a call?
[00:49:16] Abby Jorgensen: And I was like, yeah, figure.
[00:49:21] Gerard Donnelly: Yeah.
[00:49:22] Abby Jorgensen: Yeah, I mean – I just want to make sure her volume is okay for – Yeah.
[00:49:31] Abby Jorgensen: Because I mean, there was a point when she wanted more volume, and then I started to give her, and now she's like, I think that's too much now.
[00:49:39] Abby Jorgensen: And I was like, well, okay.
[00:49:42] Abby Jorgensen: Yeah.
[00:49:42] Abby Jorgensen: You wanted more, and then – Yeah, okay.
[00:49:49] Gerard Donnelly: I think – is she getting tired from her running?
[00:49:54] Abby Jorgensen: I mean, her runs – she always says her runs go fine.
[00:49:57] Abby Jorgensen: It's the bike.
[00:49:58] Abby Jorgensen: She says that she's just starting to dread the bike.
[00:50:02] Abby Jorgensen: But I just think she's overthinking, you know, she thought she should have been further along in the bike.
[00:50:09] Abby Jorgensen: She just keeps struggling with the bike, but her runs have been good off the bike, so it's hard.
[00:50:21] Gerard Donnelly: Is she improving with her pedaling?
[00:50:24] Gerard Donnelly: Yeah.
[00:50:24] Abby Jorgensen: Yeah, so on 9-12, she had 55% in Zone 2, and then this ride, she had 58%.
[00:50:33] Abby Jorgensen: So it's getting better, less time in Zone 1.
[00:50:40] Abby Jorgensen: But she likes to overanalyze everything, and if it's not perfect, in her eyes.
[00:50:49] Gerard Donnelly: What is going on?
[00:50:50] Gerard Donnelly: Why isn't that showing a percentage?
[00:50:55] Abby Jorgensen: It's still an hour under 90, isn't She was 25% the week before, so.
[00:51:02] Abby Jorgensen: That's quite an improvement, but still.
[00:51:05] Abby Jorgensen: Yeah.
[00:51:07] Abby Jorgensen: I think she's doing well.
[00:51:15] Gerard Donnelly: Certainly, she needs to be doing those, you know, one long ride, one intensity, and you've got to do it in the sweet spot, so that's okay.
[00:51:31] Gerard Donnelly: And, yeah, that ride there's all right.
[00:51:35] Gerard Donnelly: Nothing wrong with that.
[00:51:37] Gerard Donnelly: Okay.
[00:51:38] Abby Jorgensen: Sorry, that run there.
[00:51:40] Gerard Donnelly: But the three runs, I would probably spread them out a bit more if you had the opportunity to.
[00:51:46] Gerard Donnelly: But it's hard to do that because, look, she's doing a two-hour run at 180K, and then two days later, she's doing another two-hour run.
[00:51:55] Gerard Donnelly: That would be tough, Abby, I think.
[00:51:59] Gerard Donnelly: I would probably swap that to an hour and
[00:52:11] Gerard Donnelly: So she's getting the four rides in, which is fine.
[00:52:18] Gerard Donnelly: Yeah, I think you're doing a reasonably good job with that.
[00:52:21] Gerard Donnelly: That's absolutely fine.
[00:52:23] Gerard Donnelly: Happy birthday.
[00:52:28] Gerard Donnelly: Yeah, you know, this is a big day on Wednesday.
[00:52:34] Abby Jorgensen: told you it's a long session.
[00:52:37] Gerard Donnelly: Yep, and get an intuition right.
[00:52:40] Gerard Donnelly: That's fine.
[00:52:41] Gerard Donnelly: That's absolutely fine.
[00:52:43] Abby Jorgensen: If she wants to move it to Thursday, what would you put on Wednesday?
[00:52:52] Gerard Donnelly: Yeah, I would get it probably to do the run.
[00:53:01] Gerard Donnelly: It may be this 90-minute run there, and I'd move the ride to there, maybe.
[00:53:13] Gerard Donnelly: So, you know, you can put that there.
[00:53:15] Gerard Donnelly: We can change it back.
[00:53:17] Gerard Donnelly: Yeah.
[00:53:20] Gerard Donnelly: And then if you did that, then I would be moving the whole thing around, you know.
[00:53:27] Gerard Donnelly: So run there.
[00:53:28] Gerard Donnelly: Sorry.
[00:53:29] Gerard Donnelly: That's not what I wanted to do.
[00:53:33] Gerard Donnelly: Run there.
[00:53:34] Gerard Donnelly: It's hard to get a back-to-back run, though.
[00:53:36] Gerard Donnelly: She couldn't run.
[00:53:39] Gerard Donnelly: That's what I was – you could switch the run to tomorrow or today, tomorrow.
[00:53:44] Abby Jorgensen: Yeah, Tuesday, yeah.
[00:53:45] Abby Jorgensen: You have to do that.
[00:53:46] Gerard Donnelly: That's what I would do.
[00:53:48] Gerard Donnelly: That would be a better look, wouldn't it?
[00:53:50] Abby Jorgensen: And then maybe – I mean, she wants the day off because she got mad at me last week because I didn't give her a day off.
[00:53:57] Abby Jorgensen: It's not bad.
[00:53:58] Abby Jorgensen: I just was like, I need a day off.
[00:53:59] Abby Jorgensen: I'm like, okay.
[00:54:01] Abby Jorgensen: Yeah, well, I would say to a swim and bike on Saturday.
[00:54:05] Abby Jorgensen: Yeah.
[00:54:06] Abby Jorgensen: And that's it.
[00:54:08] Abby Jorgensen: What do you think?
[00:54:09] Abby Jorgensen: Yeah, that looks – I think that's what I had in my head at one point when I was looking at it earlier today.
[00:54:17] Gerard Donnelly: Yeah, you can try that or you can move it back to where you had it.
[00:54:19] Gerard Donnelly: And the good thing is – And then next week I'll do, what, a 60-minute FTP?
[00:54:29] Abby Jorgensen: Before she leaves, probably.
[00:54:30] Abby Jorgensen: Yes, yep.
[00:54:32] Gerard Donnelly: Or you can do it out there if you want.
[00:54:33] Gerard Donnelly: Out there probably to give her a better idea.
[00:54:35] Gerard Donnelly: Yeah, I'll be doing it here on the Saturday or the Sunday.
[00:54:39] Gerard Donnelly: Okay.
[00:54:42] Gerard Donnelly: I just noticed, Abby, don't forget to put coach's notes in.
[00:54:46] Gerard Donnelly: Okay.
[00:54:47] Gerard Donnelly: You've been doing that, haven't you?
[00:54:48] Abby Jorgensen: Yeah, with most athletes.
[00:54:50] Abby Jorgensen: I think with her I end up texting her like a little bit more needy than some of the other ones.
[00:54:56] Abby Jorgensen: It's really good for you to look back.
[00:54:57] Gerard Donnelly: can – and you can – if you have the coach's notes there, you can say, what did
[00:55:01] Gerard Donnelly: Can I schedule her for Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday, Friday?
[00:55:05] Gerard Donnelly: And then if you start moving it, then you can always check on the Monday.
[00:55:10] Gerard Donnelly: You know, if you and I have just moved stuff around, I was about to check your coach's notes to say, how did we have it before I interfered or before she interferes?
[00:55:22] Gerard Donnelly: And some people like her wouldn't change it until I asked you, but other athletes will change it on you without you knowing.
[00:55:29] Gerard Donnelly: And then you can check your coach's notes and go, that's not what I scheduled.
[00:55:33] Gerard Donnelly: How's it looking like that?
[00:55:36] Gerard Donnelly: So really be, I want you to be particular about everybody has to have coach's notes.
[00:55:42] Gerard Donnelly: Okay.
[00:55:43] Gerard Donnelly: Even though you're texting her, I know you're communicating, but it's really for us to make sure that we know when we look back, what were we planning for that person and what did they actually do?
[00:55:55] Gerard Donnelly: That makes sense to me.
[00:55:57] Gerard Donnelly: Yeah, because if we go back and go, what happened this week?
[00:56:01] Gerard Donnelly: How did she not do that?
[00:56:02] Gerard Donnelly: What, you know, and you could say, oh, in my coaches notes, I'd change my mind or something, you know, so.
[00:56:09] Gerard Donnelly: All right.
[00:56:10] Abby Jorgensen: Yep.
[00:56:13] Gerard Donnelly: Is it?
[00:56:14] Gerard Donnelly: Yeah, just hit me with anybody.
[00:56:17] Gerard Donnelly: Philippe, is he going all right?
[00:56:18] Gerard Donnelly: Yeah, yeah, he's good.
[00:56:20] Abby Jorgensen: He scheduled a 70.3 for next year.
[00:56:24] Abby Jorgensen: I don't think it's an Ironman one, but it's somewhere in Canada.
[00:56:27] Abby Jorgensen: Yeah.
[00:56:27] Abby Jorgensen: Good.
[00:56:30] Gerard Donnelly: Glenn's doing bustle turn, he?
[00:56:32] Abby Jorgensen: Yep.
[00:56:34] Gerard Donnelly: Yeah, but you feel like you're getting a long rise in to him?
[00:56:37] Abby Jorgensen: Yeah.
[00:56:38] Abby Jorgensen: Sometimes I feel like his expectations are too high, so I have to try to bring him back down to reality, but that's Glenn.
[00:56:50] Abby Jorgensen: I moved his swim because he woke up not feeling great this morning, so I just moved.
[00:56:54] Abby Jorgensen: It's a Wednesday.
[00:56:55] Gerard Donnelly: Yeah, that's great.
[00:56:57] Gerard Donnelly: Yeah, well, that looks fine next week.
[00:56:59] Gerard Donnelly: Same thing again.
[00:57:00] Gerard Donnelly: Start to do.
[00:57:01] Gerard Donnelly: Some fun rides, you know, those bunch, five-hour-plus rides.
[00:57:10] Gerard Donnelly: Good.
[00:57:11] Gerard Donnelly: Okay.
[00:57:11] Gerard Donnelly: Blair?
[00:57:12] Gerard Donnelly: Blair going all right?
[00:57:13] Abby Jorgensen: Yeah, he kind of took last week off after that big cycle event, and then this week we're going to try to get some testing in, get him back on a schedule.
[00:57:23] Abby Jorgensen: Yep.
[00:57:24] Gerard Donnelly: I meant to ask you about Michaela.
[00:57:26] Gerard Donnelly: What does she want to do now?
[00:57:28] Gerard Donnelly: I'm talking to her tonight at some point.
[00:57:31] Abby Jorgensen: Yep.
[00:57:31] Abby Jorgensen: I was like, after, I don't know what time she, I think she just got up.
[00:57:35] Abby Jorgensen: Yep.
[00:57:35] Abby Jorgensen: Still in Sydney, so.
[00:57:37] Gerard Donnelly: Yep.
[00:57:40] Gerard Donnelly: Well, that's super exciting, the job you've done with her.
[00:57:42] Gerard Donnelly: Really well done.
[00:57:43] Gerard Donnelly: Thank you.
[00:57:44] Gerard Donnelly: I know we've jumped around a bit today, but anybody else that we need to?
[00:57:50] Abby Jorgensen: No, I think that's...
[00:57:54] Abby Jorgensen: Okay.
[00:57:55] Abby Jorgensen: Yeah.
[00:57:55] Abby Jorgensen: Let's jump on you.
[00:57:59] Gerard Donnelly: How are you going?
[00:58:01] Gerard Donnelly: Okay.
[00:58:01] Gerard Donnelly: Okay.
[00:58:01] Gerard Donnelly: I mean, I feel good.
[00:58:02] Abby Jorgensen: This morning was rough with the Fathom.
[00:58:06] Abby Jorgensen: I mean, I knew it would be, but.
[00:58:12] Gerard Donnelly: So how did you execute, Coach?
[00:58:16] Abby Jorgensen: Did you get ahead of yourself?
[00:58:18] Abby Jorgensen: I might have a little bit.
[00:58:23] Gerard Donnelly: I think it was, I mean, I don't know.
[00:58:25] Abby Jorgensen: That's hilarious.
[00:58:26] Abby Jorgensen: I where to start.
[00:58:28] Abby Jorgensen: I knew it wasn't going to be the same, but I also, I don't know.
[00:58:34] Gerard Donnelly: What was your last one before we?
[00:58:38] Abby Jorgensen: 191 was like my peak 20.
[00:58:42] Abby Jorgensen: So like 81 was my FTP or 186 maybe.
[00:58:47] Abby Jorgensen: 181 is my outdoor one.
[00:58:49] Abby Jorgensen: So I was like, maybe if I start around that.
[00:58:53] Abby Jorgensen: Yeah, was just too much, wasn't it?
[00:58:55] Gerard Donnelly: Yeah.
[00:58:55] Gerard Donnelly: Yeah.
[00:58:56] Gerard Donnelly: My heart rate spiked really fast too.
[00:58:58] Abby Jorgensen: Yeah.
[00:58:59] Abby Jorgensen: Yeah.
[00:59:00] Abby Jorgensen: Yeah.
[00:59:01] Gerard Donnelly: Yeah.
[00:59:01] Gerard Donnelly: So your cadence was good.
[00:59:04] Gerard Donnelly: You tell your athletes, just be conservative, and there's no expectation of 190s, 200s.
[00:59:12] Gerard Donnelly: It's just a line in the sand to say, well, okay, we're starting from this point, so don't make it harder for yourself, all right?
[00:59:20] Gerard Donnelly: So you need to think about that when you're coaching your athletes.
[00:59:24] Gerard Donnelly: Hey, we're not asking you to ride 190 or 185.
[00:59:28] Gerard Donnelly: We just want you to see how you go.
[00:59:31] Gerard Donnelly: And if you wanted to start at 160, I would say this to athletes.
[00:59:36] Gerard Donnelly: If you want to start at 160, be my guest and finish at 200.
[00:59:40] Gerard Donnelly: It's okay.
[00:59:41] Gerard Donnelly: Just, you know, we're starting again.
[00:59:44] Gerard Donnelly: Yeah, I just didn't know.
[00:59:47] Abby Jorgensen: I considered, I was like, 175, one, I don't What point did you get to the 10-minute mark and went, oh, Yeah, pretty much.
[01:00:01] Gerard Donnelly: 184, 177, 175, so it wasn't too bad.
[01:00:08] Gerard Donnelly: You rallied at the end.
[01:00:10] Gerard Donnelly: Yeah, I tried to consider two minutes, and then I changed my mind at the last minute.
[01:00:18] Abby Jorgensen: That's okay.
[01:00:19] Gerard Donnelly: So plug that into your settings, and as always, if you find it, you know, have you done that yet?
[01:00:28] Gerard Donnelly: Have you changed your settings?
[01:00:29] Gerard Donnelly: I don't think so.
[01:00:32] Gerard Donnelly: So if you find that, you know, it's still a bit of a battle, because it's, you you're getting back to routine now, but back to structure.
[01:00:38] Gerard Donnelly: So I'm keen for you to start, you know, really building your running, and we want to kind of get you to be running four times a week just to get your running load going again, and we'll just gradually build your writing where we're not trying to do any intensity, Abby.
[01:00:57] Gerard Donnelly: We're just trying to keep your aerobic fitness going, where we're in that zone three.
[01:01:01] Gerard Donnelly: Three, area, zone two, zone three.
[01:01:05] Gerard Donnelly: You know, that's kind of all we're after.
[01:01:09] Gerard Donnelly: And we don't need to be doing any long rides yet.
[01:01:12] Gerard Donnelly: There's no, you know, it's just not, the running's where we want to actually get you to, you know, if you can run at least, you know, three times where you're running over an hour, and this we want to build up, and then just get one of them off the bike if you can.
[01:01:30] Gerard Donnelly: So, especially on the days where you're not working.
[01:01:33] Gerard Donnelly: So, you know, that's long enough.
[01:01:35] Gerard Donnelly: Just have fun on your bike ride.
[01:01:36] Gerard Donnelly: If you're going outside, just, you know, just don't be worried about anything except enjoying having a bike ride.
[01:01:45] Gerard Donnelly: Okay?
[01:01:45] Gerard Donnelly: I know, I need a road bike.
[01:01:48] Abby Jorgensen: Yeah, well, can't drive bike's fine.
[01:01:50] Abby Jorgensen: I know.
[01:01:52] Gerard Donnelly: You know, just get in there and just enjoy the fact that I'm, you know, if the weather's nice and it's not too windy or not too cold, but jump inside if it's, if it's no good.
[01:02:00] Gerard Donnelly: Okay.
[01:02:01] Gerard Donnelly: Um, remind me, have you got Zwift?
[01:02:05] Abby Jorgensen: Yeah.
[01:02:06] Abby Jorgensen: Yep.
[01:02:07] Abby Jorgensen: Yep.
[01:02:08] Abby Jorgensen: Yeah.
[01:02:09] Abby Jorgensen: Contemplating getting the kicker over the snap, but waiting for my tax return.
[01:02:17] Abby Jorgensen: Yeah.
[01:02:17] Abby Jorgensen: Okay.
[01:02:19] Gerard Donnelly: Okay.
[01:02:19] Gerard Donnelly: You all right with that?
[01:02:20] Gerard Donnelly: Yeah.
[01:02:21] Abby Jorgensen: I just got to get into, I mean, I start work tomorrow.
[01:02:24] Abby Jorgensen: It's like seven to six.
[01:02:25] Abby Jorgensen: So I'm just trying to get back into a routine, I think.
[01:02:29] Abby Jorgensen: But I'll have three days, three to four days off during the week, so.
[01:02:33] Abby Jorgensen: Yeah.
[01:02:34] Abby Jorgensen: Just keep me updated with that.
[01:02:35] Gerard Donnelly: If I've got that right, hopefully.
[01:02:37] Gerard Donnelly: Yeah.
[01:02:38] Abby Jorgensen: I don't know.
[01:02:38] Abby Jorgensen: Saturday, I have to go in early.
[01:02:40] Abby Jorgensen: I don't know how late I'll be there, but I should, I mean, it's Saturday, so I should be able to get the ride in after work.
[01:02:47] Abby Jorgensen: So it's not a mission.
[01:02:50] Gerard Donnelly: Um, just, yeah, I can change any of that.
[01:02:53] Gerard Donnelly: So if you, you know, if, if you know that you've got 90 minutes or two hours, just let me know, cause it's, it's so helpful.
[01:03:00] Gerard Donnelly: Yeah.
[01:03:02] Gerard Donnelly: With this new schedule you're going to have, so.
[01:03:04] Gerard Donnelly: Yeah, it's a change for me too.
[01:03:06] Gerard Donnelly: Yeah, we'll work it out.
[01:03:08] Gerard Donnelly: Yeah.
[01:03:09] Gerard Donnelly: It looks pretty light on for you, I know that, but let's just get back into the routine.
[01:03:13] Gerard Donnelly: Yeah, just need routine.
[01:03:14] Abby Jorgensen: It's fine.
[01:03:14] Abby Jorgensen: Like, I don't need, I mean, I just want to, you know, up my running and tons of volume right now.
[01:03:23] Abby Jorgensen: Although my body, I'm a volume , I guess.
[01:03:28] Gerard Donnelly: Yes, well, just, you know, one day at a time.
[01:03:32] Gerard Donnelly: That's, you know.
[01:03:33] Abby Jorgensen: The swim has felt good for some reason.
[01:03:36] Abby Jorgensen: I don't know why I swim that fast in the open water, but.
[01:03:39] Gerard Donnelly: I want the whole thing to feel like it's, you know, enjoyable.
[01:03:43] Gerard Donnelly: It has to be something you want to get up to, to do each day.
[01:03:46] Gerard Donnelly: And I don't want it to be a chore.
[01:03:48] Gerard Donnelly: I want it to be, I don't want it be had this, oh, I have to hit these numbers.
[01:03:52] Gerard Donnelly: We're not, we're not kind of worried about that right now.
[01:03:55] Gerard Donnelly: It's, it's just getting back the routine.
[01:03:57] Gerard Donnelly: Okay.
[01:03:58] Gerard Donnelly: Yeah.
[01:04:00] Abby Jorgensen: Sounds good.
[01:04:01] Abby Jorgensen: Yeah.
[01:04:02] Abby Jorgensen: And I'm supposed to have like two-hour lunch breaks too, so I can lift some weights, or if I need to do something, run.
[01:04:09] Abby Jorgensen: There's a trail near the work, so I can do some stuff.
[01:04:15] Gerard Donnelly: Yeah, okay.
[01:04:19] Gerard Donnelly: All right, good.
[01:04:22] Gerard Donnelly: Thank you for that.
[01:04:23] Gerard Donnelly: Sorry, have to rush off.
[01:04:24] Gerard Donnelly: No, you're fine.
[01:04:25] Gerard Donnelly: I will call Nancy and get that done.
[01:04:29] Abby Jorgensen: Good stuff.
[01:04:30] Abby Jorgensen: All right, thanks, Abby.
[01:04:31] Abby Jorgensen: Yep, bye.
[01:04:32] Gerard Donnelly: Bye.
[01:04:44] Gerard Donnelly: Good morning.
[01:04:46] Gerard Donnelly: I'm dreading this.
[01:04:48] Gerard Donnelly: Oh, no.
[01:04:49] Gerard Donnelly: No, it's not that bad.
[01:04:52] Gerard Donnelly: No, no.
[01:04:53] Gerard Donnelly: I need to listen to me saying, not that bad, but just need to have a chat.
[01:04:56] Gerard Donnelly: Okay.
[01:04:57] Gerard Donnelly: Oh, God.
[01:04:58] Gerard Donnelly: Tell me.
[01:04:59] Gerard Donnelly: Tell me.
[01:04:59] Gerard Donnelly: Oh, he's already.
[01:05:02] Gerard Donnelly: He's so pent up that, and I totally appreciate and understand that being that close to the line is often what achieves the success, but I'm just already worried about something really bad happening to him, whether it's his health or an accident.
[01:05:24] Gerard Donnelly: He just, he doesn't, I think you probably know this, he doesn't manage the pressure and the stress that he puts on himself in terms of his expectations and his goals, and it undermines him.
[01:05:37] Gerard Donnelly: He's freely horrible to live with, which is not particularly helpful, but the greater fear is that something catastrophic happens to him as a result of him not managing his stress, and he won't listen to me, he will listen to you, and so I'm just reaching out.
[01:05:53] Gerard Donnelly: Fantastic, Mel, thanks.
[01:05:55] Gerard Donnelly: Did you realise the conversation I had with him last week about his 1 in 20 performance?
[01:06:01] Gerard Donnelly: No.
[01:06:02] Gerard Donnelly: Negative he was with his summary, his own summary.
[01:06:08] Gerard Donnelly: I almost fell off the chair.
[01:06:10] Gerard Donnelly: was like, Joe, that's the third fastest you've ever done since you've been doing it.
[01:06:16] Gerard Donnelly: You were 18 seconds or 12 seconds off your all-time PB from 2018.
[01:06:24] Gerard Donnelly: I don't know what else to say.
[01:06:26] Gerard Donnelly: Seven years younger.
[01:06:27] Gerard Donnelly: You know, the day wasn't particularly fast.
[01:06:31] Gerard Donnelly: There was a headwind, and normally it's a different wind.
[01:06:34] Gerard Donnelly: So he got held up by a car and by another rider.
[01:06:38] Gerard Donnelly: I said, actually, it's probably close to your PB all-time if we take that into consideration.
[01:06:44] Gerard Donnelly: But I said to Joe, you've got really bad perspective.
[01:06:48] Gerard Donnelly: So we had a really big conversation, and I ended up emailing backwards and forwards some data for him.
[01:06:56] Gerard Donnelly: And then he just kept saying some really negative things every time.
[01:07:00] Gerard Donnelly: And I said, oh, no, we have to.
[01:07:02] Gerard Donnelly: We have to talk this out, you know, you're too...
[01:07:05] Gerard Donnelly: So I wonder if it's time to tell him that you need to actually speak to someone to change his headspace, because he's not talking to me at all, and he doesn't, but he withdraws as he gets more stressed, and becomes more of an arsehole, to be honest, and I accept that that probably helps him to perform in that space, but it's very close to the line, and he had a spill this morning.
[01:07:26] Gerard Donnelly: It wasn't a major one, but he said, was just wet, and I went out of the corner, but I just can't help but see if...
[01:07:32] Gerard Donnelly: Yeah, but is that because you're angry?
[01:07:34] Gerard Donnelly: Like, he's already in an angry headspace, and that's pretty scary to watch, because people don't make good decisions when they're angry.
[01:07:43] Gerard Donnelly: No, your perception is so unbelievably spot on, and he's lucky that he didn't hurt himself today, if that's what's happened, because this is a pattern that, you know, he just, he overshoots the mark, I'm not talking about physical, I'm talking about his...
[01:08:02] Gerard Donnelly: Mental is, he's expecting something that's, you know, way beyond, I don't know, I don't know what he's expecting, but he's doing a really good job from where he's come from with his crashes.
[01:08:14] Gerard Donnelly: He's in the best form, Mel, that he's ever been in.
[01:08:18] Gerard Donnelly: And I'm trying to get that across to him, but he's not, he's not actually.
[01:08:21] Gerard Donnelly: It's not landing.
[01:08:22] Gerard Donnelly: No, it's, he's just, it's always.
[01:08:25] Gerard Donnelly: It's scary that there's an element of, maybe this is a last gasp, in terms of getting this, like he's just getting more fatigue every time there's some sort of accident or backward step.
[01:08:37] Gerard Donnelly: And I suspect that's adding to the pressure of, you know, the home world and all that sort of stuff.
[01:08:45] Gerard Donnelly: But it's pretty, it's scary to watch from the outside because we all know it can go wrong for a whole lot of reasons.
[01:08:51] Gerard Donnelly: But, I mean, I listen to what you're telling, if you're not even landing with him, because usually you do, and as I said, he didn't, he's not.
[01:09:02] Gerard Donnelly: Telling me about those conversations, but that is, Gerard will tell you, know, it's very, and I don't mean to sound disparaging, but it's very typically male, he goes into the cave and just ruminates.
[01:09:13] Gerard Donnelly: It's classic.
[01:09:14] Gerard Donnelly: It's absolutely classic.
[01:09:15] Gerard Donnelly: I'm dealing with it all the time with the blokes.
[01:09:18] Gerard Donnelly: The girls are so much easier to coach.
[01:09:20] Gerard Donnelly: It's fantastic.
[01:09:22] Gerard Donnelly: I'd love to have all girls because they tell me what...
[01:09:29] Gerard Donnelly: I I don't think a lot of girls have.
[01:09:30] Gerard Donnelly: I think he's mentally tougher, but mentally harder on himself in a way that is self-destructive.
[01:09:37] Gerard Donnelly: Yeah, but the point we're talking about is being open and transparent.
[01:09:42] Gerard Donnelly: That's why the girls are so easy to coach because they let you know, you know, exactly how they're feeling, which is, that's the only way you can coach people is, well, how are you feeling?
[01:09:52] Gerard Donnelly: But, you know, so really great that you've reached out.
[01:09:59] Gerard Donnelly: Did he...
[01:09:59] Gerard Donnelly: Sounds like we need to get him in to see the sports psychologist.
[01:10:01] Gerard Donnelly: to ...
[01:10:02] Gerard Donnelly: ...
[01:10:02] Gerard Donnelly: He's a he's
[01:10:06] Gerard Donnelly: Yeah, but I think if I come from an angle of Ash Barty, I can just run through them, you know, they ended up getting the best results because they went and saw people to help them perform better from a performance thing.
[01:10:22] Gerard Donnelly: If he knows it's a performance thing, he'll do it for sure.
[01:10:25] Gerard Donnelly: Well, I think if he knows, if he, I also think, I think I agree with that, but I also think if he hears you say to him, mate, I'm listening to you and you're actually destroying your own performances and your own prospects because of what's going on in your head, I think that's sort thing that would pick him because, let's face it, Joe pursues every 1% that he can in order to get the results.
[01:10:47] Gerard Donnelly: But he's always, he's not good at mental health awareness and space and he can be very flippant about it and, you know, I feel a little bit ill of my gut about where this is going.
[01:11:01] Gerard Donnelly: Yes, it's good.
[01:11:02] Gerard Donnelly: Whether it's just the disappointment or something disastrous, I can say either of them.
[01:11:07] Gerard Donnelly: And that's also a change from his efforts, right?
[01:11:09] Gerard Donnelly: No.
[01:11:10] Gerard Donnelly: Always a possibility.
[01:11:12] Gerard Donnelly: And look, Mel, the biggest thing is because the world titles, that's the big change.
[01:11:19] Gerard Donnelly: Whereas every other year, it's just the, I shouldn't say run-of-the-mill national titles, but that's what it's become for him because he's so used to winning.
[01:11:31] Gerard Donnelly: He's obsessed about it.
[01:11:32] Gerard Donnelly: Yeah.
[01:11:33] Gerard Donnelly: He's obsessed to get it.
[01:11:34] Gerard Donnelly: Yeah.
[01:11:34] Gerard Donnelly: I know that.
[01:11:34] Gerard Donnelly: And look, this is, you know, it's like it's the end of the world.
[01:11:38] Gerard Donnelly: The world championships are only going to be here once every, you know, the last time it was 2015 in Perth, I think you probably remember.
[01:11:44] Gerard Donnelly: Yeah.
[01:11:44] Gerard Donnelly: And he won't do it.
[01:11:45] Gerard Donnelly: He won't do it again for a week.
[01:11:48] Gerard Donnelly: No.
[01:11:48] Gerard Donnelly: So there's an honour to desperation, as I said, which is equivalent to dangerous.
[01:11:53] Gerard Donnelly: Yeah.
[01:11:53] Gerard Donnelly: And look, a lot of the podcasts we're doing, he listens to our podcast.
[01:11:56] Gerard Donnelly: And I've been actually.
[01:11:57] Gerard Donnelly: I know he does.
[01:11:57] Gerard Donnelly: I've been preaching that, you know, you.
[01:12:02] Gerard Donnelly: And even I went so far as to tell a whole podcast on how  of a person I was for a whole podcast when I was, you know, professional triathlete.
[01:12:13] Gerard Donnelly: And, you know, I was doing that intentionally for guys like Joe who are going to the extreme.
[01:12:21] Gerard Donnelly: It's not healthy.
[01:12:23] Gerard Donnelly: I just don't think he would think it applies to him.
[01:12:25] Gerard Donnelly: I think there's an element of willingness to listen.
[01:12:29] Gerard Donnelly: But it doesn't apply to him sort of thing.
[01:12:31] Gerard Donnelly: He couldn't possibly be that weak.
[01:12:34] Gerard Donnelly: I've got some things that I really appreciate.
[01:12:37] Gerard Donnelly: I really appreciate your calling me back and being prepared to listen to you.
[01:12:40] Gerard Donnelly: No, no, no.
[01:12:41] Gerard Donnelly: You know what's best for him more than anybody.
[01:12:44] Gerard Donnelly: And that's what's important.
[01:12:45] Gerard Donnelly: That'll help me be a better coach, Mel.
[01:12:48] Gerard Donnelly: I really appreciate it.
[01:12:49] Gerard Donnelly: stuff.
[01:12:50] Gerard Donnelly: I hope things get better in your world.
[01:12:53] Gerard Donnelly: Well, it will after World Chams.
[01:12:55] Gerard Donnelly: He'll be an arsehole to it.
[01:12:56] Gerard Donnelly: But it's okay.
[01:12:57] Gerard Donnelly: We'll ride that way.
[01:12:57] Gerard Donnelly: I'll put it that way.
[01:13:00] Gerard Donnelly: Hey, how are you going?
[01:13:02] Gerard Donnelly: Yeah, okay, thank you.
[01:13:03] Gerard Donnelly: How are you doing now?
[01:13:05] Gerard Donnelly: Don't you dare change the topic.
[01:13:08] Gerard Donnelly: I haven't been having cardiac surgery.
[01:13:10] Gerard Donnelly: Yeah, don't worry about that.
[01:13:11] Gerard Donnelly: That's pretty scary.
[01:13:12] Gerard Donnelly: Yeah, are you still running?
[01:13:14] Gerard Donnelly: I'm not going to.
[01:13:15] Gerard Donnelly: Of course.
[01:13:15] Gerard Donnelly: Yeah, have you got any of, are you doing Melbourne?
[01:13:17] Gerard Donnelly: Are you doing anything to do with that?
[01:13:18] Gerard Donnelly: I just, I shift, I closed down my business.
[01:13:21] Gerard Donnelly: I made it to a new job last year, and I sort of hoped this was my year for running, but actually it's been my career, so.
[01:13:27] Gerard Donnelly: Yes.
[01:13:28] Gerard Donnelly: Too busy.
[01:13:29] Gerard Donnelly: So I just have to accept that, that sort of taken a little bit of priority.
[01:13:33] Gerard Donnelly: Still running, still running well, but not racing at all because, you know, I just, I can't do it all.
[01:13:40] Gerard Donnelly: It's not priorities, but I just can't do it all, and I can't bury myself trying to do it all.
[01:13:43] Gerard Donnelly: So getting a little bit smarter, a little bit more accepting of that is the rally major.
[01:13:47] Gerard Donnelly: That's okay.
[01:13:48] Gerard Donnelly: I'm still happy to be running well.
[01:13:49] Gerard Donnelly: So if I don't, if I don't achieve the race results, it doesn't really matter.
[01:13:53] Gerard Donnelly: No, no, no.
[01:13:54] Gerard Donnelly: That's a great attitude.
[01:13:56] Gerard Donnelly: As long as you're keeping yourself healthy and fit, that's, that's all, that's all that matters.
[01:14:00] Gerard Donnelly: grateful to be doing that.
[01:14:01] Gerard Donnelly: But now.
[01:14:01] Gerard Donnelly: But now.
[01:14:02] Gerard Donnelly: now.
[01:14:02] Gerard Donnelly: Now, tell me about you.
[01:14:03] Gerard Donnelly: Are you feeling good?
[01:14:05] Gerard Donnelly: Yeah, look, I just had the cardiologist interview yesterday afternoon, which was really great.
[01:14:11] Gerard Donnelly: And he's sort of saying he's really happy with how it all went.
[01:14:14] Gerard Donnelly: And obviously, I've got a lot of health issues with cardiovascular disease that I'm stuck with.
[01:14:24] Gerard Donnelly: But he said, the good thing is you're fit and healthy and you're in a better position than anybody I've ever known.
[01:14:32] Gerard Donnelly: Because of your fitness.
[01:14:35] Gerard Donnelly: You've got an unfortunate genetic cardiovascular gene that has put you in this position.
[01:14:42] Gerard Donnelly: And you're to have to deal with that for the rest of your life.
[01:14:45] Gerard Donnelly: You're not going to be able to be the athlete you once were.
[01:14:49] Gerard Donnelly: But I'm saying to him, I don't really care as long as I can still train.
[01:14:54] Gerard Donnelly: I've got past that, Mel.
[01:14:56] Gerard Donnelly: I was a, you know, win-at-all-cost person.
[01:15:00] Gerard Donnelly: But I've kind of, I've had to.
[01:15:04] Gerard Donnelly: It's sort of nice to get there, though, isn't it, when you sort of go, that's okay?
[01:15:07] Gerard Donnelly: It is.
[01:15:08] Gerard Donnelly: It wasn't okay when they first told me what was wrong with me, but I've had some dark moments myself, but I've been able to talk to people.
[01:15:17] Gerard Donnelly: But yeah, thanks for asking.
[01:15:19] Gerard Donnelly: But the good thing is I'm still here instead of being, you know, I'm going to a funeral this afternoon.
[01:15:25] Gerard Donnelly: I could have easily died with a heart attack.
[01:15:27] Gerard Donnelly: That's what they've told me.
[01:15:28] Gerard Donnelly: I'm lucky to be alive.
[01:15:29] Gerard Donnelly: Yeah, right.
[01:15:30] Gerard Donnelly: Amazing.
[01:15:31] Gerard Donnelly: Wow.
[01:15:32] Gerard Donnelly: Are you feeling better in yourself?
[01:15:35] Gerard Donnelly: No.
[01:15:36] Gerard Donnelly: He asked me that yesterday.
[01:15:37] Gerard Donnelly: said, oh, the last three years has been, I just feel not myself.
[01:15:41] Gerard Donnelly: And now I know why.
[01:15:43] Gerard Donnelly: So I can actually, I can accept that.
[01:15:45] Gerard Donnelly: I just couldn't work out what was wrong with me.
[01:15:47] Gerard Donnelly: And I kept pushing people, testing, getting tests.
[01:15:49] Gerard Donnelly: I'm saying, there's something not right.
[01:15:51] Gerard Donnelly: This is not normal for me.
[01:15:53] Gerard Donnelly: I can't even ride my bike very fast.
[01:15:55] Gerard Donnelly: And I'm training, you know, as well as I used to.
[01:15:58] Gerard Donnelly: And all of a sudden, it's just three years of this.
[01:16:01] Gerard Donnelly: You know, it's just
[01:16:02] Gerard Donnelly: And now I know that it's, you know, I've had four blocked arteries and a lung clot and leg clots.
[01:16:09] Gerard Donnelly: know, they're all related to the one thing, which is, you know, really poor calcium and bloody cholesterol levels.
[01:16:20] Gerard Donnelly: So it's been a bit of eye-opener.
[01:16:23] Gerard Donnelly: But I'm grateful that I'm still here and able to function.
[01:16:27] Gerard Donnelly: So it's given me good perspective.
[01:16:30] Gerard Donnelly: Yeah, well, full credit to you.
[01:16:33] Gerard Donnelly: And, I mean, it sucks a bit, let's face it.
[01:16:35] Gerard Donnelly: But great attitude.
[01:16:37] Gerard Donnelly: I've got no choice, Mel.
[01:16:39] Gerard Donnelly: I can't have anything.
[01:16:39] Gerard Donnelly: No, no, that's right.
[01:16:40] Gerard Donnelly: We all, you know, rent out certain cards and make the most of it.
[01:16:44] Gerard Donnelly: And, you I always say to people, there's nothing quite like a funeral to remind you of.
[01:16:51] Gerard Donnelly: That's right.
[01:16:52] Gerard Donnelly: I had one last Monday.
[01:16:53] Gerard Donnelly: I'm having one today.
[01:16:54] Gerard Donnelly: I was like, oh, God, what's going on?
[01:16:55] Gerard Donnelly: Normally you're going to weddings, not funerals.
[01:16:57] Gerard Donnelly: Yeah, no, no.
[01:16:58] Gerard Donnelly: Different chapter.
[01:17:00] Gerard Donnelly: Yes, All right.
[01:17:02] Gerard Donnelly: Go ahead.
[01:17:03] Gerard Donnelly: Thanks so much for reaching out, Mel.
[01:17:04] Gerard Donnelly: I really appreciate when you do this.
[01:17:06] Gerard Donnelly: appreciate your time.
[01:17:07] Gerard Donnelly: Okay.
[01:17:07] Gerard Donnelly: Talk soon.
[01:17:08] Gerard Donnelly: Bye.
[01:17:57] Gerard Donnelly: Thank you.
[01:19:07] Gerard Donnelly: Thank you.
[01:19:36] Gerard Donnelly: Do you want X before your call?
[01:19:38] Gerard Donnelly: No, I've changed it.
[01:19:40] Gerard Donnelly: Right, are you coming with me?
[01:19:42] Gerard Donnelly: Yep.
[01:19:42] Gerard Donnelly: right.
[01:19:43] Gerard Donnelly: you want X?
[01:19:43] Gerard Donnelly: Yep.
[01:21:10] Gerard Donnelly: Thank you.
[01:21:42] Gerard Donnelly: Thank you.
[01:22:12] Gerard Donnelly: Thank you.
[01:22:47] Gerard Donnelly: Thank you.
[01:23:16] Gerard Donnelly: So how did you start the conversation?
[01:23:37] Gerard Donnelly: Thank you.
[01:23:57] Gerard Donnelly: Thank you.
[01:24:02] Gerard Donnelly: We talking about Fathom, Gerard Donnelly, Abby Jorgensen, and TriVelo Coaching.
[01:24:14] Gerard Donnelly: We were talking about Fathom.
[01:24:35] Gerard Donnelly: So it says a couple of things he said, you know, look at the video and drop my name on.
[01:24:49] Gerard Donnelly: So I leave comments, and I want to get to do anything, so I'll stop going.
[01:24:57] Gerard Donnelly: And then you do a video, and then just say what you want to do a video, and I'll...
[01:25:02] Gerard Donnelly: We were about Fathom, and I think we were talking about Fathom, and I think we were talking about Fathom.
[01:25:41] Gerard Donnelly: What do you do?
[01:25:43] Gerard Donnelly: Well, see, I'm just going to use the phone to sum it up, and I think that's good.
[01:26:00] Gerard Donnelly: Is it just happening?
[01:26:07] Gerard Donnelly: Is it Christmas or was it just the last couple of weeks before John died?
[01:26:12] Gerard Donnelly: No, was Paul's style.
[01:26:14] Gerard Donnelly: Right, Paul's style.
[01:26:22] Gerard Donnelly: I didn't hear Paul on first week.
[01:26:26] Gerard Donnelly: I think I've heard of him.
[01:26:37] Gerard Donnelly: He was already thinking for a speaker.
[01:26:41] Gerard Donnelly: I think.
[01:26:46] Gerard Donnelly: I didn't see him.
[01:26:48] Gerard Donnelly: I didn't see him.
[01:26:49] Gerard Donnelly: I didn't him.
[01:26:50] Gerard Donnelly: Okay.
[01:26:51] Gerard Donnelly: No problem.
[01:26:53] Gerard Donnelly: No problem.
[01:26:54] Gerard Donnelly: No No problem.
[01:26:59] Gerard Donnelly: No problem.
[01:27:00] Gerard Donnelly: problem.
[01:27:02] Gerard Donnelly: No problem.
[01:27:14] Gerard Donnelly: So when you talk to me about this person, can remember what Paul's talked about?
[01:27:39] Gerard Donnelly: No, I'm trying to suggest what you do with this information.
[01:27:44] Gerard Donnelly: Yeah, when you do it, you tell Paul that he's coaching.
[01:27:48] Gerard Donnelly: It's like getting attention to detail.
[01:27:52] Gerard Donnelly: Yeah, but when you've met with Paul for an hour and a half, and you've got a reach of the athlete, he has any image that he wants that he's not reading the comments.
[01:28:02] Gerard Donnelly: You've only got a feeling that it is in trouble, but you know, don't be responding to your story.
[01:28:09] Gerard Donnelly: Yeah.
[01:28:09] Gerard Donnelly: So I'll pull up and say, well, that's the need, that's all.
[01:28:12] Gerard Donnelly: Yeah.
[01:28:13] Gerard Donnelly: You know, then you could.
[01:28:18] Gerard Donnelly: That's the only thing that, when I talk about everything, that leads to the service.
[01:28:30] Gerard Donnelly: It just doesn't have a very good treatment.
[01:28:32] Gerard Donnelly: Probably.
[01:28:35] Gerard Donnelly: It's essentially more scary.
[01:28:38] Gerard Donnelly: I don't know if that leads to service.
[01:28:42] Gerard Donnelly: That's right.
[01:28:44] Gerard Donnelly: Yeah, Bill.
[01:28:45] Gerard Donnelly: Stephen.
[01:28:47] Gerard Donnelly: Reading.
[01:28:49] Gerard Donnelly: Why is it our reading?
[01:28:52] Gerard Donnelly: That's all right.
[01:28:54] Gerard Donnelly: We're gonna crash.
[01:28:56] Gerard Donnelly: What was like, girl?
[01:28:59] Gerard Donnelly: And then?
[01:29:04] Gerard Donnelly: You know, at any point, don't know what any of my athletes are doing.
[01:29:11] Gerard Donnelly: What happens with that?
[01:29:13] Gerard Donnelly: Do you think that school is too busy if it doesn't pay attention?
[01:29:18] Gerard Donnelly: It could be a memory thing, not a weapon.
[01:29:42] Gerard Donnelly: Well, when you discuss this, we discuss it with Jordan?
[01:29:48] Gerard Donnelly: Sorry, Jordan.
[01:29:49] Gerard Donnelly: Thank you.
[01:29:54] Gerard Donnelly: Thank you.
[01:30:02] Gerard Donnelly: I did.

[01:30:24] Gerard Donnelly: Last time we said we didn't want to learn about it.
[01:30:30] Gerard Donnelly: Yeah, we didn't want to talk to you time.
[01:30:32] Gerard Donnelly: didn't get too busy.
[01:30:46] Gerard Donnelly: If it wasn't at all, if you were more comfortable saying this to Matt and Andrew, it makes some difference.
[01:30:58] Gerard Donnelly: It's not business.
[01:30:59] Gerard Donnelly: Yeah, no.
[01:31:01] Gerard Donnelly: I'll just talk to you next
[01:31:02] Gerard Donnelly: Hello, everyone.

[01:31:49] Gerard Donnelly: No.
