## Transcript

[00:00:00] Abby Jorgensen: It's been a pretty chill day after I got done swimming, and it's been actually really nice weather here today.
[00:00:06] Abby Jorgensen: Not too hot?
[00:00:08] Abby Jorgensen: No, 70s.
[00:00:11] Gerard Donnelly: Fantastic.
[00:00:13] Gerard Donnelly: Handle that, can't you?
[00:00:15] Gerard Donnelly: Yeah, I can.
[00:00:20] Gerard Donnelly: So nice, easy spin today?
[00:00:23] Abby Jorgensen: Yeah, I just jumped on the trainer because I was here this morning and got that out of the way.
[00:00:27] Abby Jorgensen: And then went out to the water.
[00:00:31] Abby Jorgensen: How was your open water swim?
[00:00:34] Gerard Donnelly: It was all right.
[00:00:36] Abby Jorgensen: I've experienced some nausea today while swimming.
[00:00:40] Abby Jorgensen: I get motion sickness easily, so I don't know if that was the case or what.
[00:00:46] Abby Jorgensen: Yep, yep.
[00:00:47] Gerard Donnelly: Can you take any anti-nausea seasick tablets?
[00:00:52] Gerard Donnelly: I can, yeah.
[00:00:53] Abby Jorgensen: I was telling my friend I need to find some of the non-drowsy ones because I was like, I don't want to experience that.
[00:00:59] Abby Jorgensen: I don't know.
[00:01:05] Gerard Donnelly: It didn't stop you from swimming, or I would get through it okay?
[00:01:11] Gerard Donnelly: Yeah, I stopped for a second and gathered myself a couple times.
[00:01:17] Abby Jorgensen: Fitness-wise, I was fine.
[00:01:19] Abby Jorgensen: was just feeling a little, yeah.
[00:01:24] Gerard Donnelly: And your sub threshold felt hard, you said?
[00:01:27] Gerard Donnelly: Yeah, I don't know what was going on.
[00:01:31] Abby Jorgensen: It did not feel good at all.
[00:01:32] Abby Jorgensen: I don't know if my watts were off or if I just, my body was not wanting to do it.
[00:01:39] Gerard Donnelly: Are you feeling a bit tired, are you?
[00:01:41] Gerard Donnelly: Yeah, yesterday I felt a little bit fatigued as well.
[00:01:44] Abby Jorgensen: I mean, I ran.
[00:01:45] Abby Jorgensen: I just, my body didn't want to, but I did it.
[00:01:49] Gerard Donnelly: Yeah.
[00:01:51] Gerard Donnelly: What was your heart rate kind of in those efforts?
[00:01:55] Gerard Donnelly: In the 150s.
[00:01:57] Gerard Donnelly: What do you normally have when you're doing that?
[00:01:59] Gerard Donnelly: Is it...
[00:02:02] Gerard Donnelly: Was your heart rate high compared to?
[00:02:04] Abby Jorgensen: I felt like it was high compared to what it, even when I was like in the, even when I was in the like hundreds and whatever, it was still staying up into the 140s and 150s.
[00:02:15] Abby Jorgensen: I don't.
[00:02:18] Gerard Donnelly: Do you think the long endurance run the day before knocked you around a bit?
[00:02:22] Abby Jorgensen: Yeah, I mean, it was a little hotter.
[00:02:25] Abby Jorgensen: After I was done with that, I was pretty done for.
[00:02:28] Abby Jorgensen: Or I didn't even consider open water at that point.
[00:02:33] Abby Jorgensen: That's 34.
[00:02:34] Gerard Donnelly: That's what's that, 100 and something, isn't it?
[00:02:36] Gerard Donnelly: No, it was in the 80s, but then it's humid.
[00:02:42] Gerard Donnelly: That's hot.
[00:02:44] Gerard Donnelly: Yeah, I guess.
[00:02:45] Abby Jorgensen: I mean, comparatively, it wasn't as hot as last weekend.
[00:02:48] Gerard Donnelly: Yeah, well, 39, you know, it's 40 and 40.
[00:02:51] Gerard Donnelly: What's 40?
[00:02:52] Gerard Donnelly: Nearly 90 something, isn't it?
[00:02:53] Gerard Donnelly: 90s, yeah.
[00:02:54] Gerard Donnelly: Yeah.
[00:02:55] Gerard Donnelly: Yeah.
[00:02:57] Gerard Donnelly: It's a great training week.
[00:02:58] Gerard Donnelly: In terms of volume.
[00:03:00] Gerard Donnelly: Yeah, you've got, you know, really good, you know, two long runs.
[00:03:10] Gerard Donnelly: It's fantastic.
[00:03:12] Gerard Donnelly: And then you're going get a long run tomorrow, obviously.
[00:03:14] Gerard Donnelly: But, but yeah, yeah, it's going to be another 50, 60 K week of running.
[00:03:20] Gerard Donnelly: So you feeling okay with your running?
[00:03:24] Gerard Donnelly: Yeah, my running feels fine.
[00:03:25] Abby Jorgensen: Occasionally, like my, my hip, my hip and my left hip and knee start to bother me.
[00:03:30] Abby Jorgensen: But I think it's just as I need to do more mobility and stuff.
[00:03:34] Gerard Donnelly: But yeah, are you feeling a little bit more recovered from today's easy ride?
[00:03:41] Abby Jorgensen: Yeah, I mean, I'm a little tired.
[00:03:43] Abby Jorgensen: Like I could have took a nap today at some point.
[00:03:46] Abby Jorgensen: I was trying to get stuff done because then tomorrow I don't have a whole lot of time to get anything done.
[00:03:55] Gerard Donnelly: The heart rate's pretty good at just around 100.
[00:03:58] Gerard Donnelly: Yeah, today it was fine.
[00:04:00] Abby Jorgensen: Like, I've been waking up and my HRV and resting heart rates are fine.
[00:04:04] Gerard Donnelly: Good.
[00:04:04] Gerard Donnelly: Very good.
[00:04:05] Gerard Donnelly: Yeah.
[00:04:06] Abby Jorgensen: All right.
[00:04:07] Abby Jorgensen: Well, you're all set for tomorrow?
[00:04:09] Abby Jorgensen: Yeah.
[00:04:10] Abby Jorgensen: I mean...
[00:04:10] Abby Jorgensen: Temperature all right?
[00:04:12] Gerard Donnelly: Yeah, it's going to be even cooler tomorrow.
[00:04:15] Abby Jorgensen: Fantastic.
[00:04:16] Gerard Donnelly: So nutrition's key tomorrow.
[00:04:19] Gerard Donnelly: And really dial that in and have more than you need available.
[00:04:25] Gerard Donnelly: And if you don't use it, that's fine.
[00:04:27] Gerard Donnelly: But if you don't have enough and you need more, you're going to be caught out of it.
[00:04:32] Gerard Donnelly: And it's a massive day.
[00:04:33] Gerard Donnelly: So, you it's not often we do, you know, two and a half hour run after 160K, whatever it is, what is it, 90-something miles.
[00:04:42] Gerard Donnelly: 100.
[00:04:44] Gerard Donnelly: 99.9.
[00:04:45] Gerard Donnelly: You might as well push it to make it 100.
[00:04:48] Gerard Donnelly: So, yeah.
[00:04:49] Gerard Donnelly: And the goal is not to, you know, do anything but get pressure on the pedals.
[00:04:55] Gerard Donnelly: So, that's a goal.
[00:04:57] Gerard Donnelly: A in your ranges.
[00:04:59] Gerard Donnelly: And start...
[00:05:01] Gerard Donnelly: So, you know, just practice that.
[00:05:03] Gerard Donnelly: I've got a long day ahead of me.
[00:05:05] Gerard Donnelly: I just need to take it, take it conservatively.
[00:05:08] Gerard Donnelly: And, and patience and discipline is something we're trying to practice here so that when you get to the Ironman, you're good at it.
[00:05:15] Gerard Donnelly: You're good at staying patient and disciplined.
[00:05:20] Gerard Donnelly: Yeah.
[00:05:21] Gerard Donnelly: So pressure on the pedals, try to have as few brakes as you can so that you're consuming while you're moving.
[00:05:27] Gerard Donnelly: The more brakes you have, that's not true to what the race is.
[00:05:31] Gerard Donnelly: don't, you don't have brakes in the race.
[00:05:33] Gerard Donnelly: So, you know, keep it to a minimum in the race.
[00:05:36] Gerard Donnelly: You've got an opportunity to have a special needs bag.
[00:05:38] Gerard Donnelly: So that's one definite break that might be, you know, three or four minutes.
[00:05:43] Gerard Donnelly: But try the rest of the time to, to, you know, have 10 second break, 20 second break, you know, where you can just grab a, grab a new bottle if you have to.
[00:05:52] Gerard Donnelly: I'm not sure how you've got that set up, but.
[00:05:57] Abby Jorgensen: I have it.
[00:05:57] Abby Jorgensen: Well, my plan is, it's about.
[00:06:00] Abby Jorgensen: Out and back is 64 miles.
[00:06:04] Abby Jorgensen: And then I'll do another out and back of 40-ish miles or whatever it is.
[00:06:10] Abby Jorgensen: But yeah, I'll go back to my car.
[00:06:12] Abby Jorgensen: But I should have enough on my bike for the first 60 miles.
[00:06:17] Abby Jorgensen: So go back to the car like it's special needs after 60 miles.
[00:06:21] Gerard Donnelly: That's perfect.
[00:06:22] Gerard Donnelly: And spend three or four minutes.
[00:06:24] Gerard Donnelly: That's okay.
[00:06:25] Gerard Donnelly: Whatever.
[00:06:25] Gerard Donnelly: As quick, efficiently as you can.
[00:06:27] Gerard Donnelly: Yeah.
[00:06:28] Gerard Donnelly: Grab all the stuff you need and have all that ready as you already do.
[00:06:34] Gerard Donnelly: Be organized so that when you get back to the car after you finish the ride, you can, you know, again, act like transition and, you know, get something into you if you feel like it while you're getting your shoes on.
[00:06:48] Gerard Donnelly: But yeah, and keep going backwards and forwards with the run.
[00:06:54] Abby Jorgensen: Yeah, I usually drive to a spot that's a, it's a loop.
[00:06:58] Abby Jorgensen: So my car's always on the
[00:07:00] Abby Jorgensen: Every three miles, my car is.
[00:07:03] Gerard Donnelly: Yeah, and you can leave the bottle out, and you can't lock that, locked up, or whatever.
[00:07:10] Gerard Donnelly: People are going to steal your drink bottle far out.
[00:07:16] Abby Jorgensen: My keys in my car are good.
[00:07:20] Gerard Donnelly: All right.
[00:07:21] Gerard Donnelly: Okay, so going into the two weeks, the last week's going to be, you know, total reduction in volume, and the second last week, we're going to just do some shorter stuff, but it's going to be a big recovery, Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, where we're just doing virtually, you know, some swimming, some easy riding, and some running.
[00:07:43] Gerard Donnelly: After this day, we need to recover, okay?
[00:07:46] Gerard Donnelly: Yep.
[00:07:47] Gerard Donnelly: And then Thursday and the weekend will be just you doing a 60-minute and an easy run, okay?
[00:07:54] Gerard Donnelly: Short, short, short, faster, easy run, but all right?
[00:07:59] Gerard Donnelly: Yep, sounds good.
[00:08:00] Gerard Donnelly: Let's jump into your athletes.
[00:08:06] Gerard Donnelly: We might as start with Peter.
[00:08:12] Gerard Donnelly: Did that summary help?
[00:08:16] Abby Jorgensen: Yeah, your voice message helped last night.
[00:08:20] Gerard Donnelly: I'm glad you weren't on it because it would have been super frustrating.
[00:08:25] Gerard Donnelly: He can be frustrating because he has an ego.
[00:08:29] Abby Jorgensen: Oh, it's misty.
[00:08:30] Gerard Donnelly: Yeah, he actually admitted it.
[00:08:34] Gerard Donnelly: So I was able to challenge him back on everything, Abby.
[00:08:40] Gerard Donnelly: And when he said to me, flippantly, he said, my indoor and outdoor numbers are the same.
[00:08:45] Gerard Donnelly: So it can't be that.
[00:08:47] Gerard Donnelly: I said, they're not the same.
[00:08:49] Gerard Donnelly: There's 12 watts difference between what you tested in June.
[00:08:53] Gerard Donnelly: It's 306 compared to 294.
[00:08:56] Gerard Donnelly: You know, and he was like.
[00:09:00] Gerard Donnelly: I say anything.
[00:09:02] Gerard Donnelly: I said a lot of your issues are stemming from the fact that you just, you know, I went through his last three Thursdays, I said, what happened yesterday?
[00:09:13] Gerard Donnelly: You know, because it was red.
[00:09:15] Gerard Donnelly: He said, oh, I rode the gravel bike.
[00:09:17] Gerard Donnelly: I said, why are you doing that?
[00:09:19] Gerard Donnelly: You know, why would you ride the gravel bike?
[00:09:21] Gerard Donnelly: I said, last week, he rode erg mode, you know, and the week before, he missed.
[00:09:30] Gerard Donnelly: You know, so the last three Thursdays, you're not compliant with the program at all.
[00:09:35] Gerard Donnelly: So it's a bit hard to hear you calling our program out when you're not actually doing it.
[00:09:42] Gerard Donnelly: You know, so I said, you need to test yourself outdoor on an FTP test where you don't have the wahoo kicker potentially overriding the session, you know, because I don't think.
[00:10:00] Gerard Donnelly: I your attention to detail, Peter, is where it should be, and it would have been hard for him to hear all that, but he needs to.
[00:10:09] Gerard Donnelly: He can't send an email to us like that with outlandish sentences that are not true, and so he needs to be called out on it.
[00:10:19] Gerard Donnelly: That's not your job.
[00:10:23] Gerard Donnelly: That's right.
[00:10:24] Abby Jorgensen: I'm too nice, I think, sometimes.
[00:10:28] Gerard Donnelly: Yeah, and it causes issues like this, you know, and I'm saying to him, you say in your email that there's no progression.
[00:10:38] Gerard Donnelly: We can't have progression when you miss sessions.
[00:10:41] Gerard Donnelly: You know, what do you want us to do?
[00:10:43] Gerard Donnelly: Just skip the fact that you can't do two sets.
[00:10:45] Gerard Donnelly: We'll give you two and a half sets the next week.
[00:10:47] Gerard Donnelly: You know, that's what's good about having a coach, you know.
[00:10:52] Gerard Donnelly: If you miss a session, that's how attention to detail we are.
[00:10:56] Gerard Donnelly: We don't let you progress until you've actually done that session.
[00:10:59] Gerard Donnelly: you.
[00:11:01] Gerard Donnelly: And he wanted to change the subject all the time.
[00:11:05] Gerard Donnelly: He didn't want to be called out on anything.
[00:11:10] Gerard Donnelly: And so I said, look, Peter, you're a really, really good athlete.
[00:11:15] Gerard Donnelly: You know, you're getting caught up in power numbers.
[00:11:20] Gerard Donnelly: And then you tell me you don't race with power.
[00:11:23] Gerard Donnelly: You know, you're so, so obsessed with having a power at 300 and whatever you want.
[00:11:28] Gerard Donnelly: You're obsessed with that number.
[00:11:30] Gerard Donnelly: And then on race day, you don't even look at it.
[00:11:32] Gerard Donnelly: You go by feel.
[00:11:34] Gerard Donnelly: That is just, that's just a silly way to ride.
[00:11:38] Gerard Donnelly: You know, you need to use feel, power, heart rate, cadence, speed.
[00:11:44] Gerard Donnelly: You need to have all those metrics so you can make good decisions.
[00:11:47] Gerard Donnelly: And so it's a good lesson.
[00:11:49] Gerard Donnelly: You know, if someone's pushing back on you, you know, you need to say to them, it'll help you make better decisions and allow you to ride faster.
[00:11:57] Gerard Donnelly: You if you have more information.
[00:12:01] Gerard Donnelly: And I said to him, you know, what are you really looking at?
[00:12:07] Gerard Donnelly: He goes, oh, I'll just look at the speed because I know that I should be riding 25 miles an hour.
[00:12:11] Gerard Donnelly: I said, well, what happens when you're in a headwind and you're doing 19 miles an hour?
[00:12:14] Gerard Donnelly: What effort do you do there?
[00:12:16] Gerard Donnelly: You try and ride at 25 in a headwind.
[00:12:19] Gerard Donnelly: I what happens if you're in a tailwind?
[00:12:22] Gerard Donnelly: You're to stop from riding 35 miles an hour because you're in a tailwind?
[00:12:27] Gerard Donnelly: I'm only supposed to be doing 25?
[00:12:29] Gerard Donnelly: You know, that doesn't even make sense, Peter.
[00:12:32] Gerard Donnelly: You know, speed will dictate what power to ride.
[00:12:35] Gerard Donnelly: That's what the speed's for.
[00:12:38] Gerard Donnelly: If you look down and you're doing 20 miles an hour, that's your ticket to say, okay, I can ride at the top of the range.
[00:12:48] Gerard Donnelly: Do you understand that, Peter?
[00:12:50] Gerard Donnelly: He goes, oh, yeah, I thought that's what I should be doing.
[00:12:54] Gerard Donnelly: But I said, but that's what the power's for.
[00:12:56] Gerard Donnelly: You know, the power's not telling us what to ride.
[00:13:00] Gerard Donnelly: telling the
[00:13:00] Gerard Donnelly: At any given point, the speed is, whatever your speed is, is telling you what power to ride.
[00:13:04] Gerard Donnelly: You're getting it around the wrong way.
[00:13:06] Gerard Donnelly: I said, if I was doing a test and I rode 100 watts and it gave me 40 miles an hour, would I be unhappy that it was only 100 watts?
[00:13:18] Gerard Donnelly: Hell no.
[00:13:20] Gerard Donnelly: I'll take 40 miles an hour if it's 2 watts.
[00:13:23] Gerard Donnelly: You know, get that through your head.
[00:13:25] Gerard Donnelly: The speed is the important thing.
[00:13:27] Gerard Donnelly: Don't be fixated on, I'm a 307 watt rider.
[00:13:32] Gerard Donnelly: Well, if you ride 307 and you're doing 20 miles an hour, are you still happy?
[00:13:36] Gerard Donnelly: He said, no.
[00:13:38] Gerard Donnelly: I said, so work out what power equals the speed you want to ride at.
[00:13:44] Gerard Donnelly: And that's how you should be thinking.
[00:13:47] Gerard Donnelly: And I said to him, you know, for your Saturday session, you've got four 20-minute efforts.
[00:13:52] Gerard Donnelly: You know, if you do out and back on those efforts and go to a venue that you can do this on, because he says he lives in an area.
[00:14:01] Gerard Donnelly: I said, I drive an hour to my Saturday session, so I can do the session properly.
[00:14:08] Gerard Donnelly: And if you're not willing to do that, you know, you can't call us out on things that aren't true when you're not even willing to get up early and drive to a venue and do the session properly.
[00:14:20] Gerard Donnelly: So I think it was over an hour, Abby, of I'm letting him vent and then I'm pushing back on him.
[00:14:31] Gerard Donnelly: So, yeah, you know, he's agreeing to, you know, A, he's got a discounted price because I don't want you to lose an athlete.
[00:14:44] Gerard Donnelly: But B, I'm calling him out saying, if you're not going to do the program, then, you know, we don't want you on the program.
[00:14:50] Gerard Donnelly: It doesn't matter how good you are, Peter.
[00:14:53] Gerard Donnelly: And he said, you know, the sessions are too hard.
[00:14:56] Gerard Donnelly: And I said, they're too hard because you've got the wrong power number.
[00:14:59] Gerard Donnelly: Yes.
[00:14:59] Gerard Donnelly: You know?
[00:15:00] Gerard Donnelly: And you're using the wrong number.
[00:15:03] Gerard Donnelly: You know, when's the last time you went into your training peak settings or Zwift settings and adjusted them?
[00:15:08] Gerard Donnelly: You know, they should be the same all the time.
[00:15:12] Gerard Donnelly: I said, that's just not right.
[00:15:13] Gerard Donnelly: That's why we have testing periods and we have training periods.
[00:15:16] Gerard Donnelly: So they should be moving and you're in charge of moving them.
[00:15:19] Gerard Donnelly: So you're not, again, it's attention to detail.
[00:15:22] Gerard Donnelly: Because he said to me, I love the podcast and I love hearing all the things that you and Jordan talk about, but I don't feel that that's the program I'm getting.
[00:15:30] Gerard Donnelly: And, you know, that's like a dagger to my heart.
[00:15:33] Gerard Donnelly: It's like, don't say that stuff.
[00:15:35] Gerard Donnelly: You know, you're getting that program, but you're not doing that program.
[00:15:40] Gerard Donnelly: You're doing a version of it.
[00:15:42] Gerard Donnelly: And I said to him, he said, the sessions are too hard.
[00:15:45] Gerard Donnelly: I said, we have beginners who have never ridden a bike who can do the VO2 sessions and the threshold sessions.
[00:15:53] Gerard Donnelly: Why?
[00:15:54] Gerard Donnelly: Because they're training to the accurate number that they tested to.
[00:15:57] Gerard Donnelly: You test, but don't adjust any.
[00:16:00] Gerard Donnelly: Here's a data, and you try to train it, your old road bike power meter number, or your kicker number, which I've just told you, reads high.
[00:16:09] Gerard Donnelly: You know, it reads 12 watts higher over 20 minutes.
[00:16:13] Gerard Donnelly: It was really hard for him.
[00:16:15] Gerard Donnelly: He doesn't want to listen for that.
[00:16:19] Gerard Donnelly: Yeah, I can tell when I'm, first of all, he couldn't get his Google Meet to work.
[00:16:28] Gerard Donnelly: So I'm saying to him, you know, work it out.
[00:16:31] Gerard Donnelly: It's easy.
[00:16:31] Gerard Donnelly: Just open it up, take your headphones off, and just speak to the computer.
[00:16:36] Gerard Donnelly: You know, I'm not using any headphones here.
[00:16:38] Gerard Donnelly: Just the computer has a, you know, it can pick up your voice.
[00:16:46] Gerard Donnelly: So we had to do it by phone, you know, which is really frustrating for me because I wanted you to be able to watch the video.
[00:16:54] Gerard Donnelly: And then what did that make?
[00:16:55] Gerard Donnelly: It made me do another 12 minutes summary, you know.
[00:16:59] Gerard Donnelly: So not only do I spend an hour.
[00:17:00] Gerard Donnelly: There must have been another 12 minutes summarizing it, whereas Fathom would have done it for us.
[00:17:05] Gerard Donnelly: So anyway, so are you okay with all that?
[00:17:10] Abby Jorgensen: Yeah, and I mean, yeah, he's been racing like every, I feel like, all the time too.
[00:17:15] Abby Jorgensen: So I'm like, when he's always like, and I asked him every week, I'm like, do you want to taper for this race?
[00:17:23] Abby Jorgensen: Because is it important to you?
[00:17:25] Abby Jorgensen: And he's always like, yes, this race is important to me.
[00:17:28] Abby Jorgensen: So I'll like, do a mini taper, and then a recovery, and then he said that he's not getting the right program.
[00:17:36] Gerard Donnelly: Well, I spent 15 minutes saying, okay, if you're in winter, we would do three weeks, there's no race, we'd do three weeks, one week recovery, three weeks, one week recovery.
[00:17:47] Gerard Donnelly: We do that for about 12 weeks, there's no races, and you would have the progression that you're actually saying in the email.
[00:17:53] Gerard Donnelly: But when you do five races from May to August, that's like a race every two and a half weeks.
[00:18:02] Gerard Donnelly: So Abby's tapering you into the race and recovering you out of the race.
[00:18:07] Gerard Donnelly: So that's why it looks like you've got the same sessions because A, you miss the sessions and then we have to give it to you again and you're not getting, so he, you know, I've called him on that as well.
[00:18:18] Gerard Donnelly: Um, so I'm interested to see what he did yesterday.
[00:18:23] Abby Jorgensen: what are you doing here?
[00:18:30] Gerard Donnelly: Pushing lap so many times here.
[00:18:32] Gerard Donnelly: What's going on?
[00:18:33] Gerard Donnelly: That's easy.
[00:18:33] Gerard Donnelly: Okay.
[00:18:34] Gerard Donnelly: I got it.
[00:18:34] Gerard Donnelly: I'm with him.
[00:18:39] Gerard Donnelly: So, so that's his first effort, is it?
[00:18:41] Gerard Donnelly: Is that what we're doing?
[00:18:42] Gerard Donnelly: Yeah, it looks like it.
[00:18:44] Gerard Donnelly: Great.
[00:18:45] Gerard Donnelly: So here we go.
[00:18:46] Gerard Donnelly: 37.7 and he's done.
[00:18:52] Gerard Donnelly: So I said to him, you must start and finish at the same spot.
[00:18:57] Gerard Donnelly: He's kind of done that on the first one.
[00:18:59] Gerard Donnelly: What's this big gap for?
[00:19:00] Gerard Donnelly: going.
[00:19:00] Gerard Donnelly: where are
[00:19:00] Gerard Donnelly: What are these gaps?
[00:19:03] Gerard Donnelly: God.
[00:19:11] Gerard Donnelly: All right.
[00:19:14] Gerard Donnelly: 232, 36.
[00:19:21] Gerard Donnelly: 244, 36.
[00:19:28] Gerard Donnelly: 239, 36.
[00:19:29] Gerard Donnelly: So he's done the session, but this is ridiculous.
[00:19:37] Gerard Donnelly: Did you have a look?
[00:19:39] Gerard Donnelly: I think he just completed it, or I haven't looked at it today.
[00:19:43] Gerard Donnelly: So he's had 40 minutes, Abby, of – so he did that section, the 420 minutes.
[00:19:51] Gerard Donnelly: He did it in an hour and a half, and his total running time was two hours six.
[00:19:57] Gerard Donnelly: So 33 minutes rest.
[00:20:00] Gerard Donnelly: right
[00:20:02] Gerard Donnelly: So that would be a text message I'd be saying to him, hey Peter, great effort to drive to wherever he drove to, because I don't think, I think he's, you'd be able to tell me.
[00:20:16] Abby Jorgensen: Oh yeah, that looks like, doesn't look like his normal spot.
[00:20:22] Gerard Donnelly: Where's he live?
[00:20:23] Gerard Donnelly: Over here, somewhere?
[00:20:24] Gerard Donnelly: Yeah, I believe.
[00:20:33] Abby Jorgensen: Yeah, that doesn't look like his normal spot.
[00:20:35] Abby Jorgensen: Yeah.
[00:20:40] Abby Jorgensen: So that's good, even though it's got a bit of a rise.
[00:20:45] Abby Jorgensen: How much gradient is there?
[00:20:49] Gerard Donnelly: It's not that bad, it's only 1.7.
[00:20:52] Gerard Donnelly: Yeah.
[00:20:53] Gerard Donnelly: Anyway, he's, he's trying to do out in back, so that's one.
[00:20:59] Gerard Donnelly: Yeah.
[00:21:00] Gerard Donnelly: Yeah.
[00:21:09] Gerard Donnelly: So that's the tailwind downhill, 49 k's an hour, and then headwind, 29 k's an hour, 230, so look, he's doing the session correctly, out and back, that's well done, but I would say to him, and I would get this, Abby, I'd do this, I'd grab it, write down in my notes, this is what I would do, 231, and whatever the speed is, that 36 k's an hour, what's that, 22 miles an hour, is it, 23?
[00:21:43] Gerard Donnelly: Yeah, probably around there.
[00:21:45] Gerard Donnelly: So I'll be saying, okay, 231, 23 miles an hour, next one, whatever it is, 237, 22 miles an hour, 23 miles an hour, and the last one...
[00:21:59] Gerard Donnelly: We didn't...
[00:22:01] Gerard Donnelly: So that's the problem, you don't do out and back, oh he's just done longer, so he has done, I've grabbed the wrong bit, sorry, he has done out and back, take that back, 2.39 at 3.36, so I would have those four sessions and give them that information, and say, really good, the problem, or not the problem, just let me know why you stopped the, because you can see his heart rate stopped as well, see that, that's him stopping the watch, you know, and the actual Garmin stops it for, you know, why is he having a 15 minute stop?
[00:23:00] Gerard Donnelly: Thank you.
[00:24:03] Gerard Donnelly: You've got three stops in a 30-minute run.
[00:24:09] Gerard Donnelly: I don't know if he realises that we can see that he stopped literally for three minutes over 6K.
[00:24:18] Gerard Donnelly: Every time you stop, look at his heart rate.
[00:24:20] Gerard Donnelly: It was at 144.
[00:24:23] Gerard Donnelly: After he resumes, it's 123.
[00:24:26] Gerard Donnelly: That's the coaching bit.
[00:24:28] Gerard Donnelly: That's what you're telling him.
[00:24:31] Gerard Donnelly: When it comes to race day, just like I said to you before, make the stop minimum on the bike so that we keep your heart rate and fatigue as a continuous thing because that's what's going to happen on race day.
[00:24:43] Gerard Donnelly: It's just going to be one continuous fatigue.
[00:24:48] Gerard Donnelly: This is not meant to be an interval session.
[00:24:50] Gerard Donnelly: This is meant to be a continuous run so that when it comes to race day, every time you stop, people pass you and your time slows down.
[00:25:00] Gerard Donnelly: So, he's got the easy run.
[00:25:04] Gerard Donnelly: He's got two weeks before there.
[00:25:06] Gerard Donnelly: Are you okay with the next two weeks with him?
[00:25:08] Gerard Donnelly: Yeah, I should be.
[00:25:11] Gerard Donnelly: So, he hasn't really done any long.
[00:25:13] Abby Jorgensen: So, this next week I should do an indoor FTP and an outdoor.
[00:25:17] Abby Jorgensen: Is that what you sent the voice message yesterday, last night?
[00:25:20] Gerard Donnelly: Yeah, yeah.
[00:25:21] Gerard Donnelly: So, I'll be doing the 60-minute outdoor here, or Saturday or Sunday, the 60-minuter.
[00:25:29] Abby Jorgensen: Okay.
[00:25:31] Gerard Donnelly: And for training purposes, we're not going to do many more indoor FTP.
[00:25:37] Gerard Donnelly: We're not going to train indoor until after the race.
[00:25:39] Gerard Donnelly: So, the indoor is not as important.
[00:25:42] Gerard Donnelly: But the reason I would do it is so that he can test on his TT bike indoor in the TT position, okay?
[00:25:55] Gerard Donnelly: And get him to run off the bike on that 60-minute.
[00:25:58] Gerard Donnelly: So, do 60-minute and then 5K.
[00:26:00] Gerard Donnelly: Okay, run off the bike.
[00:26:03] Gerard Donnelly: Okay?
[00:26:04] Gerard Donnelly: Okay.
[00:26:05] Gerard Donnelly: And so Monday, Monday, Tuesday, I would be just doing, you know, a normal swim.
[00:26:13] Gerard Donnelly: Tuesday, you would do some zone two riding.
[00:26:16] Gerard Donnelly: And then Wednesday, maybe, what's he been doing in his running?
[00:26:21] Gerard Donnelly: Have been doing the tempo efforts?
[00:26:24] Abby Jorgensen: He wanted to, like, we've been doing a longer, like a mid-rest run, I guess.
[00:26:30] Gerard Donnelly: Yeah.
[00:26:31] Abby Jorgensen: So we did do some tempos earlier.
[00:26:35] Abby Jorgensen: Yeah.
[00:26:35] Gerard Donnelly: So get him to run the Wednesday a little bit shorter, but get him to do some half Ironman paced efforts.
[00:26:46] Gerard Donnelly: So whatever you think he's going to run for his half Ironman pace, get him to do three by eight efforts at his half Ironman pace.
[00:26:55] Gerard Donnelly: Okay?
[00:26:57] Gerard Donnelly: Okay.
[00:26:57] Gerard Donnelly: On the Wednesday.
[00:26:58] Gerard Donnelly: Thursday, FTP.
[00:26:59] Gerard Donnelly: Okay.
[00:26:59] Gerard Donnelly: Okay.
[00:27:00] Gerard Donnelly: So Friday, swim and easy run.
[00:27:07] Abby Jorgensen: Friday, swim and easy run.
[00:27:10] Gerard Donnelly: And Saturday is a 60-minute with a 5K off the bike.
[00:27:15] Gerard Donnelly: And then Sunday is just, you know, if he swims or a recovery ride.
[00:27:20] Gerard Donnelly: And then the normal taper into race week.
[00:27:24] Gerard Donnelly: Okay.
[00:27:25] Gerard Donnelly: Okay?
[00:27:26] Abby Jorgensen: Yep.
[00:27:28] Abby Jorgensen: All right.
[00:27:29] Gerard Donnelly: We'll just, we'll get into the rest of them.
[00:27:32] Gerard Donnelly: Coco?
[00:27:33] Gerard Donnelly: Oh, any more questions on Peter?
[00:27:35] Gerard Donnelly: Sorry.
[00:27:36] Gerard Donnelly: No, you're good.
[00:27:37] Gerard Donnelly: Yep.
[00:27:39] Gerard Donnelly: Don't let me go forward.
[00:27:40] Gerard Donnelly: if you've got questions, stop me.
[00:27:42] Gerard Donnelly: Okay?
[00:27:42] Gerard Donnelly: Yep.
[00:27:43] Gerard Donnelly: How's Coco going?
[00:27:45] Gerard Donnelly: What's happening?
[00:27:46] Gerard Donnelly: She's got the Swiss championships.
[00:27:47] Gerard Donnelly: What's that?
[00:27:48] Gerard Donnelly: That's Olympic distance.
[00:27:50] Gerard Donnelly: Olympic, great.
[00:27:51] Gerard Donnelly: Yep.
[00:27:52] Gerard Donnelly: And then she's the half Ironman.
[00:27:55] Gerard Donnelly: That's her key, is it?
[00:27:56] Gerard Donnelly: And then...
[00:27:58] Gerard Donnelly: And then Marabello...
[00:28:00] Abby Jorgensen: Oh, the...
[00:28:00] Abby Jorgensen: Championships, yeah.
[00:28:01] Gerard Donnelly: Okay.
[00:28:02] Gerard Donnelly: Good.
[00:28:04] Gerard Donnelly: And she's happy?
[00:28:05] Gerard Donnelly: Yeah, she had a good session today.
[00:28:16] Gerard Donnelly: She can write, can't she?
[00:28:18] Gerard Donnelly: Yeah.
[00:28:20] Abby Jorgensen: She said today was like the first time.
[00:28:22] Abby Jorgensen: was kind of uninterrupted, too, with traffic.
[00:28:28] Gerard Donnelly: So what was she meant to do?
[00:28:29] Gerard Donnelly: 60K with it?
[00:28:33] Gerard Donnelly: Yeah.
[00:28:34] Gerard Donnelly: So she did 180, 179, 35Ks an hour.
[00:28:41] Gerard Donnelly: What a pity.
[00:28:43] Gerard Donnelly: If you can, when some of the athletes do the 60 or 75 or 90, tell them to stop and save their warm-up and then start a new session because I want to look at the distribution.
[00:28:57] Gerard Donnelly: And that's in a warm-up, you know.
[00:28:59] Gerard Donnelly: Mm-hmm.
[00:29:00] Gerard Donnelly: This is good.
[00:29:00] Gerard Donnelly: Because she's got literally 10 minutes above 2.15.
[00:29:05] Gerard Donnelly: You know, some of that could have been in the warm-up.
[00:29:09] Gerard Donnelly: But I'm happy if she's pushing good numbers at the end there.
[00:29:14] Abby Jorgensen: Yeah, she looked like she got stronger at the – she said she thought she was going to be too conservative this morning.
[00:29:20] Abby Jorgensen: I was like, you – every effort got better.
[00:29:25] Abby Jorgensen: Yeah.
[00:29:26] Abby Jorgensen: So I don't – I was like, it's – that's normally what you ride at, the 180 to – range, so.
[00:29:36] Gerard Donnelly: Yeah, so if she can – if she can push – if she can push up to 2.14, let her, you know.
[00:29:44] Gerard Donnelly: And tell her when – in for the future, you know, start the way – she's doing it really well, Abby.
[00:29:51] Gerard Donnelly: She's starting very – what's she doing here?
[00:29:54] Gerard Donnelly: She's going out and back, is she?
[00:29:57] Gerard Donnelly: Yeah.
[00:29:58] Gerard Donnelly: So that's an out and back.
[00:30:00] Gerard Donnelly: wrote down.
[00:30:00] Gerard Donnelly: Thank
[00:30:00] Gerard Donnelly: So, 174 at 35, so which direction's the wind going?
[00:30:12] Gerard Donnelly: So 176, so she's got a tailwind out, and a headwind back, and she's got the power wrong.
[00:30:23] Gerard Donnelly: So, in the tailwind, she's 176.
[00:30:26] Gerard Donnelly: In the headwind, she's 173.
[00:30:30] Gerard Donnelly: That was the first effort.
[00:30:32] Gerard Donnelly: Let's see what she does in the second effort.
[00:30:46] Abby Jorgensen: So, 32 at 181.
[00:30:52] Gerard Donnelly: It's good.
[00:30:52] Gerard Donnelly: She got it right the second out and back.
[00:30:54] Gerard Donnelly: So, just keep telling her, look, when the bite's going slower, Coco, more power.
[00:31:00] Gerard Donnelly: Just keep that message going, okay?
[00:31:03] Gerard Donnelly: Yeah, she's sort of ending up at the same spot as she's finishing, but it's okay.
[00:31:20] Gerard Donnelly: There's not a lot of criticism here.
[00:31:22] Gerard Donnelly: It's really good pressure on the pedals, and I think she's progressively got faster, which is exactly what we want.
[00:31:28] Gerard Donnelly: So I'm super happy with that.
[00:31:32] Gerard Donnelly: Is she running okay?
[00:31:33] Gerard Donnelly: Yep.
[00:31:34] Abby Jorgensen: I feel like no matter what, she's off the pike and runs fine.
[00:31:39] Gerard Donnelly: Fantastic.
[00:31:41] Gerard Donnelly: 348.
[00:31:41] Gerard Donnelly: So if you're thinking, you know, if we've set that too easy and she's able to run 348, then all the time you keep looking at what she's doing this week and then adjust it down.
[00:31:53] Gerard Donnelly: And obviously, if you're giving them more Ks, then that's not true.
[00:31:58] Gerard Donnelly: But don't try and push it too much.
[00:32:01] Gerard Donnelly: Tell her that, yeah, that's great to be running that well off the bike, but we don't want to push it too much, especially, so she's saying her legs feel empty.
[00:32:12] Gerard Donnelly: She's struggling with those efforts.
[00:32:13] Gerard Donnelly: Yeah, she does, but then she hits everything.
[00:32:17] Gerard Donnelly: Yeah, she did.
[00:32:20] Gerard Donnelly: We've got all of her data right, indoor.
[00:32:27] Abby Jorgensen: Yeah, I've told her to check it several times.
[00:32:29] Abby Jorgensen: Yeah, she did this one outdoor.
[00:32:31] Abby Jorgensen: Didn't get to bed, actually.
[00:32:33] Gerard Donnelly: Yep.
[00:32:34] Gerard Donnelly: That's great.
[00:32:36] Gerard Donnelly: Look at that.
[00:32:37] Gerard Donnelly: That's fantastic.
[00:32:44] Gerard Donnelly: That must be uphill, is it?
[00:32:48] Abby Jorgensen: Yeah, I think so.
[00:32:51] Gerard Donnelly: The whole thing's uphill.
[00:32:55] Gerard Donnelly: I think they have a lot of hills there.
[00:32:57] Gerard Donnelly: Yes.
[00:32:59] Abby Jorgensen: From my understanding understanding understanding understanding understanding here.
[00:33:00] Abby Jorgensen: here.
[00:33:01] Abby Jorgensen: Shear her heads.
[00:33:03] Abby Jorgensen: Yep.
[00:33:05] Gerard Donnelly: Lucerne has a track around the lake, which I've ridden.
[00:33:09] Gerard Donnelly: So if she wants to get flat, she can do that.
[00:33:16] Gerard Donnelly: Sometimes we don't want them to get the...
[00:33:20] Gerard Donnelly: It's not ideal.
[00:33:23] Gerard Donnelly: We want to get them to generate their own power.
[00:33:25] Gerard Donnelly: And when you're on the flat, you have to do that yourself.
[00:33:27] Gerard Donnelly: When you're on a hill, all you're doing is pushing against the hill, which is helping you push more power.
[00:33:34] Gerard Donnelly: So just be careful on that one, all right?
[00:33:37] Gerard Donnelly: Yep.
[00:33:41] Gerard Donnelly: Yep.
[00:33:43] Gerard Donnelly: All right.
[00:33:44] Gerard Donnelly: That's really good.
[00:33:47] Gerard Donnelly: So do you think she's recovered enough?
[00:33:49] Gerard Donnelly: So you've got recovery week there.
[00:33:53] Gerard Donnelly: Should we have tested there in that recovery week or...?
[00:33:57] Gerard Donnelly: I feel like...
[00:34:00] Abby Jorgensen: So we've got...
[00:34:00] Gerard Donnelly: got...
[00:34:00] Gerard Donnelly: So we've
[00:34:01] Gerard Donnelly: Just know it's recovery.
[00:34:02] Abby Jorgensen: Well, yeah, well, I put recovery for Monday and Tuesday because she had just raced, so.
[00:34:07] Gerard Donnelly: Just raced, okay, yep.
[00:34:09] Gerard Donnelly: Yeah.
[00:34:09] Gerard Donnelly: And that's not really recovery week then, so it's just from the race.
[00:34:14] Gerard Donnelly: Where were we up to with her actual weeks?
[00:34:17] Gerard Donnelly: That was race week.
[00:34:19] Gerard Donnelly: So that was week one.
[00:34:20] Gerard Donnelly: Okay, new block, race week.
[00:34:22] Gerard Donnelly: It was the start of week two, and then that's week three.
[00:34:30] Gerard Donnelly: So you've resumed the second half, so this is week three then, isn't it, really?
[00:34:36] Gerard Donnelly: Yeah, guess that would be.
[00:34:37] Abby Jorgensen: Yep.
[00:34:39] Gerard Donnelly: We were four weeks from Italy, so I didn't know how to go into Italy.
[00:34:46] Gerard Donnelly: So she's done a half Ironman, half marathon.
[00:34:58] Gerard Donnelly: So she's done a So she's She's done half.
[00:35:00] Gerard Donnelly: Thank
[00:35:03] Gerard Donnelly: There's a bit of elevation in that, but there is a big gap between her normalised, 199, and her average.
[00:35:13] Gerard Donnelly: You said there's some really big hill.
[00:35:17] Gerard Donnelly: Yeah.
[00:35:19] Abby Jorgensen: And then it was raining really hard the first lap, and then followed the second lap.
[00:35:25] Gerard Donnelly: We did look at that, we?
[00:35:27] Gerard Donnelly: Yeah.
[00:35:28] Abby Jorgensen: That's great.
[00:35:29] Gerard Donnelly: Okay, so she's got that Olympic distance, so that's great.
[00:35:36] Abby Jorgensen: That's what I was thinking.
[00:35:37] Abby Jorgensen: We used that kind of as a test, too.
[00:35:40] Gerard Donnelly: Perfect.
[00:35:41] Abby Jorgensen: Because she said she doesn't want to taper into that or anything.
[00:35:45] Abby Jorgensen: Yeah.
[00:35:46] Gerard Donnelly: But give her an easy Friday, easy Saturday, okay?
[00:35:50] Gerard Donnelly: Yeah.
[00:35:51] Gerard Donnelly: And then that would be the normal 60-minute FTP.
[00:35:55] Gerard Donnelly: She's already going to do a 10K run off the bike here, so we don't don't need to test her.
[00:36:00] Gerard Donnelly: So
[00:36:01] Gerard Donnelly: On the run, just give her a 60 minute plus a 5k off the bike.
[00:36:06] Gerard Donnelly: Let her, you know, have an easy Monday, Tuesday, and then solid Thursday, and then you can do the normal taper.
[00:36:14] Gerard Donnelly: Okay?
[00:36:15] Gerard Donnelly: Okay.
[00:36:17] Abby Jorgensen: Anything else on her?
[00:36:19] Gerard Donnelly: Nope, we're good.
[00:36:21] Abby Jorgensen: Doogie?
[00:36:22] Abby Jorgensen: Doogie's on vacation and is a lot all over the place right now.
[00:36:26] Abby Jorgensen: So we're trying to get some consistency, but I think once school starts and they get back from holiday, he's like, I'm hoping to get back to, but then he has a ride in two weeks, maybe, three weeks?
[00:36:41] Gerard Donnelly: Yeah.
[00:36:43] Gerard Donnelly: Just really reach out to him and say, you know, you're in Greece, it's hot, you can go for a run, you know, there's nothing stopping you from running.
[00:36:54] Gerard Donnelly: So hopefully he takes you up on it.
[00:36:56] Gerard Donnelly: Yeah.
[00:36:57] Gerard Donnelly: Anything on him?
[00:36:59] Gerard Donnelly: No, we're good.
[00:37:00] Abby Jorgensen: Just trying to...
[00:37:01] Abby Jorgensen: I'm trying to get him to not travel as much.
[00:37:04] Gerard Donnelly: Yep.
[00:37:05] Gerard Donnelly: It is summer.
[00:37:07] Gerard Donnelly: How's Andrew doing?
[00:37:09] Gerard Donnelly: He's good.
[00:37:10] Gerard Donnelly: I just talked to him this morning.
[00:37:11] Abby Jorgensen: Yep.
[00:37:12] Gerard Donnelly: What are we going to call?
[00:37:13] Gerard Donnelly: Just to remind me.
[00:37:14] Abby Jorgensen: Ironman Florida, November.
[00:37:16] Abby Jorgensen: November.
[00:37:17] Abby Jorgensen: Yep, Ironman Florida, yep.
[00:37:18] Gerard Donnelly: Okay.
[00:37:22] Gerard Donnelly: So what did he just do?
[00:37:23] Gerard Donnelly: Has he done anything recently?
[00:37:25] Abby Jorgensen: Oh, he did Ironman Muncie, but we just tested this week.
[00:37:28] Abby Jorgensen: Yep.
[00:37:29] Abby Jorgensen: Okay.
[00:37:30] Abby Jorgensen: How'd he go?
[00:37:31] Abby Jorgensen: He, his FTP did an outdoor one, did really well, got better, and then his open water swim did good there, and then he'll do a run tomorrow.
[00:37:43] Abby Jorgensen: But yeah, he's improved on everything.
[00:37:46] Abby Jorgensen: He's feeling good, so.
[00:37:50] Gerard Donnelly: Sorry, I'm just looking up his history in the spreadsheet.
[00:37:58] Gerard Donnelly: So, it hasn't been recorded.
[00:38:00] Gerard Donnelly: recorded.
[00:38:01] Gerard Donnelly: Yeah, that's right.
[00:38:08] Gerard Donnelly: Okay, so what's he like outdoor?
[00:38:12] Gerard Donnelly: Oh, he did a 60-minute do you?
[00:38:13] Gerard Donnelly: Yep.
[00:38:15] Gerard Donnelly: Fantastic.
[00:38:16] Gerard Donnelly: Yeah, no, he did really well.
[00:38:17] Abby Jorgensen: He executed it almost perfectly.
[00:38:20] Abby Jorgensen: I know, it is recorded.
[00:38:21] Gerard Donnelly: Sorry.
[00:38:22] Gerard Donnelly: I'm looking at the 20 minutes.
[00:38:26] Gerard Donnelly: So he's gone a kilometre and bit faster than he did in July.
[00:38:31] Gerard Donnelly: That's great.
[00:38:32] Gerard Donnelly: He's gone up 10 watts, 11 watts.
[00:38:35] Gerard Donnelly: Really good.
[00:38:45] Gerard Donnelly: He's come home strong.
[00:38:53] Gerard Donnelly: Fantastic.
[00:38:53] Gerard Donnelly: Abby, I'd get him to do 30 minutes out and back.
[00:38:57] Gerard Donnelly: Okay.
[00:38:58] Gerard Donnelly: Sorry.
[00:38:59] Gerard Donnelly: All right.
[00:39:00] Gerard Donnelly: 15 minutes.
[00:39:00] Gerard Donnelly: 15 minutes.
[00:39:01] Gerard Donnelly: But just because it's just basically a headwind the whole way, and then it's a tailwind.
[00:39:10] Gerard Donnelly: I know it's two turns extra, but at least you get practice that I should be riding higher, I should be riding lower, I should be riding higher, I should be riding lower.
[00:39:19] Gerard Donnelly: But when you just go in 30 minutes, straight into a headwind, or 30 minutes in a tailwind, you're not getting the same practice about, yeah.
[00:39:34] Gerard Donnelly: So half marathon tomorrow?
[00:39:36] Gerard Donnelly: Yep.
[00:39:39] Gerard Donnelly: So he's done a 158 in his race in May.
[00:39:45] Gerard Donnelly: Is that right, 158?
[00:39:46] Gerard Donnelly: Yeah.
[00:39:49] Gerard Donnelly: And he's done a, what's his best 10k?
[00:39:52] Gerard Donnelly: 50 minutes in May?
[00:39:54] Gerard Donnelly: 49, 57, is that right?
[00:39:56] Gerard Donnelly: Has he done one since then?
[00:40:00] Abby Jorgensen: Not that I
[00:40:01] Abby Jorgensen: Not that I remember.
[00:40:05] Gerard Donnelly: 10K.
[00:40:10] Gerard Donnelly: Is that just a run?
[00:40:12] Gerard Donnelly: 526.
[00:40:16] Gerard Donnelly: 10K.
[00:40:17] Gerard Donnelly: 10K off the bike, or maybe?
[00:40:23] Abby Jorgensen: That's 11th of May.
[00:40:24] Gerard Donnelly: No, she's 10K TT.
[00:40:39] Abby Jorgensen: That's the same day.
[00:40:41] Gerard Donnelly: Okay.
[00:40:46] Gerard Donnelly: Yeah, okay.
[00:40:49] Gerard Donnelly: Half marathon.
[00:40:59] Gerard Donnelly: So, you know, his last one was a 150.
[00:41:01] Gerard Donnelly: 10K.
[00:41:01] Gerard Donnelly: 10K.
[00:41:01] Gerard Donnelly: 10K.
[00:41:01] Gerard Donnelly: Seven.
[00:41:02] Gerard Donnelly: Have we got that set too hard for him?
[00:41:06] Gerard Donnelly: Yeah.
[00:41:11] Gerard Donnelly: That's all I'm looking at.
[00:41:13] Abby Jorgensen: Yeah, I'm just trying to remember that half marathon.
[00:41:17] Abby Jorgensen: He didn't, like, push the pace or anything, he said.
[00:41:22] Gerard Donnelly: But if we go into his zone, what's his zone set at?
[00:41:27] Gerard Donnelly: Is it set from that 10K, is it?
[00:41:30] Gerard Donnelly: Yeah.
[00:41:31] Abby Jorgensen: Is it?
[00:41:32] Gerard Donnelly: It should be.
[00:41:38] Gerard Donnelly: 5.37, is that right?
[00:41:40] Gerard Donnelly: 5.37?
[00:41:49] Gerard Donnelly: Where do you run?
[00:41:51] Gerard Donnelly: Bang on five minutes.
[00:41:55] Abby Jorgensen: Eight-minute mile.
[00:41:57] Gerard Donnelly: Is it?
[00:41:58] Gerard Donnelly: The default's not right.
[00:42:00] Gerard Donnelly: No.
[00:42:01] Gerard Donnelly: No.
[00:42:01] Gerard Donnelly: Oh, run speed.
[00:42:02] Gerard Donnelly: It's right.
[00:42:03] Gerard Donnelly: It's bang on.
[00:42:04] Gerard Donnelly: So there's two.
[00:42:05] Gerard Donnelly: There's the default run, which is set at 537, and that gets overridden by the run speed.
[00:42:15] Gerard Donnelly: So the run speed's right.
[00:42:17] Gerard Donnelly: So it says he should be able to run a 150, if that's right.
[00:42:24] Gerard Donnelly: But if I put that into, what do you run?
[00:42:32] Gerard Donnelly: 49.57.
[00:42:35] Abby Jorgensen: Macmillan?
[00:42:36] Abby Jorgensen: Yeah.
[00:42:37] Abby Jorgensen: Where's my Macmillan at?
[00:42:41] Gerard Donnelly: I can plug it in.
[00:42:42] Gerard Donnelly: I've got it up.
[00:42:43] Gerard Donnelly: 49.57.
[00:42:48] Gerard Donnelly: Calculate.
[00:42:50] Gerard Donnelly: Okay.
[00:42:52] Gerard Donnelly: Yeah, you're right.
[00:42:53] Gerard Donnelly: 151.
[00:42:55] Gerard Donnelly: 151.20.
[00:42:58] Gerard Donnelly: Anyway, have you chatted to him about that pacing?
[00:43:00] Gerard Donnelly: 151.205.205
[00:43:02] Abby Jorgensen: He seemed confident this morning when I talked to him.
[00:43:04] Abby Jorgensen: Yes, okay.
[00:43:05] Abby Jorgensen: But I can message him again later tonight, too.
[00:43:08] Gerard Donnelly: Let's just say, Gerard and have had a chat.
[00:43:10] Gerard Donnelly: We don't want you to blow up on this, so be more conservative.
[00:43:13] Gerard Donnelly: If you end up running a 153 or a 154, we're okay with that, okay?
[00:43:18] Gerard Donnelly: Okay.
[00:43:19] Gerard Donnelly: Don't start out too hard.
[00:43:20] Gerard Donnelly: That's actually just the message is that's a guide.
[00:43:24] Gerard Donnelly: It's totally a guide, and whatever you feel you can do.
[00:43:29] Gerard Donnelly: This is a training practice session.
[00:43:30] Gerard Donnelly: So, okay?
[00:43:32] Gerard Donnelly: Okay.
[00:43:36] Gerard Donnelly: Rush ready phase.
[00:43:41] Abby Jorgensen: Yeah, he should be 10 weeks out next week.
[00:43:43] Abby Jorgensen: From the Ironman, yeah, okay.
[00:43:47] Gerard Donnelly: Good.
[00:43:49] Gerard Donnelly: Yeah, that looks great, Abby.
[00:43:51] Gerard Donnelly: What's his longest run?
[00:43:54] Gerard Donnelly: Like 220, I think.
[00:43:56] Gerard Donnelly: That's fantastic.
[00:43:57] Gerard Donnelly: Okay.
[00:43:58] Gerard Donnelly: Yeah, that's great.
[00:44:01] Gerard Donnelly: Switch.
[00:44:01] Gerard Donnelly: Switch.
[00:44:01] Gerard Donnelly: Switch.
[00:44:01] Gerard Donnelly: Switch.
[00:44:01] Gerard Donnelly: Yep, you got that right.
[00:44:03] Gerard Donnelly: Cindy, anything else on Andrew?
[00:44:06] Gerard Donnelly: Nope, Andrew's good.
[00:44:09] Abby Jorgensen: Cindy, she messaged me this morning.
[00:44:11] Abby Jorgensen: Her physical therapist thinks she's having some IT issues.
[00:44:15] Abby Jorgensen: So she ran today and she wanted to see if she could, she was having some mental battles with her knee.
[00:44:22] Abby Jorgensen: So she ran today and wanted to move to bike till tomorrow.
[00:44:28] Abby Jorgensen: So that's what we're doing and then we're going to kind of, we might take it a little bit more easy going into Santa Cruz just to keep her knee from flaring up.
[00:44:38] Gerard Donnelly: Yep, how's she going with the actual session?
[00:44:40] Gerard Donnelly: She's doing a lot.
[00:44:41] Gerard Donnelly: Yeah, she's doing good.
[00:44:44] Abby Jorgensen: Yeah.
[00:44:45] Gerard Donnelly: So cadence is still low.
[00:44:49] Gerard Donnelly: Oh no, no, it's not.
[00:44:50] Gerard Donnelly: Take that back.
[00:44:51] Gerard Donnelly: No, cadence is good.
[00:44:52] Gerard Donnelly: It's just the last one.
[00:44:54] Gerard Donnelly: And taking the strength if it's out, did that help?
[00:44:57] Gerard Donnelly: but she still, it looks like she still did low cadence on it, but she
[00:45:01] Abby Jorgensen: She said her knees felt fine after it.
[00:45:04] Abby Jorgensen: She must not have read the session, but, I mean, she hit the goal, but, yeah, she said her knees have felt better this week, but she is worried that they're going to flare up again because of the, she has this intensity that, you know, I don't know.
[00:45:24] Gerard Donnelly: Did you let her know that she got the cadence wrong?
[00:45:27] Gerard Donnelly: Yeah.
[00:45:28] Abby Jorgensen: Okay.
[00:45:36] Abby Jorgensen: So, I wanted to cut down a little bit of some stuff for her for this next week.
[00:45:53] Abby Jorgensen: Oh, I think I was going to ask you, yeah, what, to keep the intensity down for Thursday.
[00:45:59] Abby Jorgensen: Should we still do a 40-20 or should
[00:46:03] Gerard Donnelly: Are you thinking the intensity is causing her issues?
[00:46:07] Gerard Donnelly: That's what she said her physical therapist thinks.
[00:46:09] Abby Jorgensen: When she jumped into the program, she was self-coaching herself, and she didn't do this high intensity of stuff.
[00:46:19] Gerard Donnelly: I would be doing a sub-threshold there then.
[00:46:22] Gerard Donnelly: Okay.
[00:46:33] Abby Jorgensen: I mean, she's hit every one of them, but, yeah, I hate to override her physical therapist that she's trusted in and worked with, you know.
[00:46:44] Gerard Donnelly: Yeah, well, maybe we should be cutting out.
[00:46:48] Abby Jorgensen: I was wondering on that one, too, what to just do a sub-threshold there, too, or?
[00:46:53] Abby Jorgensen: Yeah, maybe.
[00:46:56] Gerard Donnelly: You know, we've got the tempo.
[00:47:00] Gerard Donnelly: Oh, yeah, there's only two.
[00:47:01] Gerard Donnelly: This one?
[00:47:04] Gerard Donnelly: The Tempo Norwegian?
[00:47:07] Gerard Donnelly: Okay.
[00:47:08] Gerard Donnelly: So I'd give her those.
[00:47:11] Gerard Donnelly: They're sort of, they're not as hard as those.
[00:47:14] Gerard Donnelly: Okay.
[00:47:15] Gerard Donnelly: Yeah, so give her that.
[00:47:19] Gerard Donnelly: And maybe on Thursday, give her the other session, give her both.
[00:47:25] Gerard Donnelly: Okay.
[00:47:26] Gerard Donnelly: Then she can see it's not high intensity, all right?
[00:47:32] Gerard Donnelly: Yep.
[00:47:38] Abby Jorgensen: Okay.
[00:47:40] Abby Jorgensen: Let's see how she goes with the ride tomorrow.
[00:47:43] Gerard Donnelly: Has she picked out a venue and she understands out and back?
[00:47:47] Gerard Donnelly: Yeah.
[00:47:48] Abby Jorgensen: So yeah, the last one she did up in Canada.
[00:47:50] Abby Jorgensen: So this one will be, she's built down in Michigan.
[00:47:53] Gerard Donnelly: So.
[00:47:59] Gerard Donnelly: Oh, really good.
[00:48:01] Gerard Donnelly: Jesus.
[00:48:01] Gerard Donnelly: Yeah, she rode really well.
[00:48:03] Gerard Donnelly: It wasn't – I think she just went one long out and back.
[00:48:06] Abby Jorgensen: Yeah.
[00:48:07] Gerard Donnelly: Yeah.
[00:48:08] Gerard Donnelly: Tell me to do that differently next time.
[00:48:14] Gerard Donnelly: That's great.
[00:48:16] Gerard Donnelly: Yeah, for this one, make it, you know, definitely lots of out and backs for the 90.
[00:48:28] Gerard Donnelly: This we would probably change for 60 minutes, okay?
[00:48:35] Gerard Donnelly: Oh, like a FTP.
[00:48:37] Gerard Donnelly: Yeah, FTP.
[00:48:38] Gerard Donnelly: Yeah.
[00:48:41] Gerard Donnelly: Yeah.
[00:48:58] Gerard Donnelly: Okay.
[00:49:00] Gerard Donnelly: Okay.
[00:49:01] Abby Jorgensen: Yep.
[00:49:04] Gerard Donnelly: Anything else on Cindy?
[00:49:06] Gerard Donnelly: Nope.
[00:49:07] Gerard Donnelly: We're good there.
[00:49:08] Gerard Donnelly: She's good to communicate with?
[00:49:10] Gerard Donnelly: Yeah.
[00:49:11] Abby Jorgensen: She'll usually send me a message after a session, a long one, but she's a good communicator, so I like it.
[00:49:19] Abby Jorgensen: Yeah.
[00:49:21] Gerard Donnelly: Great.
[00:49:23] Gerard Donnelly: Isabella, a marathon?
[00:49:26] Gerard Donnelly: Marathon?
[00:49:28] Gerard Donnelly: Oh, my God.
[00:49:30] Abby Jorgensen: I mean, she's in Noosa right now, apparently.
[00:49:35] Gerard Donnelly: She can't train when she's in Noosa?
[00:49:37] Gerard Donnelly: Oh, my God.
[00:49:39] Abby Jorgensen: Well, I mean, but, yeah.
[00:49:46] Abby Jorgensen: I'm just trying to get her to the start line.
[00:49:49] Abby Jorgensen: Okay.
[00:49:50] Gerard Donnelly: Rick?
[00:49:52] Abby Jorgensen: Rick, he's just riding a Peloton with his power pedals attached to him.
[00:50:00] Abby Jorgensen: While his bicep...
[00:50:01] Abby Jorgensen: is healing.
[00:50:03] Gerard Donnelly: It's in a sling kind of thing.
[00:50:06] Gerard Donnelly: Has he got a race coming up?
[00:50:09] Gerard Donnelly: Yeah, he cancelled that one because he can't swim or run yet.
[00:50:14] Abby Jorgensen: But he's going to try to do the relay of that one, the bike.
[00:50:19] Abby Jorgensen: He's going to do the bike in a relay form.
[00:50:22] Gerard Donnelly: Of Morro Bay?
[00:50:23] Gerard Donnelly: Of Morro Bay, yeah.
[00:50:26] Gerard Donnelly: He's happy?
[00:50:27] Gerard Donnelly: No problem?
[00:50:28] Gerard Donnelly: Yeah, no problem.
[00:50:29] Gerard Donnelly: Just annoyed it.
[00:50:31] Gerard Donnelly: He has to go through all this.
[00:50:33] Gerard Donnelly: And can he run?
[00:50:34] Gerard Donnelly: Not yet.
[00:50:35] Gerard Donnelly: Not yet, no.
[00:50:36] Gerard Donnelly: Okay, how many weeks is that before he can run?
[00:50:40] Gerard Donnelly: A few weeks to the doctors.
[00:50:43] Gerard Donnelly: Yeah.
[00:50:44] Gerard Donnelly: That's great.
[00:50:45] Gerard Donnelly: You got him on the coleton.
[00:50:46] Gerard Donnelly: That's good.
[00:50:46] Gerard Donnelly: Once you can hold the handlebars, get him off that.
[00:50:49] Abby Jorgensen: Yeah.
[00:50:51] Gerard Donnelly: Michaela's week in USA, how did that go?
[00:50:53] Gerard Donnelly: It went really well.
[00:50:58] Gerard Donnelly: Let's see.
[00:51:00] Gerard Donnelly: Thanks.
[00:51:00] Gerard Donnelly: Let's Let's Let's Let's Let's
[00:51:01] Gerard Donnelly: It absolutely pissed it on me.
[00:51:08] Gerard Donnelly: Just wearing a wetsuit in the pool.
[00:51:12] Abby Jorgensen: Yeah, she tried it out.
[00:51:16] Abby Jorgensen: Let's see here.
[00:51:17] Abby Jorgensen: I'm trying to think what...
[00:51:19] Gerard Donnelly: She did a 60-minute FTP.
[00:51:21] Gerard Donnelly: Really good.
[00:51:22] Gerard Donnelly: Is she very well?
[00:51:24] Gerard Donnelly: Yeah, she wrote really well.
[00:51:25] Gerard Donnelly: She did the right course.
[00:51:27] Gerard Donnelly: That's a boring point.
[00:51:29] Gerard Donnelly: So good people listen.
[00:51:32] Abby Jorgensen: Oh, she's having fun.
[00:51:36] Gerard Donnelly: That's great.
[00:51:38] Gerard Donnelly: That's really good.
[00:51:40] Gerard Donnelly: How'd she go on the ride?
[00:51:44] Abby Jorgensen: I was 140, 59.
[00:51:49] Gerard Donnelly: Yeah.
[00:51:50] Gerard Donnelly: It's fantastic.
[00:51:52] Gerard Donnelly: Really good.
[00:51:53] Gerard Donnelly: It's going to be a PB for her, isn't it?
[00:51:55] Gerard Donnelly: Yep.
[00:51:58] Abby Jorgensen: I mean, she hasn't done an outdoor hour.
[00:52:00] Abby Jorgensen: care.
[00:52:01] Abby Jorgensen: Take Take Take Take care.
[00:52:01] Abby Jorgensen: care.
[00:52:01] Abby Jorgensen: Indoors, not far off from that.
[00:52:04] Gerard Donnelly: Yep, what's the 20-minute?
[00:52:08] Gerard Donnelly: I'm 64.
[00:52:09] Gerard Donnelly: So it was the second fastest 20-minute in the middle of a 60-minute by two watts.
[00:52:16] Gerard Donnelly: That's what you need to get that across to her.
[00:52:19] Gerard Donnelly: You you've just ridden for an hour what you did in June, you know, you've ridden two watts less than you did for 20 minutes.
[00:52:27] Gerard Donnelly: You did it for 60.
[00:52:30] Gerard Donnelly: Fantastic.
[00:52:31] Gerard Donnelly: Yeah, she was having doubts.
[00:52:32] Abby Jorgensen: She has lots of doubts when she was sick, and I told her it'll be fine.
[00:52:40] Gerard Donnelly: Good.
[00:52:42] Gerard Donnelly: Western Sydney, yep, okay.
[00:52:47] Gerard Donnelly: So she's back home now.
[00:52:50] Gerard Donnelly: Yep.
[00:52:52] Gerard Donnelly: She got a long run in, and...
[00:52:55] Gerard Donnelly: But you to ...
[00:52:56] Abby Jorgensen: ...
[00:52:56] Abby Jorgensen: ...
[00:52:57] Abby Jorgensen: ...
[00:52:58] Abby Jorgensen: Thank you.
[00:53:03] Gerard Donnelly: That's good.
[00:53:04] Gerard Donnelly: She's got two hours in.
[00:53:08] Gerard Donnelly: Very good.
[00:53:12] Abby Jorgensen: Anything about her?
[00:53:15] Abby Jorgensen: No, I think we're right on track because it's four weeks out, I think.
[00:53:22] Abby Jorgensen: Yep.
[00:53:24] Gerard Donnelly: Just keep checking that you're confident that she's running these off the bike at the pace she's going to run.
[00:53:30] Gerard Donnelly: Because is she a 6.45 pace in the race?
[00:53:34] Gerard Donnelly: I don't think so.
[00:53:35] Gerard Donnelly: What's that?
[00:53:37] Abby Jorgensen: Yeah, that's like him something.
[00:53:47] Gerard Donnelly: 10.53.
[00:53:48] Gerard Donnelly: Yeah, so.
[00:53:51] Gerard Donnelly: Oh, yeah.
[00:53:53] Gerard Donnelly: 7.06.
[00:53:57] Gerard Donnelly: That's not meant to be run hard, though.
[00:53:58] Gerard Donnelly: love it.
[00:53:59] Gerard Donnelly: Whoa.
[00:54:00] Gerard Donnelly: Whoa.
[00:54:01] Abby Jorgensen: Whoa.
[00:54:01] Abby Jorgensen: Whoa.
[00:54:01] Abby Jorgensen: Whoa.
[00:54:01] Abby Jorgensen: I'm sorry, what did we get each other?
[00:54:04] Abby Jorgensen: And I'm over the top of the summer night for the mermaids, overall.
[00:54:08] Abby Jorgensen: Is that the opposite?
[00:54:09] Abby Jorgensen: Is that opposite?
[00:54:10] Abby Jorgensen: Is there we now are out of the lion?
[00:54:12] Abby Jorgensen: No, that's result of the mermaids tail.
[00:54:14] Abby Jorgensen: It's a cool stuff up.
[00:54:15] Abby Jorgensen: Well, these districts are related to that fresh fruit gene in all of the different worlds.
[00:54:21] Gerard Donnelly: Other than strong gifts.
[00:54:23] Gerard Donnelly: It's fast as you can run.
[00:54:24] Gerard Donnelly: Oof.
[00:54:25] Gerard Donnelly: That was actually a 10K, was it?
[00:54:27] Gerard Donnelly: Jeez.
[00:54:28] Gerard Donnelly: Mm-hmm.
[00:54:28] Gerard Donnelly: Okay.
[00:54:29] Gerard Donnelly: Well, you've got that right.
[00:54:50] Abby Jorgensen: Can you just turn that background down?
[00:54:54] Abby Jorgensen: Oh, yeah.
[00:54:59] Abby Jorgensen: It's funny.
[00:55:00] Gerard Donnelly: How it picks it up so loud.
[00:55:01] Abby Jorgensen: Like it wasn't, it's been the same.
[00:55:05] Abby Jorgensen: Yeah.
[00:55:06] Gerard Donnelly: Seems to be getting louder.
[00:55:09] Gerard Donnelly: She's going snowboarding.
[00:55:10] Gerard Donnelly: Oh no.
[00:55:11] Abby Jorgensen: I told her, she's questioning that.
[00:55:14] Abby Jorgensen: And I told her to be careful if she does.
[00:55:17] Abby Jorgensen: I told her her training comes first and then if she's done with it, she can go snowboarding.
[00:55:21] Abby Jorgensen: Is she going to Queenstown, is she?
[00:55:24] Gerard Donnelly: She must be.
[00:55:25] Abby Jorgensen: I don't know.
[00:55:26] Gerard Donnelly: Ironically, Jordan goes there on Wednesday, Thursday, Friday.
[00:55:31] Gerard Donnelly: Okay.
[00:55:32] Gerard Donnelly: Anything else on McKayla?
[00:55:34] Gerard Donnelly: No, we're good.
[00:55:35] Gerard Donnelly: Yep.
[00:55:36] Abby Jorgensen: Rhianna?
[00:55:37] Abby Jorgensen: I mean, I think she started training yesterday and today after some COVID and then work travel.
[00:55:46] Gerard Donnelly: Yeah.
[00:55:47] Gerard Donnelly: Yeah.
[00:55:47] Abby Jorgensen: We're just trying to get back into the swing of things.
[00:55:49] Abby Jorgensen: She registered for Copenhagen for next year as the Boulder Marathon, but they were going to cancel it, but then they can't get their money back.
[00:55:59] Abby Jorgensen: So they're just going to do what they can.
[00:56:02] Gerard Donnelly: Can she do a half marathon there?
[00:56:06] Abby Jorgensen: I'll ask if that's an option.
[00:56:08] Abby Jorgensen: It's probably the better option for her.
[00:56:10] Gerard Donnelly: Even if she goes there, I don't know if they run the half marathon, because normally they have a half marathon 10K in marathon in one day, normally.
[00:56:19] Gerard Donnelly: And even if you've got a marathon number, you can just do the half.
[00:56:25] Gerard Donnelly: First of all, you can ask them if you can switch out of the marathon into the half.
[00:56:28] Gerard Donnelly: And as they say, no, just do your own.
[00:56:32] Gerard Donnelly: You've got a number.
[00:56:35] Gerard Donnelly: Older-thon, let me see.
[00:56:38] Abby Jorgensen: Yeah, they probably have a half marathon as well.
[00:56:42] Abby Jorgensen: Yeah, they have a 5, 10, half.
[00:56:45] Abby Jorgensen: Yeah.
[00:56:46] Gerard Donnelly: Yep, I'd just tell her to do the half or the 10, even.
[00:56:50] Gerard Donnelly: Yeah, whenever you think she's capable with her sickness.
[00:56:59] Gerard Donnelly: Yeah, the marathon would be a ridiculous thing to do.
[00:57:01] Gerard Donnelly: podeall.
[00:57:01] Gerard Donnelly: you're
[00:57:01] Gerard Donnelly: Yeah, she knows that, too.
[00:57:05] Gerard Donnelly: So tell her, you know, you've spoken to me, and we think that if you can get into the 10K or the half marathon, and if they don't like to swap over, just change to those races yourself.
[00:57:19] Gerard Donnelly: Okay.
[00:57:22] Gerard Donnelly: Has she tested after her sickness?
[00:57:25] Gerard Donnelly: No.
[00:57:26] Gerard Donnelly: When's the last time she tested?
[00:57:31] Abby Jorgensen: Probably before she left for Colorado.
[00:57:33] Abby Jorgensen: That's a long time ago, isn't it?
[00:57:35] Gerard Donnelly: Yeah.
[00:57:35] Abby Jorgensen: And then she, well, as soon as she got to Colorado, she had work trips and everything.
[00:57:40] Gerard Donnelly: I'd say she needs to do a test, and you would have to sell it to her.
[00:57:45] Gerard Donnelly: Like, we just don't know where you're at, you know?
[00:57:48] Gerard Donnelly: Yeah.
[00:57:51] Gerard Donnelly: So it'd be really good.
[00:57:56] Gerard Donnelly: Yeah.
[00:57:59] Gerard Donnelly: Abby, I'd be really reluctant.
[00:58:01] Gerard Donnelly: Thank you.
[00:58:01] Gerard Donnelly: For you to give someone who you think is just coming out of sickness too long a ride on the, yes, on today, you know, it's got to be a bit careful you don't progress it too quickly.
[00:58:19] Gerard Donnelly: So you're giving her three to four and a half hours, it's probably too much, but she's actually only up two hours anyway.
[00:58:25] Abby Jorgensen: I never know, they have a bunch ride on the Saturday there in Boulder, so I never know.
[00:58:30] Gerard Donnelly: Yes, okay, yep, yep, so are you, you're giving her mainly a running program for the marathons that we, that we, yeah, that's what I had been doing.
[00:58:44] Gerard Donnelly: Yep.
[00:58:46] Gerard Donnelly: Is there any triathlons coming out?
[00:58:48] Gerard Donnelly: No?
[00:58:49] Gerard Donnelly: No, she's looking for a 70.3, but.
[00:58:51] Abby Jorgensen: Okay.
[00:58:52] Gerard Donnelly: Just find one.
[00:58:53] Gerard Donnelly: Well, we don't need to test her then.
[00:58:55] Gerard Donnelly: She's not, she's not riding high intensity, we don't need to test her, that's fine.
[00:58:59] Gerard Donnelly: Okay.
[00:59:00] Gerard Donnelly: And, but.
[00:59:01] Gerard Donnelly: I'll give her a 10K probably next week.
[00:59:09] Gerard Donnelly: That way you're going to have some data to give her advice about when she goes to race.
[00:59:17] Gerard Donnelly: Okay?
[00:59:18] Gerard Donnelly: Yep.
[00:59:19] Gerard Donnelly: Blair?
[00:59:21] Abby Jorgensen: Blair's just getting ready for a long, like, what would he say, 600?
[00:59:30] Abby Jorgensen: It's just a long ride, a week of long riding, a charity ride, so it's, like, basically a ride with some running and swimming in between.
[00:59:38] Abby Jorgensen: Yep.
[00:59:39] Abby Jorgensen: But he registered for Ironman, what is it, the one in Canada, next August.
[00:59:49] Gerard Donnelly: Okay, a year in advance, right?
[00:59:52] Gerard Donnelly: Yep.
[00:59:52] Gerard Donnelly: Okay.
[00:59:53] Gerard Donnelly: Yep.
[00:59:53] Abby Jorgensen: And he'll probably do the same 70.3 he did this year, or one of the ones right there in Canada in early summer.
[01:00:01] Abby Jorgensen: Yep.
[01:00:07] Gerard Donnelly: Okay, I'm just hiding that.
[01:00:10] Gerard Donnelly: You can't see it.
[01:00:12] Gerard Donnelly: I just, I like to have something that they, when you and I talk, and I can, I just keep, I'll just keep moving it so it makes it easy for me.
[01:00:23] Gerard Donnelly: And so it's good to just keep pushing him on the bike.
[01:00:27] Gerard Donnelly: And just remember, even though they're training for long endurance events, the quickest way to develop their fitness is to give them one hard session each week.
[01:00:38] Gerard Donnelly: Okay.
[01:00:39] Gerard Donnelly: There's so much evidence.
[01:00:39] Gerard Donnelly: Just because someone's training for a long endurance ride doesn't mean all the rides have to be long and slow.
[01:00:46] Gerard Donnelly: So it's super important that you keep their FTP up to date every fourth week, and you give them one.
[01:00:53] Gerard Donnelly: Whether it's the VO2 sets or the VO2 mix with threshold, you know, the 10 minutes, 3 by 30, 30 on.
[01:01:01] Gerard Donnelly: 30 off, 10 minutes, 30 on, 30 off.
[01:01:04] Gerard Donnelly: There's VO2 with threshold.
[01:01:06] Gerard Donnelly: Just give him one of those each week.
[01:01:08] Gerard Donnelly: Okay?
[01:01:10] Gerard Donnelly: All right.
[01:01:13] Gerard Donnelly: Glenn?
[01:01:16] Abby Jorgensen: He probably is getting up for his marathon right now.
[01:01:20] Gerard Donnelly: Oh, my goodness.
[01:01:23] Gerard Donnelly: What do you think he can run?
[01:01:26] Abby Jorgensen: Probably between that 3.20 and 3.30.
[01:01:29] Abby Jorgensen: Okay.
[01:01:32] Gerard Donnelly: He's in Bali.
[01:01:34] Gerard Donnelly: Yep.
[01:01:34] Gerard Donnelly: Yeah.
[01:01:36] Abby Jorgensen: He's been running pretty well, so.
[01:01:42] Gerard Donnelly: 1.13.
[01:01:47] Gerard Donnelly: Ooh.
[01:01:51] Gerard Donnelly: I don't Once he's...
[01:01:55] Gerard Donnelly: Has he done a half marathon race?
[01:01:58] Gerard Donnelly: don't know.
[01:01:58] Gerard Donnelly: don't don't I don't know.
[01:02:00] Gerard Donnelly: I don't I don't don't know.
[01:02:03] Abby Jorgensen: It was Iron Man.
[01:03:01] Gerard Donnelly: It was Iron Man.
[01:03:09] Gerard Donnelly: There's not a lot of evidence to say that he can run 4.47.
[01:03:13] Gerard Donnelly: Like, there's a half marathon at 4.53.
[01:03:19] Gerard Donnelly: I'm a little bit worried about that pace.
[01:03:24] Gerard Donnelly: And that made me change it.
[01:03:28] Abby Jorgensen: We were both, when we were talking, we were kind of on the fence of deciding.
[01:03:33] Abby Jorgensen: I told him, obviously, it was just a guide, but you know how Glenn is very, he wants to do.
[01:03:40] Abby Jorgensen: The Dutch way.
[01:03:43] Gerard Donnelly: How did he cope with that 30K?
[01:03:46] Gerard Donnelly: I'm trying to remember.
[01:03:48] Abby Jorgensen: didn't go as great as he wanted it to.
[01:03:54] Gerard Donnelly: I reckon, when did you last speak to him?
[01:03:58] Abby Jorgensen: A couple days ago.
[01:04:01] Abby Jorgensen: Yeah.
[01:04:02] Abby Jorgensen: What day is it today?
[01:04:03] Abby Jorgensen: Saturday?
[01:04:04] Abby Jorgensen: Like Thursday?
[01:04:05] Gerard Donnelly: What was his goal?
[01:04:06] Gerard Donnelly: Were you on a break 3.30 or anything?
[01:04:08] Gerard Donnelly: he have a particular goal?
[01:04:09] Abby Jorgensen: Yeah, his goal is, yeah, to break 3.30 because he's done a 3.30 before.
[01:04:15] Abby Jorgensen: Yeah.
[01:04:16] Gerard Donnelly: Did he do that in Bali or did he do that in the Netherlands?
[01:04:19] Gerard Donnelly: I can't remember.
[01:04:20] Gerard Donnelly: Netherlands, probably.
[01:04:22] Gerard Donnelly: Yeah, so it's just a completely different beast in Bali.
[01:04:26] Gerard Donnelly: The heat, you know, you've experienced it.
[01:04:29] Gerard Donnelly: You can't run the same.
[01:04:30] Gerard Donnelly: Yeah.
[01:04:46] Gerard Donnelly: The trouble is, going to wake up, and this is the worst thing to do, is he sees a different plan.
[01:04:52] Gerard Donnelly: You know what mean?
[01:04:53] Gerard Donnelly: Yeah.
[01:04:57] Abby Jorgensen: You what I mean?
[01:05:01] Abby Jorgensen: Thanks,
[01:05:08] Abby Jorgensen: I could message him and just be like, tell him that we're just going to try to be conservative and if he needs to go, if he feels like he can go faster, he can go faster.
[01:05:30] Gerard Donnelly: Thank you.
[01:05:50] Gerard Donnelly: Thank you.
[01:06:12] Gerard Donnelly: Thank you.
[01:06:42] Gerard Donnelly: I'm still on the 329, I'm trying to make it.
[01:06:53] Gerard Donnelly: So Abby, I think you need to just change those settings, okay?
[01:07:01] Gerard Donnelly: Okay.
[01:07:01] Gerard Donnelly: Okay.
[01:07:02] Gerard Donnelly: Okay.
[01:07:12] Gerard Donnelly: And that's still going to get him under 3.30, but, you know, I think that's more realistic five-minute K pace.
[01:07:18] Gerard Donnelly: Yeah.
[01:07:22] Gerard Donnelly: It's in Bali, and he hasn't done anything that, you know, I could be totally wrong, but it just seems...
[01:07:32] Gerard Donnelly: What did he do when he's half Ironman?
[01:07:38] Abby Jorgensen: What take was that?
[01:07:41] Abby Jorgensen: Man.
[01:07:44] Abby Jorgensen: There it is.
[01:07:46] Gerard Donnelly: So he ran 5.08 pace.
[01:07:53] Gerard Donnelly: Where was that?
[01:07:55] Gerard Donnelly: was in Indonesia, so where was it in Vietnam?
[01:08:00] Gerard Donnelly: Vietnam, right, okay.
[01:08:03] Gerard Donnelly: So that's pretty hot there.
[01:08:05] Gerard Donnelly: Yeah.
[01:08:07] Abby Jorgensen: So he always goes out too hard.
[01:08:08] Gerard Donnelly: Yeah.
[01:08:10] Gerard Donnelly: 450s and finishes at 530s, you know.
[01:08:16] Gerard Donnelly: So we just want him to start, just send him a message saying, listen, Gerard and I have discussed your strategy.
[01:08:22] Gerard Donnelly: We just want you to slow down earlier.
[01:08:31] Gerard Donnelly: I think I have to change this again.
[01:08:33] Gerard Donnelly: Sorry.
[01:08:34] Gerard Donnelly: You're fine.
[01:08:36] Abby Jorgensen: I'll message him.
[01:08:37] Abby Jorgensen: I'll message him.
[01:09:12] Abby Jorgensen: Thank you.
[01:09:35] Gerard Donnelly: Yeah, I'm going try that.
[01:09:37] Gerard Donnelly: But we're just wanting to be a little bit more conservative, really.
[01:09:42] Gerard Donnelly: Mm-hmm.
[01:09:56] Gerard Donnelly: Yeah.
[01:10:00] Gerard Donnelly: I might get feeling it.
[01:10:02] Gerard Donnelly: You'll be struggling to be running 520s by the end.
[01:10:06] Gerard Donnelly: That's what I think is going to happen.
[01:10:08] Gerard Donnelly: Instead of running faster, you'll be running slower.
[01:10:16] Gerard Donnelly: So 1k, 4k, 35k.
[01:10:27] Gerard Donnelly: Okay?
[01:10:28] Gerard Donnelly: Okay.
[01:10:57] Gerard Donnelly: Thank you much.
[01:10:59] Gerard Donnelly: you so much.
[01:11:01] Gerard Donnelly: You
[01:11:11] Gerard Donnelly: Thank you.
[01:11:32] Gerard Donnelly: Okay, let's just go with that.
[01:11:36] Abby Jorgensen: What's his next thing?
[01:11:38] Abby Jorgensen: Iron Man, or the Busselton.
[01:11:42] Abby Jorgensen: Oh, Busselton, okay.
[01:11:43] Gerard Donnelly: So the week after this run, this marathon, it's basically nothing for the first three days, okay?
[01:11:57] Gerard Donnelly: So don't let him ride or run or swim.
[01:12:00] Gerard Donnelly: Just walk.
[01:12:02] Gerard Donnelly: you.
[01:12:02] Gerard Donnelly: Thank
[01:12:02] Gerard Donnelly: Just do walking, he's going to be super sore from this, and then nothing hard, you have to move all this, so Wednesday you can do swim, Thursday you can do recovery ride, Friday you can do another swim, so that would be right, that would be right, and just get rid of the run, you can't run after that marathon.
[01:12:27] Gerard Donnelly: I don't let him run for five or seven days, and swim's good there, you can do a zone two ride, that's all right for next week, all that stuff, that's really good, nothing hard, okay, and the runners as well, so you're just trying to do that zone two's correct, and just give him, an easy run here for, you know, 40 minutes.
[01:13:02] Gerard Donnelly: 30 or 40 minutes.
[01:13:03] Gerard Donnelly: Okay.
[01:13:04] Gerard Donnelly: Okay.
[01:13:05] Gerard Donnelly: And then just walking here.
[01:13:06] Gerard Donnelly: Put in recovery walks.
[01:13:11] Gerard Donnelly: You know, 10, 15 minutes recovery walks.
[01:13:15] Gerard Donnelly: Okay.
[01:13:16] Gerard Donnelly: Okay.
[01:13:17] Gerard Donnelly: All right.
[01:13:17] Gerard Donnelly: Jordan.
[01:13:19] Gerard Donnelly: So you might have already started the marathon.
[01:13:22] Gerard Donnelly: It's 7am.
[01:13:23] Gerard Donnelly: I'm sure.
[01:13:25] Gerard Donnelly: Is it?
[01:13:26] Abby Jorgensen: Yeah.
[01:13:28] Abby Jorgensen: What time does the race start?
[01:13:33] Abby Jorgensen: It's 7am in Bali now.
[01:13:35] Gerard Donnelly: So yeah, I wouldn't worry too much.
[01:13:40] Gerard Donnelly: You know, you can leave a message saying be more conservative, but that's all you can say.
[01:13:45] Gerard Donnelly: Yeah.
[01:13:46] Abby Jorgensen: Okay.
[01:13:47] Gerard Donnelly: Okay.
[01:13:50] Gerard Donnelly: Dre Boy, how's he going?
[01:13:54] Abby Jorgensen: Pretty good.
[01:13:55] Abby Jorgensen: mean, he has some, some work interruptions, some, I don't know, some event he was working.
[01:14:02] Abby Jorgensen: yesterday.
[01:14:03] Abby Jorgensen: He thought he might be able to get in the ride, but it's neat.
[01:14:13] Abby Jorgensen: I told him to look for some triathlons whenever the weather turns there and they start having triathlons.
[01:14:22] Abby Jorgensen: Look for some smaller ones.
[01:14:24] Gerard Donnelly: Yeah, and he can also, you know, when we test him, because he did the marathon, didn't he?
[01:14:32] Gerard Donnelly: Half marathon.
[01:14:33] Abby Jorgensen: Yeah, and then we just tested his FTP as well.
[01:14:36] Gerard Donnelly: And we can start to give him some 10k runs and stuff, testing.
[01:14:43] Gerard Donnelly: He can jump in a park run or he can find a 10k race.
[01:14:49] Gerard Donnelly: Yeah, give him some goals.
[01:14:55] Gerard Donnelly: Okay.
[01:14:56] Gerard Donnelly: Okay.
[01:14:58] Gerard Donnelly: Okay.
[01:15:01] Gerard Donnelly: Philippe.
[01:15:01] Abby Jorgensen: He's doing good.
[01:15:02] Abby Jorgensen: Good.
[01:15:02] Abby Jorgensen: I just talked to him today.
[01:15:04] Abby Jorgensen: He has 5K, and then he did the 60-minute FTP, which he executed that pretty well.
[01:15:13] Abby Jorgensen: What's his event?
[01:15:15] Abby Jorgensen: He has that one.
[01:15:21] Abby Jorgensen: That's it right now.
[01:15:22] Abby Jorgensen: Yep.
[01:15:26] Gerard Donnelly: Yep, okay.
[01:15:36] Gerard Donnelly: And he did his 5K today?
[01:15:37] Gerard Donnelly: Yep.
[01:15:40] Gerard Donnelly: So he did his 20-minute and his 5K.
[01:15:48] Gerard Donnelly: He did that indoor, did he?
[01:15:52] Abby Jorgensen: Yeah, he did an indoor one, and then I had him do an outdoor one.
[01:15:56] Abby Jorgensen: He improved on his last one?
[01:15:58] Gerard Donnelly: Yep.
[01:15:59] Gerard Donnelly: 235, oh, great.
[01:16:01] Gerard Donnelly: Great.
[01:16:02] Gerard Donnelly: Oh, 15 watts, could be happier with that.
[01:16:11] Gerard Donnelly: He did 208.
[01:16:13] Gerard Donnelly: So what's his FTP?
[01:16:16] Gerard Donnelly: 235, that's takeoff.
[01:16:20] Gerard Donnelly: 222?
[01:16:21] Gerard Donnelly: 221?
[01:16:22] Gerard Donnelly: Is that right?
[01:16:23] Gerard Donnelly: 221?
[01:16:25] Gerard Donnelly: 23.
[01:16:32] Gerard Donnelly: That's right, 223.
[01:16:34] Gerard Donnelly: So he's done 208, okay, for 60 minutes.
[01:16:38] Gerard Donnelly: So that kind of shows you, you know, his indoor is higher than his outdoor FTP, which we all, we know all the time, don't we?
[01:16:49] Gerard Donnelly: But that's good.
[01:16:52] Gerard Donnelly: He needs to hear that, though, you know.
[01:16:54] Gerard Donnelly: Yeah, that's why we test you indoor and outdoor, because they're...
[01:16:57] Gerard Donnelly: Yeah, I told him that today.
[01:16:58] Abby Jorgensen: was like, you're outdoors where we ride, so.
[01:17:02] Abby Jorgensen: it's going to be our true indicator of everything.
[01:17:09] Gerard Donnelly: Is he much of a runner?
[01:17:11] Abby Jorgensen: Yeah, I mean, I think he's a pretty decent runner.
[01:17:14] Abby Jorgensen: He was about an eight-minute pace today or five.
[01:17:17] Gerard Donnelly: Did he do 10K today?
[01:17:19] Gerard Donnelly: No, did five.
[01:17:23] Gerard Donnelly: Oh, five minutes.
[01:17:26] Gerard Donnelly: That's not bad.
[01:17:28] Abby Jorgensen: So it started a little hot, but he held on for the most part.
[01:17:36] Gerard Donnelly: Yeah, he did.
[01:17:38] Gerard Donnelly: Yep, that's good.
[01:17:41] Gerard Donnelly: Very good.
[01:17:42] Gerard Donnelly: So back into it next week then.
[01:17:44] Gerard Donnelly: Yep.
[01:17:48] Gerard Donnelly: And so that's his Monday, really, is it?
[01:17:51] Gerard Donnelly: Yeah, that's his Monday.
[01:17:53] Gerard Donnelly: Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday.
[01:17:57] Abby Jorgensen: Yeah, he likes to swim on Tuesday, Thursday, or like whatever.
[01:18:02] Gerard Donnelly: Yep.
[01:18:03] Gerard Donnelly: So he's training for an Olympic, isn't he, at the moment?
[01:18:06] Gerard Donnelly: Mm-hmm.
[01:18:10] Gerard Donnelly: Was there anything else he's training for after that?
[01:18:13] Gerard Donnelly: I don't think he'd pick something, but he's been in an Olympic, like he likes that Olympic distance.
[01:18:19] Gerard Donnelly: That's great.
[01:18:19] Gerard Donnelly: If there's more Olympics you can do, that's...
[01:18:21] Gerard Donnelly: Yeah.
[01:18:27] Gerard Donnelly: Good.
[01:18:28] Gerard Donnelly: Good.
[01:18:29] Gerard Donnelly: And those, is he, he's got an outdoor course that he used for that one?
[01:18:35] Gerard Donnelly: Yep.
[01:18:36] Abby Jorgensen: Because the week prior he did, did another good set, like a Olympic distance race recognition really well.
[01:18:45] Gerard Donnelly: Interesting circuit.
[01:18:46] Gerard Donnelly: Yeah.
[01:18:48] Abby Jorgensen: Looks like a little, like a loop.
[01:18:56] Gerard Donnelly: I've got another guy, Beecher, lives in Montreal.
[01:18:58] Gerard Donnelly: I should get Beecher to do that.
[01:19:01] Gerard Donnelly: That loop.
[01:19:02] Gerard Donnelly: That
[01:19:02] Gerard Donnelly: That's a beauty.
[01:19:08] Gerard Donnelly: 33 k's an hour.
[01:19:13] Gerard Donnelly: 33, yep.
[01:19:16] Gerard Donnelly: What is that, like 21, 22?
[01:19:18] Gerard Donnelly: Yep.
[01:19:19] Gerard Donnelly: It's got a few rises, hasn't it?
[01:19:25] Gerard Donnelly: No, it's got five metres.
[01:19:27] Gerard Donnelly: Jeez, that puts you off, doesn't it?
[01:19:30] Gerard Donnelly: That look like a massive hill.
[01:19:32] Abby Jorgensen: Yeah, like every time I look at any of America, I mean, here in America, I'm like, oh, there's some hills, and then I'm like, oh, wait, it's not really a hill.
[01:19:42] Gerard Donnelly: Yeah, okay.
[01:19:43] Gerard Donnelly: I don't know.
[01:19:44] Abby Jorgensen: Training Peak throws it off a lot.
[01:19:46] Gerard Donnelly: Is he really cope with an hour 40 long run?
[01:19:49] Gerard Donnelly: Is that okay for him?
[01:19:51] Abby Jorgensen: Yeah, we've been building up to that, and he did a half marathon.
[01:19:55] Abby Jorgensen: Easy to, that's right, yep.
[01:19:59] Gerard Donnelly: Good, that's a good program.
[01:20:03] Gerard Donnelly: Just making sure, if he's got the time, the key is to make sure that we do do one of the runs with some tempo intervals, okay?
[01:20:13] Gerard Donnelly: Okay.
[01:20:18] Gerard Donnelly: So I would say this run should be tempo intervals.
[01:20:23] Gerard Donnelly: Okay.
[01:20:25] Abby Jorgensen: There's like the steady state stuff?
[01:20:28] Gerard Donnelly: No, tempo intervals are a bit faster than that.
[01:20:30] Gerard Donnelly: So it's like sub-threshold.
[01:20:35] Gerard Donnelly: You know the tempo intervals we do?
[01:20:37] Gerard Donnelly: Yeah.
[01:20:38] Gerard Donnelly: Three by eights or the three by tens or four by eight.
[01:20:45] Gerard Donnelly: Has he got time?
[01:20:47] Gerard Donnelly: What's his work schedule?
[01:20:48] Gerard Donnelly: Is he doing that?
[01:20:51] Abby Jorgensen: Yeah, he usually has time, I think.
[01:20:56] Abby Jorgensen: Because he said on Tuesday, Thursday, he'll do a strength swim and then go back to the gym.
[01:21:00] Abby Jorgensen: And do a strength session on Tuesday.
[01:21:05] Gerard Donnelly: If he doesn't have time, separate the morning and afternoon.
[01:21:12] Gerard Donnelly: We need, you know, the runs to be 40 minutes minimum up to an hour, so depending on who the athlete is.
[01:21:23] Gerard Donnelly: So these two runs have to be minimum 40, but I would like to see tempo there.
[01:21:31] Gerard Donnelly: And, you know, three by eight is a good starting point, which I can grab for you.
[01:21:47] Abby Jorgensen: Oh, okay, those, the ones under the 70.3, that's probably why it threw me off.
[01:21:52] Gerard Donnelly: Yeah, and reduce the recovery to...
[01:22:05] Gerard Donnelly: It's really, you know, easy recovery.
[01:22:08] Gerard Donnelly: Walk, jog sort of thing.
[01:22:11] Gerard Donnelly: And, yeah, just got to check that he can cope with that pace, that five-minute K pace.
[01:22:19] Gerard Donnelly: What was his half-marathon?
[01:22:25] Gerard Donnelly: I can't remember.
[01:22:29] Abby Jorgensen: That'd be like a 5.30 something.
[01:22:32] Abby Jorgensen: 6.03.
[01:22:33] Gerard Donnelly: Yeah, so that might be a bit quick.
[01:22:36] Gerard Donnelly: Just have a check, you know, with Macmillan.
[01:22:44] Gerard Donnelly: Plug in his half-marathon pace for Macmillan.
[01:22:47] Gerard Donnelly: Okay, let's see.
[01:22:59] Gerard Donnelly: I can do it now.
[01:23:00] Gerard Donnelly: I've got it here.-marathon.
[01:23:01] Gerard Donnelly: I'm to...
[01:23:01] Gerard Donnelly: ...
[01:23:02] Gerard Donnelly: ...
[01:23:02] Gerard Donnelly: ...
[01:23:02] Gerard Donnelly: ...
[01:23:02] Gerard Donnelly: ...
[01:23:02] Gerard Donnelly: 208.
[01:23:03] Gerard Donnelly: 208.
[01:23:04] Abby Jorgensen: That's 21.3.
[01:23:17] Abby Jorgensen: No, it's 7.
[01:23:31] Gerard Donnelly: Okay, his tempo interval should be at 5.33 to 5.44, Pax, according to Macmillan.
[01:23:41] Abby Jorgensen: Okay.
[01:23:50] Gerard Donnelly: Okay.
[01:23:54] Gerard Donnelly: Okay.
[01:23:55] Gerard Donnelly: Okay.
[01:23:58] Gerard Donnelly: Okay.
[01:23:59] Gerard Donnelly: Okay.
[01:23:59] Gerard Donnelly: Okay.
[01:24:01] Gerard Donnelly: Okay.
[01:24:02] Gerard Donnelly: Okay.
[01:24:02] Gerard Donnelly: Okay.
[01:24:02] Gerard Donnelly: Thank
[01:24:09] Gerard Donnelly: Is that with us, that 10k, was it?
[01:24:13] Abby Jorgensen: What's that date?
[01:24:14] Abby Jorgensen: Yeah, it should have been.
[01:24:15] Abby Jorgensen: So that'll change it.
[01:24:22] Gerard Donnelly: So it proves he doesn't have the endurance, does it?
[01:24:26] Gerard Donnelly: So according to his half marathon race that he did, his 10k should be 57 minutes.
[01:24:34] Gerard Donnelly: So it's way too slow, because he's already ran with us 53.
[01:24:43] Gerard Donnelly: Okay, so now Macmillan's saying his tempo should be 5.14 to 5.25.
[01:25:16] Gerard Donnelly: It's too fast.
[01:25:18] Gerard Donnelly: We can't do that.
[01:25:22] Gerard Donnelly: We'll just make this 90, just for this week, make it 96 to 90 to 100.
[01:25:28] Gerard Donnelly: Okay.
[01:25:38] Gerard Donnelly: It's still too fast.
[01:25:40] Gerard Donnelly: There's something wrong.
[01:25:41] Gerard Donnelly: There's something wrong here.
[01:25:52] Gerard Donnelly: His run speed's set too fast.
[01:25:54] Gerard Donnelly: That's what's wrong.
[01:26:00] Gerard Donnelly: 523.
[01:26:01] Gerard Donnelly: Where did get that from?
[01:26:02] Gerard Donnelly: I don't know, is that from his 5k?
[01:26:08] Gerard Donnelly: No?
[01:26:08] Gerard Donnelly: You do a 5k?
[01:26:09] Gerard Donnelly: He did a 5k today.
[01:26:11] Gerard Donnelly: Oh, okay.
[01:26:13] Gerard Donnelly: What was it?
[01:26:17] Abby Jorgensen: I think he ran right, like a 4.59 pace.
[01:26:29] Gerard Donnelly: Can you look that up?
[01:26:30] Gerard Donnelly: Yeah.
[01:26:49] Gerard Donnelly: What did you get?
[01:26:51] Abby Jorgensen: Yes, well, 7.59 per mile, so that's like basically a 5-minute kilometer pace.
[01:27:12] Abby Jorgensen: Yeah, okay.
[01:27:13] Gerard Donnelly: Well, that's, threshold is 525, which he's got it set at 506, that's what's wrong.
[01:27:20] Gerard Donnelly: For some reason.
[01:27:35] Gerard Donnelly: So he's run 457 today.
[01:27:41] Gerard Donnelly: It's 523.
[01:27:55] Gerard Donnelly: That's about right.
[01:27:56] Gerard Donnelly: That's better.
[01:27:57] Abby Jorgensen: What looks better?
[01:27:59] Abby Jorgensen: Let's try that for this week.
[01:28:01] Gerard Donnelly: Okay.
[01:28:02] Gerard Donnelly: Okay.
[01:28:04] Gerard Donnelly: And we don't have to make it so long, good, okay, you've got him right, that's good.
[01:28:42] Abby Jorgensen: Aaron.
[01:28:44] Abby Jorgensen: Aaron, we're just trying to get back into the swing of things.
[01:28:50] Abby Jorgensen: What's she aiming for, anything?
[01:28:52] Abby Jorgensen: No, she hasn't, she's waiting for this injury to clear up.
[01:28:56] Gerard Donnelly: What's she got again, Abby?
[01:28:58] Abby Jorgensen: Like a hip, she had like a hip, some hip spurs.
[01:29:03] Gerard Donnelly: And things like that.
[01:29:05] Abby Jorgensen: So it's finally getting to the point where she can handle some intensity.
[01:29:11] Abby Jorgensen: So last week, she felt a little better.
[01:29:14] Abby Jorgensen: I don't know.
[01:29:15] Abby Jorgensen: I know she ran.
[01:29:17] Abby Jorgensen: I don't know why it didn't show up.
[01:29:19] Abby Jorgensen: I should text her.
[01:29:21] Abby Jorgensen: I know she ran.
[01:29:23] Abby Jorgensen: I don't know why.
[01:29:24] Abby Jorgensen: Yeah.
[01:29:24] Abby Jorgensen: But she's been riding the Peloton because it's a less aggressive angle for her hip right now.
[01:29:29] Gerard Donnelly: Yeah.
[01:29:30] Abby Jorgensen: And then.
[01:29:31] Abby Jorgensen: Yeah.
[01:29:32] Abby Jorgensen: So her biggest thing is she just wants to get back into a routine right now because it's struggling with that.
[01:29:39] Gerard Donnelly: Yeah.
[01:29:40] Gerard Donnelly: I don't know why.
[01:29:41] Gerard Donnelly: When I look at her photo.
[01:29:44] Gerard Donnelly: She laughed at me.
[01:29:46] Abby Jorgensen: She's like, what does Gerard think I am?
[01:29:48] Abby Jorgensen: I was like, she's like, I'm 5'11".
[01:29:49] Abby Jorgensen: I'm like, I don't know.
[01:29:51] Abby Jorgensen: Yeah.
[01:29:52] Gerard Donnelly: That makes sense.
[01:29:53] Gerard Donnelly: She looks so lean.
[01:29:55] Gerard Donnelly: Yeah.
[01:29:56] Gerard Donnelly: mean, she's, I mean, yeah, I think she's just, you're used to me.
[01:30:01] Gerard Donnelly: I'm 5'11".
[01:30:02] Gerard Donnelly: I'm-4".-8".-9.-9.
[01:30:04] Gerard Donnelly: All right.
[01:30:06] Gerard Donnelly: Riley.
[01:30:08] Abby Jorgensen: He tested this week and did really well.
[01:30:12] Abby Jorgensen: So improved on everything.
[01:30:16] Abby Jorgensen: That's great.
[01:30:18] Abby Jorgensen: He retested his.
[01:30:19] Abby Jorgensen: He did get a bike fit yesterday.
[01:30:21] Abby Jorgensen: Was it yesterday?
[01:30:22] Abby Jorgensen: Yeah.
[01:30:23] Gerard Donnelly: Okay.
[01:30:23] Gerard Donnelly: Yep.
[01:30:25] Abby Jorgensen: So he's good to go there.
[01:30:26] Abby Jorgensen: They like, I think they shaved off some of his aero bars and raised up his cockpit a little bit.
[01:30:34] Gerard Donnelly: So Riley has gone from 169 to 177 to 189.
[01:30:41] Gerard Donnelly: Is that right?
[01:30:43] Gerard Donnelly: Yeah.
[01:30:43] Gerard Donnelly: I think that one wasn't with us.
[01:30:45] Abby Jorgensen: I don't know where they pulled that one from.
[01:30:48] Gerard Donnelly: I don't know.
[01:30:49] Abby Jorgensen: Previous.
[01:30:50] Abby Jorgensen: 30 minute.
[01:30:52] Gerard Donnelly: Good.
[01:30:53] Gerard Donnelly: Thing is, he's improving.
[01:30:55] Gerard Donnelly: Yeah.
[01:30:56] Abby Jorgensen: Even his run is improving slowly.
[01:30:58] Gerard Donnelly: Just Abby, like when he did the July one at one.
[01:31:02] Gerard Donnelly: 177.
[01:31:04] Gerard Donnelly: He started this week at 154.
[01:31:07] Gerard Donnelly: Okay.
[01:31:09] Gerard Donnelly: It's too low, especially when he's done 177.
[01:31:14] Gerard Donnelly: he did that.
[01:31:15] Abby Jorgensen: The other one was on his gravel bike, so we didn't know.
[01:31:19] Gerard Donnelly: were, I told him to speak conservative, and then we'll go from there.
[01:31:23] Gerard Donnelly: That's That's the answer.
[01:31:24] Gerard Donnelly: Great.
[01:31:26] Gerard Donnelly: Okay.
[01:31:28] Gerard Donnelly: And he did 5K.
[01:31:30] Gerard Donnelly: Yep.
[01:31:39] Gerard Donnelly: He's fast as 5K.
[01:31:42] Gerard Donnelly: 32 minutes.
[01:31:44] Gerard Donnelly: Very good.
[01:31:52] Gerard Donnelly: Is that his first run with us, was it?
[01:31:54] Gerard Donnelly: Yeah.
[01:31:54] Gerard Donnelly: Almost 40 seconds faster.
[01:31:56] Abby Jorgensen: Very good.
[01:31:59] Gerard Donnelly: Hmm.
[01:32:01] Gerard Donnelly: Okay.
[01:32:02] Gerard Donnelly: You
[01:32:04] Gerard Donnelly: It looks like he's a bit too conservative.
[01:32:08] Abby Jorgensen: I don't think he trusts his running.
[01:32:10] Abby Jorgensen: I think we just need to add in some faster running for him.
[01:32:14] Abby Jorgensen: I just don't know when to start that.
[01:32:17] Gerard Donnelly: He hasn't done a lot of running, has he?
[01:32:19] Gerard Donnelly: Uh-uh.
[01:32:20] Gerard Donnelly: So, no, we don't do any faster running yet.
[01:32:22] Gerard Donnelly: But just telling when he does these, you know, he can start faster.
[01:32:26] Gerard Donnelly: Because look, he did 637 pace, and then he does 616.
[01:32:30] Gerard Donnelly: And his last, you know, his last section was 6 minutes.
[01:32:35] Gerard Donnelly: So, you know, telling me to back himself a bit more.
[01:32:42] Gerard Donnelly: So he should be starting at 6, you know, 625 pace next time, not 637.
[01:32:50] Gerard Donnelly: Okay?
[01:32:50] Gerard Donnelly: Okay.
[01:32:52] Abby Jorgensen: What's his race again?
[01:32:54] Abby Jorgensen: Ironman, Texas, and April.
[01:32:57] Abby Jorgensen: April, yeah, great.
[01:32:58] Gerard Donnelly: So just bring him slowly.
[01:33:00] Abby Jorgensen: Yeah, there's a gravel There's There's race in in in September.
[01:33:02] Abby Jorgensen: September.
[01:33:02] Abby Jorgensen: There's you.
[01:33:02] Abby Jorgensen: Yep, that's fine.
[01:33:05] Gerard Donnelly: So you've given him 40-20s and strength efforts?
[01:33:10] Gerard Donnelly: Yep, great.
[01:33:11] Gerard Donnelly: And is he coping with all that?
[01:33:14] Gerard Donnelly: Yep.
[01:33:14] Abby Jorgensen: Yeah, his last like 40-20s were like way above the...
[01:33:18] Abby Jorgensen: Yes, okay.
[01:33:20] Gerard Donnelly: So just remind him to make sure he's adjusting all his settings correctly and you check them.
[01:33:25] Gerard Donnelly: Yep.
[01:33:26] Gerard Donnelly: Okay.
[01:33:26] Gerard Donnelly: And that's good.
[01:33:28] Gerard Donnelly: The five-minute, keep going with them.
[01:33:29] Gerard Donnelly: And the 30-15s, that's great.
[01:33:31] Gerard Donnelly: So do three weeks of that.
[01:33:32] Gerard Donnelly: That's fine.
[01:33:33] Gerard Donnelly: Okay.
[01:33:34] Gerard Donnelly: That's really good.
[01:33:36] Gerard Donnelly: Are happy?
[01:33:37] Gerard Donnelly: Yeah, he...
[01:33:38] Abby Jorgensen: Yeah, I talk to him a few times a week.
[01:33:41] Abby Jorgensen: He's always communicating really well, so...
[01:33:43] Gerard Donnelly: Fantastic.
[01:33:44] Gerard Donnelly: Okay.
[01:33:45] Gerard Donnelly: Well, Peter, we don't need to talk about.
[01:33:47] Gerard Donnelly: Kristen?
[01:33:47] Gerard Donnelly: Kristen?
[01:33:48] Gerard Donnelly: Yeah, she's another wild card.
[01:33:51] Abby Jorgensen: Yeah, she has like a 600-mile Japan race in September.
[01:33:56] Abby Jorgensen: 600?
[01:33:57] Gerard Donnelly: I don't know.
[01:33:59] Abby Jorgensen: It's freaking crazy, but she just is, you know...
[01:34:03] Abby Jorgensen: You know how as soon as that 70.3 got done, she was like, I don't want to schedule, but I want to run and swim, but I just want to bike.
[01:34:12] Abby Jorgensen: And then I was like, OK.
[01:34:14] Abby Jorgensen: And then, like, I talked to her today and she's just been really happy riding.
[01:34:19] Abby Jorgensen: And she's like, as soon as this race is over, I promise I'll get back to more of a schedule.
[01:34:25] Gerard Donnelly: And I'm just trying to help her as much as I can.
[01:34:29] Gerard Donnelly: And remember the same theory.
[01:34:30] Gerard Donnelly: Give her one intensity day.
[01:34:32] Gerard Donnelly: OK.
[01:34:34] Gerard Donnelly: It's great for her to go riding aerobically, but she still needs one.
[01:34:38] Gerard Donnelly: And tell her the reasons why.
[01:34:39] Gerard Donnelly: You will be a better bike rider.
[01:34:41] Gerard Donnelly: All of the science testing over all the subjects that they've done over the years is people who do just long training are not as fit as people who do long training with one session with intensity.
[01:34:57] Gerard Donnelly: You will be a better bike rider.
[01:34:59] Gerard Donnelly: That's actually what she wants to hear.
[01:35:01] Gerard Donnelly: You walk on it.
[01:35:03] Gerard Donnelly: We'll improve with one high intensity.
[01:35:09] Gerard Donnelly: Okay, Dan?
[01:35:12] Gerard Donnelly: Dan, it's doing good.
[01:35:15] Gerard Donnelly: What's next for him?
[01:35:18] Abby Jorgensen: That one there, and then he has a 70, like a non-sanctioned Ironman 70.3.
[01:35:25] Abby Jorgensen: Yeah, great.
[01:35:27] Abby Jorgensen: Fantastic.
[01:35:28] Abby Jorgensen: Where does he live?
[01:35:29] Gerard Donnelly: Texas.
[01:35:30] Gerard Donnelly: Texas, yeah, okay.
[01:35:33] Gerard Donnelly: Is he following the program and on board?
[01:35:37] Gerard Donnelly: Yep.
[01:35:38] Abby Jorgensen: Yeah, he's doing good.
[01:35:39] Abby Jorgensen: We adjust.
[01:35:40] Abby Jorgensen: Like, he gets in his head a lot about his running because he was a good runner to start with.
[01:35:45] Abby Jorgensen: Yep.
[01:35:46] Abby Jorgensen: And with the heat, too, I keep telling him, like, it's okay.
[01:35:49] Abby Jorgensen: Like, he's not going to be as fast as he were.
[01:35:53] Gerard Donnelly: Yep.
[01:35:54] Gerard Donnelly: Just be careful with the – if you feel like he's coping, you know, doing the 1K intervals, I don't give that to anybody but our pro guides.
[01:36:02] Gerard Donnelly: Thanks.
[01:36:03] Gerard Donnelly: You know, so be super careful giving him that, because that could end up with, you know.
[01:36:13] Gerard Donnelly: He's been coping well with it, so I didn't know.
[01:36:16] Gerard Donnelly: Yep.
[01:36:17] Gerard Donnelly: So remember, Abby, we've got, we've got VO2 in our bike.
[01:36:21] Gerard Donnelly: So if we add a VO2 as a runner, you know, that's really a lot of load on them.
[01:36:28] Gerard Donnelly: And the pros who we coach can handle it, because they've been running for, you know, they're all 32, 33 minute, 10K runners.
[01:36:35] Gerard Donnelly: I don't think he is.
[01:36:38] Gerard Donnelly: I think he's a reasonable runner, isn't Yeah, he's a reasonable runner, like.
[01:36:47] Gerard Donnelly: Oh yeah, he's better than I thought.
[01:36:50] Gerard Donnelly: Yeah.
[01:36:53] Gerard Donnelly: Yep, that's good.
[01:36:54] Gerard Donnelly: He's in that category, that's fine.
[01:36:56] Gerard Donnelly: Yeah.
[01:36:58] Gerard Donnelly: 253 marathon, yep, that's okay.
[01:37:01] Gerard Donnelly: But he can still benefit.
[01:37:03] Gerard Donnelly: from less aggressive that's all okay we just don't want to injure him he seems like he's coping yeah and i've adjusted him a little bit here and there yeah okay just to ask him how is he pulling up sore if he is then it's too much okay that's great week three of the block then you'll test him again great Nancy in Hawaii yep um any any progress with discussions about what we're talking about last week um with her writing yeah i mean i she was like yeah Gerard's right i need to less freewheeling yeah things like that um um
[01:38:04] Abby Jorgensen: I think she just gets caught up too much, too, like overthinks things a little bit.
[01:38:12] Gerard Donnelly: She's running okay, but she's faded a little bit.
[01:38:14] Abby Jorgensen: Yeah, it got hot, she said, right towards the end.
[01:38:22] Gerard Donnelly: Why'd she start at 2 o'clock in the afternoon?
[01:38:26] Abby Jorgensen: Is she trying to simulate the race condition?
[01:38:29] Abby Jorgensen: Probably, knowing her.
[01:38:31] Abby Jorgensen: Yeah, tell her, don't do that in training.
[01:38:36] Gerard Donnelly: She missed, oh, she hasn't done today.
[01:38:38] Gerard Donnelly: She still did.
[01:38:39] Gerard Donnelly: Yeah, she's still, it's still, I was going to say, why is that red?
[01:38:45] Gerard Donnelly: It's already red for me.
[01:38:47] Gerard Donnelly: It's really hard for us in Australia when we're coaching because, oh, did I miss?
[01:38:52] Gerard Donnelly: I think, oh, no, no, it's not even Saturday.
[01:38:56] Gerard Donnelly: It's the opposite for me.
[01:38:57] Abby Jorgensen: I'm like, why haven't they done their session yet?
[01:39:01] Abby Jorgensen: Yeah, it's so weird.
[01:39:03] Gerard Donnelly: So how does she go with the – did she do more pressure on the pedals?
[01:39:07] Gerard Donnelly: That's the key.
[01:39:11] Gerard Donnelly: A lot of freewheeling still.
[01:39:13] Abby Jorgensen: Yeah, I don't know how – like, how steep are those hills?
[01:39:16] Abby Jorgensen: She keeps being like they're steep.
[01:39:18] Gerard Donnelly: They're not steep.
[01:39:19] Gerard Donnelly: She's just kidding herself.
[01:39:20] Gerard Donnelly: Yeah.
[01:39:21] Abby Jorgensen: They're just not steep.
[01:39:23] Gerard Donnelly: They're rolling hills, right?
[01:39:28] Gerard Donnelly: That's the Harvey Hill.
[01:39:32] Gerard Donnelly: it's 2% to 3%.
[01:39:34] Gerard Donnelly: You know, it's not 8%.
[01:39:40] Gerard Donnelly: Her cadence is good.
[01:39:42] Gerard Donnelly: Yeah.
[01:39:43] Abby Jorgensen: We worked a lot on that.
[01:39:45] Abby Jorgensen: It was little.
[01:39:47] Gerard Donnelly: She just stops pedaling so much.
[01:39:49] Gerard Donnelly: She's still doing it.
[01:39:53] Gerard Donnelly: You know the sound?
[01:39:55] Gerard Donnelly: You know when you stop pedaling the sound your bike makes?
[01:39:58] Gerard Donnelly: Yeah, mine doesn't make that, but yeah, I know.
[01:40:01] Gerard Donnelly: If I'm in a bunch with people and I
[01:40:04] Gerard Donnelly: If I hear someone doing that, straight away I'm yelling out, keep pedaling, you know, you must keep pedaling, unless you're doing 40 miles an hour, and you can't pedal, so she's still spiking, like 200, 190, 170, 180, she's 200, look, she spikes and stops, 25 watts, how can you go from 176 to 25, it's just ridiculous, just, you know, use your gears, and keep, she's doing better here, but that's, you she can do it, look at that, she can do it, pressure on the pedals, but the minute the gradient changes, she's lost, 48, you know, that's the thing I'd be showing her in a Loom video, you know, stop this, stop this stuff, you know, if you have to do that, it means you're riding too hard here.
[01:41:03] Gerard Donnelly: The only reason you would stop pedaling is because you gassed.
[01:41:07] Gerard Donnelly: Why else would you stop pedaling?
[01:41:10] Gerard Donnelly: The brain has to understand that every time you stop pedaling, you slow down.
[01:41:15] Gerard Donnelly: You want to contribute to forward momentum the whole time.
[01:41:19] Gerard Donnelly: And in the race, they're the things I would be telling you.
[01:41:22] Gerard Donnelly: We're practicing for what's going to happen in the race.
[01:41:24] Gerard Donnelly: If you don't keep pedaling, your heart rate, if I don't understand that, if we stripped away everything, look what her heart rate does, Abby.
[01:41:39] Gerard Donnelly: It's just up and down.
[01:41:40] Gerard Donnelly: And if I put power back beside it, it's her, you know, your heart rate shouldn't be jumping like this.
[01:41:48] Gerard Donnelly: It shouldn't go from 120 to 102.
[01:41:53] Gerard Donnelly: That's you recovering all the time.
[01:41:56] Gerard Donnelly: You know, the heart rate should be steady state, like here.
[01:42:00] Gerard Donnelly: And, you know, if we put the power back on there, bet you she's, she's.
[01:42:03] Gerard Donnelly: Got the pressure on the pedals there.
[01:42:04] Gerard Donnelly: bet you.
[01:42:10] Gerard Donnelly: There it is.
[01:42:11] Gerard Donnelly: There's no dips there.
[01:42:12] Gerard Donnelly: See that?
[01:42:14] Gerard Donnelly: There's no dips.
[01:42:14] Gerard Donnelly: The minute she dips, the heart rate drops to 108.
[01:42:19] Gerard Donnelly: You know, the heart rate over here is 120.
[01:42:22] Gerard Donnelly: The heart rate here is 107.
[01:42:24] Gerard Donnelly: Because she stops pedaling.
[01:42:26] Gerard Donnelly: So that's what you're trying to get her to keep that heart rate steady and keep the power steady.
[01:42:33] Gerard Donnelly: They go together.
[01:42:34] Gerard Donnelly: And so does the cadence.
[01:42:44] Gerard Donnelly: So there's lots of times she's in the 70s and lots of times she's in the 90s, high 80s.
[01:42:52] Gerard Donnelly: That's a hard thing to do is to go 90, 70.
[01:42:55] Gerard Donnelly: It means you're not changing ears enough.
[01:42:59] Gerard Donnelly: So yeah, just keep pushing her on that.
[01:43:03] Gerard Donnelly: Thank
[01:43:03] Gerard Donnelly: I think that's her biggest training thing that she needs to get better at.
[01:43:08] Gerard Donnelly: She actually tells her, Gerard's really happy with the training you're doing, the volume you're doing, the efforts you're making, but you're not going to improve unless you keep training with more pressure on the pedals.
[01:43:21] Gerard Donnelly: And if you need to drop the power down so that you don't have to recover, do that, but just keep pedaling.
[01:43:28] Gerard Donnelly: Again, there's too many times when you're stopped pedaling or soft pedaling.
[01:43:37] Abby Jorgensen: Okay?
[01:43:38] Gerard Donnelly: Okay.
[01:43:51] Gerard Donnelly: Just be careful.
[01:43:52] Gerard Donnelly: She's not, as I said to last week, she's not doing too many, you know, there's a lot of long, slow stuff here, but...
[01:44:02] Gerard Donnelly: And she's got that wrong.
[01:44:03] Gerard Donnelly: She's got that ride there, that's a four and a half hour ride, and then she's got three and a half hours, and then she's got seven hours.
[01:44:13] Gerard Donnelly: So, yeah, just be careful that's not too much, Abby.
[01:44:18] Gerard Donnelly: Okay.
[01:44:22] Gerard Donnelly: And her running, she'll add another run there, so that's okay.
[01:44:38] Gerard Donnelly: She's got one long run there, and a long run there, so I'd probably get her to run a little bit longer there.
[01:44:51] Gerard Donnelly: Okay.
[01:44:52] Gerard Donnelly: And maybe, when's her last run?
[01:44:56] Gerard Donnelly: Here and there.
[01:44:58] Gerard Donnelly: I'd be making this run a little bit longer, and this ride less.
[01:45:03] Gerard Donnelly: wait, or
[01:45:03] Gerard Donnelly: Okay.
[01:45:05] Gerard Donnelly: So drop that down to two hours and move this run up to one hour.
[01:45:19] Gerard Donnelly: And that way she can ride a little bit harder with pressure on the pedals.
[01:45:24] Gerard Donnelly: All right?
[01:45:26] Gerard Donnelly: Yep.
[01:45:29] Gerard Donnelly: Anything else on her?
[01:45:31] Abby Jorgensen: No.
[01:45:33] Abby Jorgensen: We're good there.
[01:45:35] Gerard Donnelly: Where's Bill going?
[01:45:37] Gerard Donnelly: He's good besides the hurricane.
[01:45:40] Gerard Donnelly: Yeah.
[01:45:42] Abby Jorgensen: And he's had some foot pain, so we've had to cut back the running this past week and a half.
[01:45:51] Gerard Donnelly: You're getting that looked at, or is it minor?
[01:45:56] Gerard Donnelly: Yeah, he thinks it's minor, but he just doesn't want to do anything this close.
[01:46:01] Abby Jorgensen: So we're trying to.
[01:46:03] Abby Jorgensen: I'm trying to watch it this last week.
[01:46:06] Abby Jorgensen: We started last week a little bit, and then this week we're going to – he said the swelling and everything has gone down, so he just wants to be careful.
[01:46:15] Gerard Donnelly: Is it antifasciatus or is it – He says it's the top of the foot that hurts.
[01:46:21] Gerard Donnelly: Top?
[01:46:22] Gerard Donnelly: Yeah.
[01:46:22] Abby Jorgensen: That's why he doesn't know what it – because he's had antifasciatus before, and he says it's not that.
[01:46:28] Abby Jorgensen: Is his shoes too tight on top?
[01:46:30] Gerard Donnelly: His laces too tight?
[01:46:31] Gerard Donnelly: I don't know.
[01:46:32] Gerard Donnelly: I know that, yeah.
[01:46:34] Gerard Donnelly: Ask him.
[01:46:34] Gerard Donnelly: A lot of the guys buy shoes that are too tight, and there's not enough movement in their foot, so it's pressure on the top of their foot.
[01:46:47] Gerard Donnelly: He might need to see a podiatrist.
[01:46:49] Gerard Donnelly: I don't know.
[01:46:50] Abby Jorgensen: Yeah, I've told him, and, you know, he's hesitant because he doesn't want bad news, but I was like, if it's getting better, it's probably it's fine, but you need to probably see somebody.
[01:47:00] Gerard Donnelly: Yeah, but it's coming.
[01:47:02] Gerard Donnelly: It's coming.
[01:47:02] Gerard Donnelly: coming.
[01:47:02] Gerard Donnelly: coming.
[01:47:02] Gerard Donnelly: It's coming.
[01:47:03] Gerard Donnelly: As an injury for a reason, you're better off finding out what the reason is, so you don't actually go back to what you were doing again and it comes back.
[01:47:11] Gerard Donnelly: That would be my logic.
[01:47:19] Gerard Donnelly: And his bike, his TT bike is in the shop, something broke on it.
[01:47:24] Abby Jorgensen: So he's been on a road bike on his trainer because he can't really go outside with Hurricane.
[01:47:29] Abby Jorgensen: Yeah, so he's done four hours.
[01:47:32] Gerard Donnelly: So really push him to get his TT bike back as soon as possible.
[01:47:35] Gerard Donnelly: He can't even train for an Ironman when he's...
[01:47:37] Gerard Donnelly: Yeah, it should be back, he said, by Tuesday, Wednesday.
[01:47:40] Gerard Donnelly: Yeah, okay.
[01:47:41] Abby Jorgensen: Hopefully.
[01:47:42] Abby Jorgensen: Yeah.
[01:47:47] Abby Jorgensen: I'm just waiting to hear his foot before I decide on the runs for next week.
[01:47:51] Gerard Donnelly: Yeah.
[01:47:53] Gerard Donnelly: If you're worried about his running, don't have three in a row.
[01:48:00] Gerard Donnelly: Yeah, just have...
[01:48:02] Gerard Donnelly: Just have a break in between...
[01:48:03] Gerard Donnelly: Yeah.
[01:48:05] Gerard Donnelly: Two in a row is okay, but three in a row, especially when someone's injured.
[01:48:11] Gerard Donnelly: So I'd push him out for a longer ride on the Wednesday, and maybe, if you think he's going to run there, push him out for a longer run there, but take that run away, Gerard Donnelly.
[01:48:33] Gerard Donnelly: I have to go, I think.
[01:48:34] Gerard Donnelly: Okay.
[01:48:36] Gerard Donnelly: Oh, no, it's okay.
[01:48:37] Gerard Donnelly: He's hung up.
[01:48:40] Gerard Donnelly: Yeah, just monitor that running.
[01:48:43] Gerard Donnelly: We don't want to jump him straight back into running if he's, you know, three in row is probably too much.
[01:48:49] Gerard Donnelly: Yeah.
[01:48:51] Abby Jorgensen: I'll just, yeah, I'll text him too.
[01:48:54] Abby Jorgensen: I talked to him earlier today about his ride, but.
[01:48:57] Gerard Donnelly: Yeah.
[01:48:58] Gerard Donnelly: Do you have a switch feeling?
[01:49:00] Abby Jorgensen: So, longer ride here.
[01:49:02] Gerard Donnelly: Okay.
[01:49:03] Abby Jorgensen: Okay.
[01:49:09] Gerard Donnelly: All right.
[01:49:10] Gerard Donnelly: Yep.
[01:49:11] Gerard Donnelly: Anything else?
[01:49:13] Gerard Donnelly: No.
[01:49:16] Abby Jorgensen: Okay.
[01:49:16] Gerard Donnelly: Good luck tomorrow with you.
[01:49:18] Gerard Donnelly: Thanks.
[01:49:20] Abby Jorgensen: And look forward to seeing you.
[01:49:21] Gerard Donnelly: That'll be good.
[01:49:23] Gerard Donnelly: Yeah.
[01:49:23] Gerard Donnelly: Looking forward to seeing how you go.
[01:49:26] Gerard Donnelly: All right.
[01:49:28] Abby Jorgensen: All right.
[01:49:29] Abby Jorgensen: Well, good luck with you, sir.
[01:49:30] Gerard Donnelly: Yeah.
[01:49:31] Gerard Donnelly: It's been moved to Friday.
[01:49:32] Gerard Donnelly: So, it's good that we got this done.
[01:49:40] Gerard Donnelly: Yeah.
[01:49:42] Abby Jorgensen: When do you think we'll meet again?
[01:49:45] Abby Jorgensen: you?
[01:49:46] Abby Jorgensen: I'll be right next Monday for Sunday night for you.
[01:49:49] Gerard Donnelly: Sunday night.
[01:49:50] Gerard Donnelly: So exactly what we did today, except you're doing it Saturday night and I'm doing it Sunday morning.
[01:49:55] Gerard Donnelly: Let's push your Sunday night, my Monday morning.
[01:49:58] Gerard Donnelly: Okay?
[01:49:59] Gerard Donnelly: Okay.
[01:50:00] Gerard Donnelly: Is right?
[01:50:01] Gerard Donnelly: That should work.
[01:50:02] Gerard Donnelly: Yeah.
[01:50:02] Gerard Donnelly: I'll be right Sunday.
[01:50:03] Gerard Donnelly: next Sunday.
[01:50:03] Gerard Donnelly: Yeah.
[01:50:04] Gerard Donnelly: Sunday night for you.
[01:50:05] Abby Jorgensen: I won't have, I'm not going to, I don't have a long weekend again, do I?
[01:50:09] Abby Jorgensen: No, you don't.
[01:50:10] Gerard Donnelly: No, you have a 60 minute app.
[01:50:12] Gerard Donnelly: Okay.
[01:50:12] Gerard Donnelly: And then Sunday's easy.
[01:50:14] Gerard Donnelly: So you'll be fresh as a daisy.
[01:50:17] Abby Jorgensen: I won't know what to do with my, all my time that I have.
[01:50:21] Abby Jorgensen: I actually think I'm going to, my friends own the doggy daycare that my dog goes to.
[01:50:26] Abby Jorgensen: So they're going to give me some hours of work.
[01:50:30] Abby Jorgensen: Oh, fantastic.
[01:50:32] Gerard Donnelly: You love dogs anyway.
[01:50:33] Gerard Donnelly: So.
[01:50:33] Gerard Donnelly: Yeah.
[01:50:33] Abby Jorgensen: I was like, it's going to be a nice change of pace.
[01:50:35] Abby Jorgensen: So I'm going to take a few weeks off, obviously in September after the Ironman and then go play with dogs all day.
[01:50:43] Abby Jorgensen: Yeah, no, that's good.
[01:50:44] Gerard Donnelly: Very good.
[01:50:44] Abby Jorgensen: It was a little stressful for this last couple of weeks of trying to figure out things, but hopefully.
[01:50:51] Gerard Donnelly: Yeah, that's great.
[01:50:52] Gerard Donnelly: And I've got an interview.
[01:50:53] Gerard Donnelly: I've just got an application this morning from someone in the States, in the U.S.
[01:50:57] Gerard Donnelly: So they wanted to Ironman, do an Ironman.
[01:51:01] Gerard Donnelly: Who was it?
[01:51:05] Gerard Donnelly: David Flippo, his area code is 540, 540, I wonder what that is, 540.
[01:51:18] Gerard Donnelly: It doesn't sound familiar.
[01:51:22] Gerard Donnelly: Ironman in 13 months' time.
[01:51:24] Gerard Donnelly: That's plenty of time.
[01:51:26] Gerard Donnelly: I'm looking to get coaching for an Ironman in 13 months' time, give or take a few weeks either way.
[01:51:31] Gerard Donnelly: Currently ran a one-hour, 47.5 in May.
[01:51:34] Gerard Donnelly: Completed a 50K Ultra, six hours.
[01:51:39] Gerard Donnelly: Biking experience is from Peloton.
[01:51:41] Gerard Donnelly: I recently got a Felt Z85 to train with.
[01:51:45] Gerard Donnelly: I have a pool and access to an Olympic-sized pool.
[01:51:49] Gerard Donnelly: I need to ask on the base I work at.
[01:51:54] Gerard Donnelly: Virginia, you must be military.
[01:51:57] Abby Jorgensen: At your base, on the base.
[01:51:58] Gerard Donnelly: Oh, you've picked that up well.
[01:52:02] Abby Jorgensen: Yeah.
[01:52:03] Abby Jorgensen: I've with two military guys, I didn't know that well.
[01:52:06] Abby Jorgensen: Yeah.
[01:52:08] Gerard Donnelly: Good.
[01:52:11] Gerard Donnelly: Sorry for all the information, just wanted to give you a little bit about me before meeting.
[01:52:15] Gerard Donnelly: Great.
[01:52:17] Abby Jorgensen: We want information.
[01:52:18] Gerard Donnelly: That's exactly what you want, David.
[01:52:21] Gerard Donnelly: All right, let's see how we go with him.
[01:52:23] Gerard Donnelly: So really, everybody who applies, I'm going to push towards you.
[01:52:30] Gerard Donnelly: So I'll get your numbers up.
[01:52:33] Gerard Donnelly: All right, sounds good.
[01:52:34] Abby Jorgensen: Well, good luck.
[01:52:36] Gerard Donnelly: Thanks, Abby.
[01:52:37] Gerard Donnelly: Yep.
[01:52:38] Gerard Donnelly: Have a good day tomorrow.
[01:52:39] Gerard Donnelly: See ya.
[01:52:39] Gerard Donnelly: Bye.
