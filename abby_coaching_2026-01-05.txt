## Transcript

[00:00:01] Gerard Donnelly: Tomorrow, it's going to be 110 here.
[00:00:04] Abby Jorgensen: Oh, I just looked and it was like 60-something there.
[00:00:08] Abby Jorgensen: Is right?
[00:00:11] Gerard Donnelly: Beautiful mornings, but what?
[00:00:13] Gerard Donnelly: In the afternoon.
[00:00:14] Abby Jorgensen: I mean, I don't know what I'd...
[00:00:16] Abby Jorgensen: I would take 70s.
[00:00:18] Abby Jorgensen: I like that middle range.
[00:00:20] Abby Jorgensen: Yeah, yeah.
[00:00:22] Gerard Donnelly: How's your week going?
[00:00:25] Abby Jorgensen: Good.
[00:00:26] Abby Jorgensen: No, I feel actually pretty good, considering.
[00:00:30] Abby Jorgensen: Third week, yep.
[00:00:31] Gerard Donnelly: Yeah.
[00:00:33] Gerard Donnelly: I was just looking at your heart rate for those six-minute efforts.
[00:00:39] Gerard Donnelly: So I was getting into the 170s, and I was having a look at what you did last week.
[00:00:49] Gerard Donnelly: Did you feel comfortable with that?
[00:00:51] Abby Jorgensen: Yeah, I think I even had it like 0.1 higher on the treadmill.
[00:00:58] Abby Jorgensen: Yes, okay.
[00:00:58] Abby Jorgensen: Yeah, point.
[00:00:59] Abby Jorgensen: Point.
[00:00:59] Abby Jorgensen: You
[00:00:59] Abby Jorgensen: Like, I tried to stay between, like, 8.1 and 8.2 this week, and last week I think I stayed around 8, so just kind of pushed it just a little bit more.
[00:01:10] Abby Jorgensen: That's really good.
[00:01:13] Abby Jorgensen: Yeah, I mean, I feel like I could probably go longer, too.
[00:01:16] Abby Jorgensen: Like, when I'm done with the six minutes, I'm glad to be done, but I'm also, like, I probably could have gone another minute.
[00:01:21] Abby Jorgensen: Good.
[00:01:23] Gerard Donnelly: So, that's great.
[00:01:24] Gerard Donnelly: You found a race.
[00:01:26] Gerard Donnelly: Yeah, I was like, oh, I've never heard of that one before.
[00:01:28] Abby Jorgensen: It's just in a little suburb outside of Des Moines, so.
[00:01:32] Abby Jorgensen: Fantastic.
[00:01:33] Gerard Donnelly: I I hope the weather's okay for you.
[00:01:35] Abby Jorgensen: Yeah, I mean, it's supposed to be, like, 30s, so we'll see.
[00:01:39] Abby Jorgensen: Hopefully the morning isn't too cold, but.
[00:01:42] Abby Jorgensen: Yeah.
[00:01:43] Abby Jorgensen: Oh, well.
[00:01:44] Gerard Donnelly: Do you get much rain during this period?
[00:01:47] Abby Jorgensen: It would be more snow if we get anything.
[00:01:50] Abby Jorgensen: Yeah.
[00:01:51] Abby Jorgensen: So.
[00:01:53] Gerard Donnelly: Well, the option is, if you don't get to do that, just jump on the treadmill.
[00:01:56] Abby Jorgensen: Yeah, we should, right now, looking at it.
[00:02:00] Abby Jorgensen: I should be, there might be some snow chances on Friday, but Sunday looks fine right now.
[00:02:07] Abby Jorgensen: Yeah, good.
[00:02:08] Gerard Donnelly: So you'd be happy for a little bit of a recovery week?
[00:02:12] Gerard Donnelly: Does it feel like that you need it?
[00:02:15] Gerard Donnelly: Yeah, for the most part.
[00:02:17] Abby Jorgensen: I'm ready, especially after those long runs on Sunday.
[00:02:20] Abby Jorgensen: Yeah, yeah.
[00:02:22] Gerard Donnelly: That's great, Abby, 70 Ks.
[00:02:25] Gerard Donnelly: I don't know what it is in miles, 50 miles or something, is it?
[00:02:27] Gerard Donnelly: Yeah, 45.
[00:02:29] Gerard Donnelly: So, you know, a couple of weeks of, or three weeks of, you know, anywhere between 60 and 70 is really good.
[00:02:38] Gerard Donnelly: So, yeah.
[00:02:41] Gerard Donnelly: Yeah, you got through the 60, 60, 60s, all right.
[00:02:45] Gerard Donnelly: Your power and your cadence is really good.
[00:02:49] Gerard Donnelly: As you said, your heart rate wasn't getting that much, but could be just managing it better.
[00:02:55] Gerard Donnelly: Yeah.
[00:02:58] Gerard Donnelly: And, yeah, those last four minutes.
[00:03:00] Gerard Donnelly: Efforts are crazy, aren't they?
[00:03:02] Gerard Donnelly: How about that last one?
[00:03:04] Abby Jorgensen: I think I was just mentally done.
[00:03:05] Abby Jorgensen: Because I did the run first early in the morning.
[00:03:08] Abby Jorgensen: Yes.
[00:03:09] Abby Jorgensen: Then I had to coach a class and then came back and did that.
[00:03:14] Abby Jorgensen: That's a great training day.
[00:03:17] Gerard Donnelly: Well done.
[00:03:18] Gerard Donnelly: That's really good.
[00:03:20] Gerard Donnelly: Because it's the new year, you're getting all these PBs, which is not true.
[00:03:24] Gerard Donnelly: Oh, that's what I was wondering for.
[00:03:26] Gerard Donnelly: They recalibrate for the new year, which I don't know why they did it.
[00:03:29] Gerard Donnelly: But anyway, so you're right this week then?
[00:03:34] Abby Jorgensen: Yep.
[00:03:34] Abby Jorgensen: Yep.
[00:03:37] Abby Jorgensen: I'll probably try to maintain my FTP.
[00:03:40] Abby Jorgensen: What do you think I should start here?
[00:03:42] Abby Jorgensen: Yeah, yeah.
[00:03:44] Gerard Donnelly: That's what we're trying to do here.
[00:03:47] Gerard Donnelly: Just have that mindset of I'm going to be more conservative.
[00:03:52] Gerard Donnelly: And it'll be a much, you know, a much more enjoyable.
[00:03:57] Gerard Donnelly: trying tell you.
[00:03:58] Gerard Donnelly: Um.
[00:03:59] Gerard Donnelly: Just hang What okay.
[00:04:00] Gerard Donnelly: Effort.
[00:04:00] Gerard Donnelly: mean, I think you're 193 in the last two months.
[00:04:04] Gerard Donnelly: So, yeah, just start around that.
[00:04:10] Gerard Donnelly: I-180.
[00:04:11] Abby Jorgensen: I-180 again.
[00:04:14] Gerard Donnelly: And see how you go.
[00:04:15] Gerard Donnelly: You did finish at 206 last time, so you did have a little bit more in the tank at the end.
[00:04:21] Gerard Donnelly: So, yeah, no stress on that one.
[00:04:24] Gerard Donnelly: It's really just a good training session with concentrating on executing.
[00:04:34] Gerard Donnelly: All right, let's get into it, eh?
[00:04:36] Gerard Donnelly: Yeah.
[00:04:37] Abby Jorgensen: Got a nice postcard from Coco.
[00:04:39] Gerard Donnelly: Yeah, I did too.
[00:04:41] Abby Jorgensen: I don't even know.
[00:04:42] Abby Jorgensen: I was like, where'd you get my address?
[00:04:44] Abby Jorgensen: I thought maybe she asked you.
[00:04:45] Abby Jorgensen: And she's like, I just Googled it.
[00:04:46] Abby Jorgensen: I was like, well, that's ballsy that you would just trust the Google.
[00:04:51] Abby Jorgensen: But it was right, apparently.
[00:04:53] Abby Jorgensen: I was like, it's also weird that my address is on Google, so.
[00:04:57] Abby Jorgensen: Me too.
[00:04:58] Gerard Donnelly: I don't know how anybody else.
[00:05:01] Gerard Donnelly: Maybe because I send a parcel out and I've got return sender with my address on it.
[00:05:07] Gerard Donnelly: would make, let me send any of the welcome parcels.
[00:05:14] Gerard Donnelly: Yeah, so how's she going?
[00:05:16] Gerard Donnelly: Good.
[00:05:17] Abby Jorgensen: There's been like a, I guess, not a hurricane, but a tropical storm on the island right now or weekend.
[00:05:26] Abby Jorgensen: Um, and then she had, she had some concerns of testing.
[00:05:31] Abby Jorgensen: Like she sent me all these long messages.
[00:05:33] Abby Jorgensen: Like she obviously trusts us, but she, I don't know what, why she's hesitant of testing this week.
[00:05:41] Abby Jorgensen: Yeah.
[00:05:42] Abby Jorgensen: Um, so I just wanted to talk through it.
[00:05:45] Abby Jorgensen: And I, I mean, I told her it was more about, you know, practicing execution and all this stuff, but she still had like pushback because it's so windy there and conditions are unpredictable right now.
[00:05:57] Abby Jorgensen: And she didn't want to be disappointed in her.
[00:06:00] Abby Jorgensen: And I'm like, it's not about that.
[00:06:02] Abby Jorgensen: Good answer.
[00:06:04] Abby Jorgensen: Yeah, so I just didn't know how to approach it further from there.
[00:06:11] Abby Jorgensen: Yep.
[00:06:11] Gerard Donnelly: One of the easiest things is, you know, have a discussion again with her saying, you know, Gerard and I met again.
[00:06:18] Gerard Donnelly: And it's really a crucial part of your program that we have a deload week when you've been training so hard.
[00:06:27] Gerard Donnelly: And in that deload week, we want to use it as an opportunity for a little bit of a mini taper into a high-intensity swim, bike, and run training session where you're really asking yourself to see how good you are at executing.
[00:06:48] Gerard Donnelly: And obviously, it's great feedback for us to get the number to train to.
[00:06:54] Gerard Donnelly: So that's, you know, it's really important.
[00:06:57] Gerard Donnelly: That we know we're training accurately.
[00:06:58] Gerard Donnelly: And if we don't test.
[00:06:59] Gerard Donnelly: And
[00:07:00] Gerard Donnelly: For three months, you could be training too easy and not know it, or you could be training too hard and put yourself into a hole.
[00:07:08] Gerard Donnelly: So, you know, that's the thing that you used to do before you joined us was just keep training for six months and never, never adjust to settings.
[00:07:17] Gerard Donnelly: So you're never, you're never training with overload.
[00:07:20] Gerard Donnelly: You're always training the same for six months.
[00:07:21] Gerard Donnelly: And that's why you're improving so much, you know.
[00:07:26] Gerard Donnelly: So it's, it's really important that you get to, you know, it's not, it's, it's not a failure.
[00:07:37] Gerard Donnelly: It's, it could be that we're not specifically doing much, you know, 20 minute sessions.
[00:07:46] Gerard Donnelly: You're doing a lot of endurance.
[00:07:48] Gerard Donnelly: So I would be saying the expectations should be different for these tests and the conditions you're going to have, you know, unless it's a freaking hurricane, like you said, you know.
[00:08:00] Gerard Donnelly: Move the session so that it suits the day with the weather.
[00:08:05] Gerard Donnelly: But if you feel she's – I'm happy to call her, Abby, just like I called – is it Peter?
[00:08:14] Gerard Donnelly: Yeah.
[00:08:17] Gerard Donnelly: Peter Mendez, yeah.
[00:08:22] Gerard Donnelly: So, yeah, don't hesitate.
[00:08:24] Gerard Donnelly: If you want me to jump in, I'm happy to.
[00:08:28] Abby Jorgensen: Yeah, I'll have another, like, kind of talk through what the week's forecast looks like.
[00:08:33] Abby Jorgensen: But, yeah, I don't mean – let me see.
[00:08:35] Abby Jorgensen: Like, I can kind of read some of – she's just – with the swim, she was more concerned, like, she's trying to fix things.
[00:08:44] Abby Jorgensen: But I was like, well, wouldn't you want to know if what you're fixing is working?
[00:08:48] Abby Jorgensen: Yeah.
[00:08:50] Abby Jorgensen: And then her concern is going into when she goes to the other island for that camp that she won't be able to train as – to up with her heart rate.
[00:08:59] Abby Jorgensen: you.
[00:09:00] Abby Jorgensen: As much or something, I don't, it didn't really make sense to me why that was.
[00:09:06] Abby Jorgensen: She's trying to push that I don't want to waste a week.
[00:09:08] Abby Jorgensen: Yeah.
[00:09:09] Gerard Donnelly: And so the answer is, you've got to trust the process.
[00:09:13] Gerard Donnelly: We need you to have a recovery period.
[00:09:15] Gerard Donnelly: And look, the sessions you've given her, you could, you know, you could have an easy ride on Tuesday and have an easy ride on Wednesday like you've got.
[00:09:25] Gerard Donnelly: So you can have a, you could add a Tuesday ride to it if you want to.
[00:09:31] Gerard Donnelly: You know, a zone two easy, just to give a little bit to her, you know, a 90-minute zone two or a 60 to 90-minute zone two, just an easy ride on.
[00:09:42] Gerard Donnelly: You've got an easy ride on Wednesday, that's fine.
[00:09:45] Gerard Donnelly: But, you know, you could give a, has she got any indoor facility?
[00:09:49] Gerard Donnelly: How is she training anyway if there's a hurricane?
[00:09:51] Gerard Donnelly: She did the treadmill yesterday.
[00:09:54] Abby Jorgensen: Yeah.
[00:09:56] Abby Jorgensen: I thought she wasn't going to get outside.
[00:09:58] Abby Jorgensen: I think she messaged me Saturday.
[00:10:00] Abby Jorgensen: And it was like, hey, but then I looked at our session and some of it was outside.
[00:10:04] Abby Jorgensen: So I don't know.
[00:10:06] Abby Jorgensen: Yeah, that one's inside.
[00:10:09] Gerard Donnelly: Was that a run with it, recovery?
[00:10:11] Gerard Donnelly: I don't know what that was.
[00:10:13] Abby Jorgensen: It just uploaded to the coaches.
[00:10:18] Abby Jorgensen: I mean, like looking at some of her like notes and like looking at her recovery and stuff, like she needs to, like, I think she knows she needs a recovery week, but she's like, she's going to waste.
[00:10:30] Abby Jorgensen: A whole week on an island where she can train unlimited, which I'm like, you've been training.
[00:10:36] Abby Jorgensen: I told her I was like, what was it, 24 hours or something like that?
[00:10:40] Abby Jorgensen: I'm like.
[00:10:41] Abby Jorgensen: Yeah.
[00:10:41] Abby Jorgensen: Yeah.
[00:10:42] Abby Jorgensen: 29.
[00:10:43] Abby Jorgensen: 29, if you count, like, all the strength and all the swimming and stuff she's doing.
[00:10:49] Abby Jorgensen: Yeah.
[00:10:49] Gerard Donnelly: And in a nice way, say to her, you know, I set myself up for failure without fueling.
[00:10:55] Gerard Donnelly: Well, don't do that.
[00:10:57] Gerard Donnelly: Yeah.
[00:10:57] Gerard Donnelly: Okay.
[00:10:58] Abby Jorgensen: That's.
[00:10:59] Abby Jorgensen: That's.
[00:10:59] Abby Jorgensen: That's.
[00:11:00] Gerard Donnelly: Irresponsible training.
[00:11:01] Gerard Donnelly: That's not how a professional trains.
[00:11:05] Gerard Donnelly: What are you doing that for?
[00:11:09] Gerard Donnelly: It's great that she tells you, but it's crazy that she's doing that.
[00:11:16] Abby Jorgensen: Yeah, she has unlimited access, it sounds like, to food there.
[00:11:23] Abby Jorgensen: Yeah.
[00:11:24] Abby Jorgensen: Going crazy.
[00:11:24] Abby Jorgensen: Yep.
[00:11:25] Gerard Donnelly: So, you know, I would give another for Tuesday.
[00:11:32] Gerard Donnelly: You know, Tex is saying, I've discussed with Gerard, you know, it's okay to do a Zone 2 ride on Tuesday.
[00:11:38] Gerard Donnelly: And, you know, you've got your ride on Tuesday as well.
[00:11:45] Gerard Donnelly: It's okay to add another swim on Wednesday, if you want.
[00:11:54] Gerard Donnelly: And if you look, normally, Abby, I would give a short, sharp session on the pre-FTP.
[00:11:59] Gerard Donnelly: Okay.
[00:12:01] Gerard Donnelly: Just to wake her legs up a bit, but a short one, know, like something like a 30-30, 30-30, where it's something like this one, where it's really short.
[00:12:19] Gerard Donnelly: If you wanted to, I'll just hide it for you.
[00:12:21] Gerard Donnelly: Okay.
[00:12:26] Gerard Donnelly: And the endurance.
[00:12:31] Gerard Donnelly: So don't hesitate to, you know, get me to jump in if you want.
[00:12:39] Abby Jorgensen: Yeah, I'll see what she says after I have another talk with her and she's still hesitant then.
[00:12:45] Abby Jorgensen: Yeah.
[00:12:49] Gerard Donnelly: So I would hide that one, the coffee ride, if you wanted.
[00:12:54] Gerard Donnelly: And she could extend this run to, you know, 40 minutes.
[00:12:59] Gerard Donnelly: And
[00:13:00] Gerard Donnelly: Do you want it?
[00:13:02] Gerard Donnelly: It's still easy.
[00:13:04] Gerard Donnelly: It's not meant to be hard.
[00:13:05] Abby Jorgensen: Yeah.
[00:13:10] Abby Jorgensen: Should I add any to the end of the 10K on Sunday?
[00:13:16] Gerard Donnelly: Yeah, give her that option that she can go.
[00:13:21] Gerard Donnelly: I would do recovery, walk.
[00:13:31] Gerard Donnelly: Duration, five minutes, walking, recovery walk, at walk pace, and then get her to run the cool down for 20 minutes.
[00:13:53] Gerard Donnelly: Okay?
[00:13:54] Gerard Donnelly: And that gives her an hour 20.
[00:13:56] Gerard Donnelly: Okay.
[00:13:58] Gerard Donnelly: Okay with that?
[00:13:59] Gerard Donnelly: And then it just...
[00:13:59] Gerard Donnelly: Oh.
[00:14:00] Gerard Donnelly: What I do is change that.
[00:14:06] Gerard Donnelly: She won't know if Fathom is anyway.
[00:14:11] Gerard Donnelly: I'll just make that 30.
[00:14:13] Gerard Donnelly: Okay.
[00:14:16] Abby Jorgensen: That might make her a little happier too.
[00:14:17] Abby Jorgensen: Because she was like, can we keep building in the long run?
[00:14:20] Abby Jorgensen: mean, well, the whole point of a deload is not to...
[00:14:23] Abby Jorgensen: Yeah, you've got to make that clear to her.
[00:14:25] Gerard Donnelly: The whole point of a deload is that we reduce the endurance.
[00:14:30] Gerard Donnelly: So that your body can recover.
[00:14:33] Gerard Donnelly: She's missing the concept of recovery allows for you to absorb the training load, which means you'll be a better athlete.
[00:14:42] Gerard Donnelly: So I think, you know, you have to really, in a nice way, get that message across.
[00:14:48] Gerard Donnelly: You could just give her another little run there, Abby.
[00:14:51] Gerard Donnelly: So that way she's still got four runs for the week.
[00:14:53] Gerard Donnelly: You know, 40, 40, 15, and now the volume's, you know, the volume is probably a little bit too down.
[00:15:02] Gerard Donnelly: But, you know, at least this way, she's getting something, you know, you're giving a little bit to her.
[00:15:10] Gerard Donnelly: And you should say, Gerard and I are absolutely frightened you'll train yourself into the ground if you don't follow our process, if you don't have this deload week.
[00:15:21] Gerard Donnelly: And, you know, when you're on the camp, you told us that you could go training after the sessions are finished.
[00:15:27] Abby Jorgensen: I mean, yeah, her sessions on top of, you know, a couple hours already of doing, like, Zone 2 is still a lot of work.
[00:15:34] Abby Jorgensen: That's right.
[00:15:35] Abby Jorgensen: Yeah.
[00:15:35] Abby Jorgensen: Still a of volume.
[00:15:38] Gerard Donnelly: Yeah.
[00:15:38] Gerard Donnelly: So, yeah, so she's right.
[00:15:44] Gerard Donnelly: She, you know, she's got the Ironman coming up.
[00:15:45] Gerard Donnelly: So we want to have one week where she's still riding, what'd she ride?
[00:15:52] Gerard Donnelly: 340K in Red 44.
[00:15:55] Gerard Donnelly: Yeah.
[00:15:56] Gerard Donnelly: That was a little bit smaller week.
[00:15:59] Gerard Donnelly: week.
[00:16:01] Gerard Donnelly: 3.29 and 4.7, 3.30 and 5.5, you know, they're a couple of good weeks.
[00:16:15] Gerard Donnelly: So this 60 minutes, you've got to really push her to make it 15 minutes out and back, not half an hour out and back.
[00:16:22] Gerard Donnelly: She's got to do four turns, okay?
[00:16:25] Gerard Donnelly: Okay.
[00:16:28] Gerard Donnelly: And if she wanted to and it too windy, she could do the other FTP indoor, but I don't know, has she got a kicker there or?
[00:16:34] Abby Jorgensen: No, she just has like an indoor bike thing.
[00:16:39] Abby Jorgensen: Yeah, forget that.
[00:16:40] Abby Jorgensen: Yeah.
[00:16:42] Abby Jorgensen: I mean, how do I, I mean, she keeps complaining about the wind and how it's like not like anything else.
[00:16:47] Abby Jorgensen: And I was like, well, it's just practice with the wind.
[00:16:50] Abby Jorgensen: mean, you never know what type of wind you're going to have no matter where you're at.
[00:16:54] Abby Jorgensen: So where, where, where was she exactly?
[00:16:57] Gerard Donnelly: Hmm, sorry.
[00:16:58] Gerard Donnelly: Uh, somewhere.
[00:17:00] Abby Jorgensen: Like the Canary Islands, I don't know if it's like the exact location or what that is.
[00:17:08] Gerard Donnelly: Why don't we just look up the wind for her, see what's going on.
[00:17:18] Gerard Donnelly: Canary, yep, okay.
[00:17:30] Gerard Donnelly: Where does she start?
[00:17:32] Gerard Donnelly: She starts in.
[00:17:47] Gerard Donnelly: Pick up the weather for Canary Islands.
[00:17:52] Gerard Donnelly: Thank you.
[00:17:55] Gerard Donnelly: Thank And,
[00:18:03] Gerard Donnelly: It does say wind.
[00:18:07] Gerard Donnelly: Thursday there's no wind, and Saturday there's no wind.
[00:18:12] Gerard Donnelly: Yeah, she's right.
[00:18:15] Gerard Donnelly: Okay.
[00:18:16] Gerard Donnelly: The wind on Tuesday.
[00:18:20] Gerard Donnelly: It's pretty windy.
[00:18:23] Gerard Donnelly: 25 k's an hour, gusting up to 40.
[00:18:27] Gerard Donnelly: So that is windy.
[00:18:30] Gerard Donnelly: But it's not on Thursday.
[00:18:36] Abby Jorgensen: Yeah, 8 to 16 miles an hour.
[00:18:45] Abby Jorgensen: Windy, but...
[00:18:46] Gerard Donnelly: The afternoon, I don't know how quickly it gets dark, but it's like at 2 o'clock, it's 16 kilometres an hour.
[00:19:02] Gerard Donnelly: So it's, it's, it's, you know, it's a normal wind that I'll be, I could write in, no problem, Saturdays.
[00:19:10] Gerard Donnelly: It's windy, but it's, to her credit, you know, it does say windy today and tomorrow on Wednesday, but that's it.
[00:19:23] Gerard Donnelly: Okay?
[00:19:24] Gerard Donnelly: Yep.
[00:19:25] Gerard Donnelly: So I would say to her, look, you know, if it's too windy to ride on Tuesday, then just jump on the trainer in, indoor.
[00:19:36] Gerard Donnelly: Just do an easy run on the treadmill.
[00:19:39] Gerard Donnelly: If you think it's too dangerous, I would be, yeah, I'd make a whole list of things.
[00:19:45] Gerard Donnelly: I don't know whether you're better off calling or Abby, but.
[00:19:49] Gerard Donnelly: I might have to this time.
[00:19:51] Abby Jorgensen: Yeah.
[00:19:56] Gerard Donnelly: And that 30, 30s, you could do it on a gym bike, indoor.
[00:19:59] Gerard Donnelly: Yeah.
[00:19:59] Gerard Donnelly: Yeah.
[00:19:59] Gerard Donnelly: Yeah.
[00:20:00] Gerard Donnelly: Just use RPE.
[00:20:02] Gerard Donnelly: Okay.
[00:20:03] Abby Jorgensen: Okay.
[00:20:04] Abby Jorgensen: Yeah.
[00:20:05] Abby Jorgensen: She's probably asleep right now, but I'll try tomorrow or over in the morning.
[00:20:11] Gerard Donnelly: Just leave a message to her saying, I had a chat to Gerard, I want to quickly have a call with you when you wake up or whatever.
[00:20:23] Gerard Donnelly: And look, you know, if she trained Thursday afternoon, you know, it's quite windy in the morning, but it's certainly decreasing by the afternoon.
[00:20:36] Gerard Donnelly: So really, in the early morning, it's 8 a.m., it's 22 kilometers an hour, which I don't know, that's, what's that, 10 miles an hour?
[00:20:46] Gerard Donnelly: Yeah.
[00:20:47] Abby Jorgensen: Maybe more, 14 miles an hour.
[00:20:52] Gerard Donnelly: But, you know, you're okay in that, aren't you?
[00:20:54] Gerard Donnelly: I'm not okay in that.
[00:20:54] Gerard Donnelly: I mean, we have that all the time in the spring.
[00:20:57] Abby Jorgensen: Yeah.
[00:20:58] Gerard Donnelly: You're going to have to race in those winds.
[00:21:00] Gerard Donnelly: So that would be, you know, get used to it.
[00:21:02] Gerard Donnelly: But even if she did that at, you know, at like one o'clock, it's already dropped to 18, you know, well, kilometres an hour.
[00:21:10] Gerard Donnelly: So, but I think she'll have no trouble on the rest of the week.
[00:21:17] Gerard Donnelly: And, you know, if she wanted to go for an easy recovery ride after the run on Sunday, that's okay as well.
[00:21:26] Gerard Donnelly: So, you know, but they have to be easy, Abby.
[00:21:29] Gerard Donnelly: Otherwise, you're not, you're not recovering.
[00:21:35] Gerard Donnelly: So if you feel, like it's Monday for you, Tuesday for me, if you feel you're not getting through before Thursday, yell out and I'll call her.
[00:21:46] Abby Jorgensen: Okay.
[00:21:48] Abby Jorgensen: Right?
[00:21:50] Gerard Donnelly: The idea is that your, your execution is the key.
[00:21:57] Gerard Donnelly: And.
[00:21:59] Gerard Donnelly: Okay.
[00:22:00] Gerard Donnelly: And it's not a pass or fail thing.
[00:22:02] Gerard Donnelly: It's an opportunity for you to test yourself.
[00:22:07] Gerard Donnelly: My big thing, if I'm talking to you, I'd be saying, I really want to know where my levels are.
[00:22:14] Gerard Donnelly: A, so I can train properly.
[00:22:16] Gerard Donnelly: B, so I know whether I'm improving.
[00:22:19] Gerard Donnelly: And it's really good feedback.
[00:22:21] Gerard Donnelly: And you would have to say to her, you know, you've trained really well.
[00:22:27] Gerard Donnelly: I don't know when the last time was she tested.
[00:22:30] Gerard Donnelly: Um, so, like, haven't, like, the 30th of July is the last indoor, is that right?
[00:22:37] Gerard Donnelly: Uh, last indoor, but she did an outdoor when she got to the islands.
[00:22:42] Abby Jorgensen: did an outdoor one.
[00:22:44] Gerard Donnelly: 270.
[00:22:46] Gerard Donnelly: Sorry, 248.
[00:22:50] Gerard Donnelly: That was on the 4th of December.
[00:22:51] Gerard Donnelly: And did you have a pushback on that?
[00:22:54] Abby Jorgensen: No, she, she was like, yeah, we need to obviously test because we're going to be training here the are you Rock .
[00:23:00] Abby Jorgensen: For the next, you know, five weeks or whatever.
[00:23:02] Abby Jorgensen: Yeah, I don't know.
[00:23:09] Abby Jorgensen: I don't know if, like, you know how she's, like, part of that, like, new coaching group?
[00:23:13] Abby Jorgensen: Like, I don't know if, like, she hasn't said anything, but it makes me curious if, like, they don't believe in that stuff.
[00:23:21] Abby Jorgensen: So, like, they're, like, getting into her head or somebody there has gotten into her head about it all.
[00:23:28] Abby Jorgensen: Like, it makes me wonder.
[00:23:33] Gerard Donnelly: That's right.
[00:23:34] Gerard Donnelly: She did it in one direction, didn't she?
[00:23:38] Abby Jorgensen: No.
[00:23:39] Abby Jorgensen: Yeah.
[00:23:40] Abby Jorgensen: Yeah.
[00:23:41] Abby Jorgensen: She did.
[00:23:42] Abby Jorgensen: Did the whole thing.
[00:23:44] Gerard Donnelly: Just an ounce.
[00:23:48] Gerard Donnelly: So, 25 days an hour.
[00:23:52] Gerard Donnelly: I mean, that just doesn't make sense.
[00:23:55] Gerard Donnelly: That's, that's, like, I don't know, 14 miles an hour.
[00:23:59] Gerard Donnelly: be So,
[00:24:00] Abby Jorgensen: I think she complained that that one was into the wind too.
[00:24:04] Abby Jorgensen: But that's a whole idea.
[00:24:05] Gerard Donnelly: Yeah, like it shouldn't matter with your power if you're into the wind or not.
[00:24:09] Gerard Donnelly: But we want to see what the speed is, Abby.
[00:24:12] Gerard Donnelly: So we don't want them to do one direction.
[00:24:14] Gerard Donnelly: We want them to do out and back.
[00:24:16] Gerard Donnelly: And any of those race-ready sessions, FTP sessions, all the time we're trying to find what the power is compared to the speed.
[00:24:25] Gerard Donnelly: That's the key concept of these sessions is when you do it in one direction, that is useless information to me.
[00:24:34] Gerard Donnelly: The power is great.
[00:24:35] Gerard Donnelly: I can use that.
[00:24:36] Gerard Donnelly: But I've got no information about what that power equals in speed.
[00:24:42] Gerard Donnelly: And that's – speed's everything, you know.
[00:24:46] Gerard Donnelly: If you want to do a three-hour night, you know, 70.3 bike or a two-hour 30 or a two-hour, you've got to work out, you know, 30.
[00:25:00] Gerard Donnelly: 30Ks an hour is three hours.
[00:25:02] Gerard Donnelly: Now, 35Ks an hour is two and a half hours.
[00:25:05] Gerard Donnelly: 40Ks an hour is two hours.
[00:25:09] Gerard Donnelly: So you've got to work out what power gives me 40Ks an hour, what power gives me 30Ks an hour.
[00:25:15] Gerard Donnelly: So having the power is great.
[00:25:17] Gerard Donnelly: That's perfect because we can stay in the ranges.
[00:25:20] Gerard Donnelly: But the next step is knowing what that power equals in speed so we can predict your time.
[00:25:28] Gerard Donnelly: So you've got to drill this into all your athletes.
[00:25:31] Gerard Donnelly: You know, we're not asking you to go out and back because it's fancy.
[00:25:34] Gerard Donnelly: We're asking you to go out and back because it could be a headwind out and a tailwind back.
[00:25:39] Gerard Donnelly: It could be no wind, so it doesn't matter.
[00:25:41] Gerard Donnelly: But it's unlikely there's going to be no wind in any given day in the world.
[00:25:45] Gerard Donnelly: It's going to be at least two or three miles an hour, which is going to be a little bit faster in one direction, slower in the other.
[00:25:52] Gerard Donnelly: But all the time we're trying to get the speed to equate to the power.
[00:25:57] Gerard Donnelly: So, yeah.
[00:26:00] Gerard Donnelly: And, you know, there's just so many reasons why, if you can make notes on, you know, so we've got great practice at execution, we've got understanding what the power is against your speed, knowing that we're going to train correctly in the next range of, in the ranges for the next block of training, understanding whether we've improved.
[00:26:33] Gerard Donnelly: Making sure that we have the right perspective about improvement, if we've been doing specifically endurance training or been doing specifically FTP, VO2 stuff.
[00:26:43] Gerard Donnelly: So the expectation with just endurance stuff is that our FTP may stay the same, you know, we've been doing long, long endurance training with no specific threshold VO2.
[00:26:54] Gerard Donnelly: So there's kind of five, five reasons.
[00:26:58] Gerard Donnelly: And, you know,
[00:27:00] Gerard Donnelly: You get confidence from all the athletes that we coach when they improve.
[00:27:05] Gerard Donnelly: They're just gaining confidence the whole time.
[00:27:09] Gerard Donnelly: So, yeah.
[00:27:15] Gerard Donnelly: Okay.
[00:27:16] Abby Jorgensen: Yeah, that makes sense.
[00:27:17] Abby Jorgensen: Anything else on her?
[00:27:19] Abby Jorgensen: No, that was the big thing this week with her.
[00:27:24] Gerard Donnelly: Don't let her do that 60-minute in one direction.
[00:27:27] Gerard Donnelly: It's got to be two 15 minutes out and back.
[00:27:30] Gerard Donnelly: For the first 30 minutes and then two 15 minutes out.
[00:27:32] Gerard Donnelly: And, look, the turns, that's part of racing.
[00:27:35] Gerard Donnelly: We turn in races.
[00:27:38] Gerard Donnelly: So get used to it.
[00:27:43] Gerard Donnelly: And that way you're not sitting in a block headwind for the whole ride, you know.
[00:27:48] Gerard Donnelly: We want to have practice at tailwind.
[00:27:50] Gerard Donnelly: You know, in every race we do, some people are really bad at riding tailwind because they haven't, you know, they haven't done any of this.
[00:27:58] Gerard Donnelly: Everything we're trying to to do do
[00:28:00] Gerard Donnelly: Do in training is because it could happen in the race scenario.
[00:28:06] Gerard Donnelly: You know, when we get closer to Nice, we would be getting her to do hill climb FTPs.
[00:28:11] Gerard Donnelly: Talk to her about that.
[00:28:13] Gerard Donnelly: You know, at the moment, we want to, because we're training normally, we want to know what your number is.
[00:28:20] Gerard Donnelly: You know, we're training for an Ironman at the moment.
[00:28:23] Gerard Donnelly: So we really need to know what your number is for 60 minutes.
[00:28:26] Gerard Donnelly: And we're trying to prove to her, Abby, that the 20-minute FTP and the 60-minute FTP aren't the same.
[00:28:32] Gerard Donnelly: You know that yourself.
[00:28:34] Gerard Donnelly: 20 minutes is great for training.
[00:28:37] Gerard Donnelly: 60 minutes is great for racing.
[00:28:39] Gerard Donnelly: That's why we're doing two separate FTPs.
[00:28:44] Gerard Donnelly: Because from all our historical data, if we let our athletes go 75% to 90% of their 20-minute, the range is too high.
[00:28:52] Gerard Donnelly: If we go 75% to 90% of our 60-minute, it's spot on for racing.
[00:29:04] Abby Jorgensen: Okay.
[00:29:06] Gerard Donnelly: We better fly through the rest.
[00:29:09] Abby Jorgensen: Yeah.
[00:29:09] Abby Jorgensen: Sorry.
[00:29:10] Abby Jorgensen: I knew she was going to be the big point today because I told her I'd.
[00:29:16] Abby Jorgensen: You happy with that?
[00:29:17] Abby Jorgensen: Yeah.
[00:29:18] Abby Jorgensen: No, that makes sense.
[00:29:19] Abby Jorgensen: I mean, that's all I was thinking.
[00:29:20] Abby Jorgensen: I just wanted to verify it so that I kind of had a, you know, backup.
[00:29:27] Abby Jorgensen: Yeah.
[00:29:27] Gerard Donnelly: You've got to, you know what you're doing, Abby.
[00:29:30] Gerard Donnelly: Okay.
[00:29:31] Gerard Donnelly: You've got to have more confidence and you've got to be convincing.
[00:29:36] Gerard Donnelly: And if you're not explaining it to her well enough, then you've got to think about how you're explaining it.
[00:29:42] Gerard Donnelly: If they're still pushing back, that could be just a mindset.
[00:29:44] Gerard Donnelly: It's nothing you can do about that.
[00:29:47] Gerard Donnelly: But you've got to try to give a, you know, and you've got to be confident that this is, this is what works, Coco.
[00:29:55] Gerard Donnelly: You know, if we thought there was a better way, we would be doing it.
[00:29:58] Gerard Donnelly: But this is the best way.
[00:30:01] Gerard Donnelly: You know, we don't have seven world champions because we've got a flawed system.
[00:30:07] Gerard Donnelly: You know, they're the things you would be bringing up to us.
[00:30:11] Gerard Donnelly: You know, we already have seven world champions in triathlon.
[00:30:17] Gerard Donnelly: So, and most of it, you know, majority of our athletes who do the program this way have incredible improvement and you're no different.
[00:30:30] Gerard Donnelly: You know, I'm coaching three athletes who are doing, I don't know, there's three other athletes who are doing New Zealand.
[00:30:38] Gerard Donnelly: I'm coaching one of them, you're coaching one of them, Paul's coaching one of them.
[00:30:42] Gerard Donnelly: I think there's actually another one, four athletes.
[00:30:45] Gerard Donnelly: And they're all testing in these weeks, you know, because we want to make sure we're testing right now for this last build into the race ready phase.
[00:30:55] Gerard Donnelly: Because we'll be starting to do race ready stuff where, you know, we're wanting her to do 160.
[00:31:00] Gerard Donnelly: $160K, $180K, just like you've been, you know, for your Ironman prep.
[00:31:06] Gerard Donnelly: Okay, Doogie, our problem child is...
[00:31:09] Abby Jorgensen: Yeah, I talked to him yesterday, and he admits it's been hard to get back into the routine, but he's hoping today kind of gets back into a routine.
[00:31:20] Abby Jorgensen: So we'll see how this week goes for him.
[00:31:22] Abby Jorgensen: Okay, well, I'll leave that with you.
[00:31:25] Gerard Donnelly: Yeah.
[00:31:26] Gerard Donnelly: Andrew, no problem?
[00:31:27] Gerard Donnelly: No problem at all.
[00:31:28] Abby Jorgensen: I had a conversation with him on how we were going to kind of structure the next few weeks, and we're good.
[00:31:36] Abby Jorgensen: So...
[00:31:36] Gerard Donnelly: Yep, he's going to test this week to align the sand.
[00:31:40] Gerard Donnelly: Great.
[00:31:42] Gerard Donnelly: Sin, he's back from...
[00:31:44] Gerard Donnelly: Yeah, he's back from...
[00:31:46] Abby Jorgensen: So we're just going to try to get back into a swing of things today.
[00:31:53] Abby Jorgensen: Yep.
[00:31:55] Gerard Donnelly: Wonder if the pool is closed.
[00:31:57] Abby Jorgensen: Yep.
[00:31:59] Gerard Donnelly: Possibly, maybe.
[00:31:59] Abby Jorgensen: maybe.
[00:31:59] Abby Jorgensen: me.
[00:32:00] Abby Jorgensen: Yeah.
[00:32:02] Gerard Donnelly: Okay.
[00:32:06] Gerard Donnelly: What's his goals again?
[00:32:07] Gerard Donnelly: Just remind me, has he got something coming?
[00:32:10] Gerard Donnelly: Did it not happen?
[00:32:11] Abby Jorgensen: Ironman.
[00:32:12] Gerard Donnelly: Yeah.
[00:32:13] Gerard Donnelly: That's great.
[00:32:14] Gerard Donnelly: 16 weeks.
[00:32:15] Gerard Donnelly: Yeah.
[00:32:16] Abby Jorgensen: Okay, Chris.
[00:32:18] Gerard Donnelly: Chris testing this week as well.
[00:32:21] Abby Jorgensen: It would be his first test week, or I mean, second, I guess, but first.
[00:32:29] Abby Jorgensen: First after the training, so.
[00:32:31] Abby Jorgensen: Yep.
[00:32:32] Gerard Donnelly: So he did 2.14, 2.13, and he did 1.99, 2.09, 2.13, 2.30.
[00:32:43] Gerard Donnelly: So we would predict that he should start around that 2.10.
[00:32:47] Gerard Donnelly: 2.10, okay.
[00:32:49] Gerard Donnelly: So maybe give him a little bit of coaching about the FTP.
[00:32:54] Gerard Donnelly: Okay, yep.
[00:32:55] Gerard Donnelly: If you feel he's trained well, Abby, just looking at his...
[00:33:00] Gerard Donnelly: Last FTP, he really did what we asked, start conservative and finish strong.
[00:33:04] Gerard Donnelly: And now, look, he started at 199 and ended up with an average of 213.
[00:33:09] Gerard Donnelly: So, you know, we could start at 210.
[00:33:14] Gerard Donnelly: So, you know, do what I'm doing.
[00:33:16] Gerard Donnelly: Look at his spreadsheet to see what his five minutes and 10 minutes were last time and talk to him about it.
[00:33:24] Gerard Donnelly: I would be saying, hey, Abby, what's your plan for this upcoming test?
[00:33:28] Gerard Donnelly: That's how I'd start.
[00:33:30] Gerard Donnelly: Why are you doing that?
[00:33:32] Gerard Donnelly: You're doing that because you want him to prove to you that he's thinking about the strategy rather than just, I'm just going to go and do this training session with no plan.
[00:33:43] Gerard Donnelly: So we're trying to get them to get this idea of every time we do some racing or testing, we have to have a plan.
[00:33:49] Gerard Donnelly: You know, just like you and I said, you know, our plan for you is, you know, 293.
[00:33:55] Gerard Donnelly: We're going to start around the 280.
[00:33:56] Gerard Donnelly: Just that little conversation.
[00:33:58] Gerard Donnelly: And already you've got...
[00:33:58] Gerard Donnelly: And already you've got...
[00:34:00] Gerard Donnelly: But in your head, this is what I'm going to do.
[00:34:02] Gerard Donnelly: And if I feel good, I can push on.
[00:34:03] Gerard Donnelly: If I don't feel good, I'm staying where I am.
[00:34:07] Gerard Donnelly: All right.
[00:34:08] Gerard Donnelly: So especially the new people, don't let the second FTP, you know, they've done their original starting FTP, the second FTP, they really need help with.
[00:34:20] Gerard Donnelly: But you don't give the help first.
[00:34:22] Gerard Donnelly: You ask them what your plan is.
[00:34:25] Gerard Donnelly: Right.
[00:34:26] Gerard Donnelly: Then you give the coaching tip.
[00:34:28] Gerard Donnelly: Right.
[00:34:28] Gerard Donnelly: So we don't want to get used to giving them spoon feeding it, spoon feeding them.
[00:34:35] Gerard Donnelly: We want them to think.
[00:34:36] Gerard Donnelly: We want them to be involved in the process.
[00:34:38] Gerard Donnelly: And if you just keep giving them the answers, which is not what you're doing, but I'm just thinking, yeah, same with the swim, same with the run.
[00:34:48] Gerard Donnelly: You know, what did he run last time?
[00:34:52] Abby Jorgensen: 5K.
[00:34:52] Abby Jorgensen: Yeah, last time.
[00:34:54] Abby Jorgensen: Yeah.
[00:34:54] Abby Jorgensen: So he's done a 23.
[00:34:56] Gerard Donnelly: That's not a bad run.
[00:34:58] Gerard Donnelly: And, yeah.
[00:35:00] Gerard Donnelly: He executed fantastic, and remind him how well he executed in the first trials.
[00:35:07] Gerard Donnelly: So whenever you can work out 439 paces in miles.
[00:35:12] Gerard Donnelly: So that's what he did at the end last time, 439.
[00:35:15] Gerard Donnelly: So I would be saying, you know, start around there.
[00:35:21] Gerard Donnelly: And his swim wasn't too bad either, 148 pace.
[00:35:25] Gerard Donnelly: But unless you've got form goggles, you're not going to know what your pace is anyway.
[00:35:28] Gerard Donnelly: Yeah, I won't help you.
[00:35:30] Abby Jorgensen: Yeah, so all right with that?
[00:35:32] Gerard Donnelly: Yep, he's a pretty analytical guy too, so he likes numbers.
[00:35:36] Abby Jorgensen: Good.
[00:35:38] Abby Jorgensen: Kevin, how's he doing?
[00:35:40] Abby Jorgensen: Yes, checking off the boxes, doing pretty good.
[00:35:43] Abby Jorgensen: I think, did he have an FTP or was that last time we already talked about his FTP?
[00:35:48] Abby Jorgensen: I we did talk.
[00:35:49] Gerard Donnelly: I think he was going really well.
[00:35:50] Gerard Donnelly: Yeah, he did another 10, I think, or something.
[00:35:55] Gerard Donnelly: Yeah, 18th of December, yep, he went from 290 to 302.
[00:35:58] Gerard Donnelly: That's really good.
[00:36:00] Gerard Donnelly: You're doing a good job with him.
[00:36:01] Gerard Donnelly: You're doing a good job with everybody.
[00:36:02] Gerard Donnelly: But yeah, just that consistency.
[00:36:04] Gerard Donnelly: What a difference.
[00:36:07] Gerard Donnelly: You at him and frigging Dougie, bloody hell.
[00:36:11] Gerard Donnelly: It's just brilliant training.
[00:36:13] Abby Jorgensen: Dougie, he used to be.
[00:36:15] Abby Jorgensen: Yeah.
[00:36:16] Abby Jorgensen: Yeah.
[00:36:16] Abby Jorgensen: There's a life, I think.
[00:36:18] Abby Jorgensen: Point that out to him.
[00:36:22] Gerard Donnelly: So he's just in his last week.
[00:36:23] Gerard Donnelly: Good.
[00:36:23] Gerard Donnelly: Richard?
[00:36:26] Abby Jorgensen: He is good.
[00:36:28] Abby Jorgensen: He tested last week.
[00:36:30] Abby Jorgensen: So he PB'd his swim, which we're really happy about.
[00:36:35] Abby Jorgensen: He is kind of back up.
[00:36:37] Abby Jorgensen: He had his second best FTP, even though he faded.
[00:36:41] Abby Jorgensen: He said that he felt he had a cold and he should have maybe pushed it back.
[00:36:46] Abby Jorgensen: But I was like, you still are back up to where you were.
[00:36:50] Abby Jorgensen: Yeah.
[00:36:52] Gerard Donnelly: So in November, he did 178.
[00:36:55] Gerard Donnelly: What was the problem with that one?
[00:36:59] Abby Jorgensen: I'm trying to.
[00:37:00] Abby Jorgensen: I remember.
[00:37:02] Abby Jorgensen: I think the same thing.
[00:37:03] Abby Jorgensen: He just didn't feel his best self.
[00:37:07] Abby Jorgensen: 27th of November.
[00:37:09] Gerard Donnelly: Have you done one since then?
[00:37:14] Abby Jorgensen: November 27th?
[00:37:15] Abby Jorgensen: Oh, because he had a couple of weeks here on vacation, holiday.
[00:37:19] Gerard Donnelly: That was before that one, was it?
[00:37:22] Gerard Donnelly: Yeah.
[00:37:29] Gerard Donnelly: 27th.
[00:37:30] Gerard Donnelly: Come on.
[00:37:32] Gerard Donnelly: Where is it 27th?
[00:37:35] Gerard Donnelly: Is it December?
[00:37:38] Gerard Donnelly: Oh, yeah.
[00:37:39] Gerard Donnelly: You're in December.
[00:37:44] Abby Jorgensen: TrainingPeaks is slow sometimes.
[00:37:46] Abby Jorgensen: Yeah.
[00:37:57] Gerard Donnelly: That's interesting.
[00:37:58] Gerard Donnelly: He had 201 for his group ride.
[00:38:02] Gerard Donnelly: Oh, yeah, this is the one where the glitch happened.
[00:38:22] Gerard Donnelly: He didn't, he didn't, yeah.
[00:38:27] Gerard Donnelly: He didn't start too high.
[00:38:29] Gerard Donnelly: He didn't do much wrong.
[00:38:30] Gerard Donnelly: I don't understand that.
[00:38:31] Abby Jorgensen: No.
[00:38:35] Abby Jorgensen: We kept, I kept his numbers the same.
[00:38:37] Abby Jorgensen: Yep.
[00:38:38] Abby Jorgensen: And he, he was hitting them, so.
[00:38:40] Abby Jorgensen: Yep, good.
[00:38:41] Abby Jorgensen: And was off.
[00:38:45] Gerard Donnelly: And he's tested fine.
[00:38:47] Gerard Donnelly: Look, he's, he started at 201.
[00:38:49] Gerard Donnelly: I think that was pretty gutsy, Abby.
[00:38:52] Abby Jorgensen: Yeah, told him that when I talked to him.
[00:38:55] Abby Jorgensen: Yep.
[00:38:55] Gerard Donnelly: She's gone 201, 204, 198, 195.
[00:38:58] Gerard Donnelly: Yeah, so.
[00:38:59] Gerard Donnelly: So.
[00:39:00] Gerard Donnelly: And you especially when he failed the last one in Nebuchadnezzar, I don't know what people think.
[00:39:09] Gerard Donnelly: I'm not willing to do that to myself.
[00:39:11] Gerard Donnelly: Are you?
[00:39:12] Abby Jorgensen: Oh, not after, not after when you get to a point where you fail one.
[00:39:17] Abby Jorgensen: Yeah.
[00:39:18] Abby Jorgensen: Like, I don't want the last 10 minutes to be a sufferfest, that's for sure.
[00:39:27] Gerard Donnelly: It was fine, for sure.
[00:39:30] Gerard Donnelly: 194, 190.
[00:39:34] Gerard Donnelly: He just got carried away in the middle.
[00:39:38] Abby Jorgensen: You've had a chat to him about that?
[00:39:40] Gerard Donnelly: Yeah, we've about it, through it all.
[00:39:43] Abby Jorgensen: Yep.
[00:39:45] Gerard Donnelly: He's 5K, is he happy with that?
[00:39:47] Abby Jorgensen: Yeah, because he's been coming back from an injury, so.
[00:39:51] Abby Jorgensen: Yes.
[00:39:52] Abby Jorgensen: He's been at the swim, too.
[00:39:54] Abby Jorgensen: Like, you know, he had that bicep surgery, so hitting up in the swim.
[00:39:59] Abby Jorgensen: said, yeah.
[00:39:59] Abby Jorgensen: Thank
[00:40:00] Gerard Donnelly: Yeah, good.
[00:40:02] Abby Jorgensen: So he picked some races too and is going to finalize his schedule.
[00:40:08] Abby Jorgensen: Great.
[00:40:12] Gerard Donnelly: well, that's actually not a bad execution in the 5K.
[00:40:16] Gerard Donnelly: Like he's done 547 and 540 for the second half.
[00:40:22] Gerard Donnelly: So that's great.
[00:40:25] Gerard Donnelly: Has he been running much during the...
[00:40:28] Abby Jorgensen: Yeah, we've gradually increased it.
[00:40:30] Abby Jorgensen: So I added another one, another run this week.
[00:40:38] Gerard Donnelly: Is he back to running normally again?
[00:40:41] Gerard Donnelly: Yeah.
[00:40:43] Abby Jorgensen: Okay.
[00:40:51] Gerard Donnelly: Is there a reason, Abby, why he does his long rides on Sunday?
[00:40:57] Abby Jorgensen: That's when the bunch goes.
[00:40:59] Abby Jorgensen: Yeah.
[00:40:59] Abby Jorgensen: it.
[00:41:00] Abby Jorgensen: Okay.
[00:41:00] Abby Jorgensen: Yeah.
[00:41:02] Abby Jorgensen: All right.
[00:41:04] Gerard Donnelly: I'm happy for him to do the bunch.
[00:41:06] Gerard Donnelly: That's fine.
[00:41:06] Gerard Donnelly: I think we need another run.
[00:41:08] Gerard Donnelly: Another run?
[00:41:09] Gerard Donnelly: Okay.
[00:41:13] Gerard Donnelly: So I would consider doing the bike on Wednesday, Friday.
[00:41:20] Gerard Donnelly: Is there a reason he couldn't ride Friday?
[00:41:24] Abby Jorgensen: I don't think so.
[00:41:26] Gerard Donnelly: And I would do his run Tuesday, Thursday, Saturday, and then run off the bike.
[00:41:33] Gerard Donnelly: Okay.
[00:41:34] Abby Jorgensen: I mean, I have one Monday here.
[00:41:38] Abby Jorgensen: Say that again?
[00:41:39] Gerard Donnelly: Oh, sorry.
[00:41:41] Abby Jorgensen: Sorry, I didn't see it.
[00:41:42] Abby Jorgensen: You've got four runs.
[00:41:43] Abby Jorgensen: He just missed it.
[00:41:44] Abby Jorgensen: Yeah, okay.
[00:41:48] Gerard Donnelly: Yeah, no, what you've got is right.
[00:41:50] Gerard Donnelly: But he needs not to miss it.
[00:41:52] Gerard Donnelly: Yeah.
[00:41:53] Abby Jorgensen: It's only two o'clock there right now.
[00:41:55] Abby Jorgensen: Oh, sorry.
[00:41:56] Abby Jorgensen: Yeah, okay.
[00:41:57] Abby Jorgensen: Yeah.
[00:41:59] Gerard Donnelly: No, that's fine.
[00:42:00] Gerard Donnelly: Leave it like that.
[00:42:01] Gerard Donnelly: That's fine.
[00:42:02] Abby Jorgensen: Yep.
[00:42:04] Gerard Donnelly: Okay.
[00:42:04] Gerard Donnelly: Anything else on him?
[00:42:06] Abby Jorgensen: No, he's good.
[00:42:07] Abby Jorgensen: Now that we have some races, he's not going to do anything over like an Olympic distance.
[00:42:11] Abby Jorgensen: So.
[00:42:12] Abby Jorgensen: Great.
[00:42:13] Abby Jorgensen: Yep.
[00:42:14] Abby Jorgensen: Okay.
[00:42:14] Gerard Donnelly: Let's back into the groove.
[00:42:16] Abby Jorgensen: Yeah.
[00:42:17] Abby Jorgensen: And she got the power meter on her TT bike yesterday.
[00:42:22] Abby Jorgensen: Fantastic.
[00:42:23] Abby Jorgensen: So we'll test on Thursday.
[00:42:27] Abby Jorgensen: Yep.
[00:42:28] Gerard Donnelly: Yep.
[00:42:30] Gerard Donnelly: So just remind her that we don't have data from this power meter.
[00:42:34] Gerard Donnelly: I have.
[00:42:35] Abby Jorgensen: She's already like freaking out.
[00:42:38] Abby Jorgensen: Yep.
[00:42:38] Gerard Donnelly: So in the warmup, she'll get an idea of the ramp, you know, the two minute, two minute, two minute, one minute.
[00:42:45] Gerard Donnelly: I'll let her take notice of what does it feel like?
[00:42:48] Gerard Donnelly: Is it, is it, is the level I've got too hard or is it too easy?
[00:42:54] Abby Jorgensen: Same with the session.
[00:42:57] Abby Jorgensen: Yeah, exactly.
[00:42:59] Gerard Donnelly: Yeah.
[00:43:02] Gerard Donnelly: And is she doing a run or is she injured?
[00:43:06] Gerard Donnelly: She's injured.
[00:43:07] Abby Jorgensen: Well, she's coming back from an injury.
[00:43:08] Abby Jorgensen: So we have to gradually repeat.
[00:43:11] Abby Jorgensen: She wants her gradually back into it.
[00:43:13] Abby Jorgensen: So.
[00:43:15] Gerard Donnelly: So just two runs at the moment.
[00:43:19] Abby Jorgensen: Yeah, I mean, she did two last week.
[00:43:23] Abby Jorgensen: And her physio is like, she's getting stronger.
[00:43:26] Abby Jorgensen: Or she said no more than like, you know, the five to 10% more each week.
[00:43:30] Abby Jorgensen: that's fine.
[00:43:33] Abby Jorgensen: What's her race?
[00:43:39] Abby Jorgensen: Wanaka, whatever.
[00:43:40] Abby Jorgensen: It's going to be a bit tough to do that 20K.
[00:43:48] Gerard Donnelly: Actually, is it?
[00:43:50] Gerard Donnelly: Do you know what the distance is?
[00:43:56] Abby Jorgensen: I think it's a 70.3.
[00:43:58] Abby Jorgensen: I think
[00:44:00] Abby Jorgensen: Unless I'm thinking of something different.
[00:44:02] Abby Jorgensen: Yeah, it's a half.
[00:44:04] Gerard Donnelly: Yeah, it's a half.
[00:44:05] Gerard Donnelly: So you might have to say to her, look, you know, we've got to be up.
[00:44:11] Gerard Donnelly: You might have to do an aqua bike if you're not ready to run.
[00:44:15] Gerard Donnelly: Okay.
[00:44:17] Abby Jorgensen: Still do the event, but, you know.
[00:44:20] Gerard Donnelly: Or we may just have to get off and run nice and easy, not race.
[00:44:25] Abby Jorgensen: Yeah.
[00:44:26] Gerard Donnelly: Okay.
[00:44:27] Gerard Donnelly: Blair?
[00:44:28] Abby Jorgensen: He's still on vacation.
[00:44:31] Abby Jorgensen: Yep, okay.
[00:44:32] Gerard Donnelly: So.
[00:44:33] Gerard Donnelly: Not much happening there.
[00:44:35] Gerard Donnelly: Yeah.
[00:44:40] Gerard Donnelly: He's a good trainer, isn't he, normally?
[00:44:41] Gerard Donnelly: Yeah.
[00:44:42] Abby Jorgensen: I mean, he did send me a picture of them skiing.
[00:44:45] Abby Jorgensen: Yeah.
[00:44:46] Abby Jorgensen: I know.
[00:44:47] Gerard Donnelly: I've got a couple of, well, two or three people skiing, and I've got them running easy on the treadmill in the ski hotel gym.
[00:44:55] Abby Jorgensen: Yeah, I asked him if he wanted to do, like, anything.
[00:44:57] Abby Jorgensen: I mean, he said no.
[00:44:59] Abby Jorgensen: So.
[00:45:00] Abby Jorgensen: So I was like, I mean, he has time till August, so he knows that he gets back.
[00:45:07] Gerard Donnelly: I got a lovely text from Pemberton.
[00:45:12] Gerard Donnelly: Yeah, that email that you forwarded me.
[00:45:15] Abby Jorgensen: Yeah.
[00:45:16] Abby Jorgensen: Email, sorry.
[00:45:17] Abby Jorgensen: Yeah.
[00:45:19] Gerard Donnelly: I've just got to, can you text me after we finish to remind me to reply?
[00:45:26] Gerard Donnelly: Yeah.
[00:45:30] Gerard Donnelly: So that's really great, Abby, that you get feedback like that.
[00:45:34] Gerard Donnelly: Yeah.
[00:45:35] Gerard Donnelly: That's absolutely fantastic.
[00:45:36] Gerard Donnelly: And I would have thought she was going to be hard, but she's proven me wrong.
[00:45:40] Gerard Donnelly: So really well done.
[00:45:43] Gerard Donnelly: I always get the hard ones.
[00:45:46] Abby Jorgensen: These Americans tell you what.
[00:45:53] Gerard Donnelly: So she had the test in November, test in December, and she had the beta blocker in.
[00:45:59] Gerard Donnelly: site.
[00:45:59] Gerard Donnelly: to So
[00:46:01] Abby Jorgensen: Yeah, I think she was having troubles with the connection of whether it was the Wahoo or her power pedals, and so we were getting confused, so I think we have it all sorted out now.
[00:46:13] Abby Jorgensen: So once she tests you now, hopefully it's good to go, but she's been feeling good.
[00:46:19] Abby Jorgensen: So her knee was bothering her, but I gave her, she thought it was IT band, so of course I had to tell her, she was like, I'm rolling my IT band.
[00:46:28] Abby Jorgensen: And I'm like, you can't really roll out your IT band.
[00:46:31] Abby Jorgensen: So I gave her, you know, some glute exercises and hip, and now she says everything feels better.
[00:46:36] Abby Jorgensen: So.
[00:46:37] Abby Jorgensen: Well done.
[00:46:41] Abby Jorgensen: Gwaine?
[00:46:43] Gerard Donnelly: Back on track.
[00:46:46] Abby Jorgensen: We're testing him.
[00:46:47] Abby Jorgensen: He should be testing, I guess, today.
[00:46:53] Abby Jorgensen: So, yeah, he says the 70.3s are all dependent on when this next project he's
[00:47:00] Abby Jorgensen: Working on gets done, so everything's coming.
[00:47:03] Gerard Donnelly: Okay.
[00:47:05] Abby Jorgensen: But he's doing a sprint in February, but he wants to use his road bike, so we're going to, he's going to switch his pedals back and forth on his road bike and TT bike.
[00:47:16] Abby Jorgensen: What's his reasoning behind that?
[00:47:18] Abby Jorgensen: The sprint is, it's like a 5k loop, and there's like, it's really a fast loop, and he just wants to use his road bike.
[00:47:28] Abby Jorgensen: He's TT bike, it'd still be quicker.
[00:47:33] Gerard Donnelly: There's no way when I'm doing a time trial, I would ever ride my road bike.
[00:47:37] Gerard Donnelly: Yeah, I don't, because it's not like it's silly.
[00:47:40] Abby Jorgensen: I let him ride this weekend, because he's like, I just wanted to go do some hills and more volley, and I was like, that's totally fine.
[00:47:46] Abby Jorgensen: Like, we're still kind of like, get the joy back in everything.
[00:47:50] Abby Jorgensen: That's fantastic, Debbie, that's exactly right.
[00:47:54] Gerard Donnelly: How's Mario going?
[00:47:56] Abby Jorgensen: Good, so I called, well, we had a talk last night on the phone.
[00:47:59] Abby Jorgensen: know what?
[00:47:59] Abby Jorgensen: You
[00:48:00] Abby Jorgensen: Way back from vacation.
[00:48:01] Abby Jorgensen: Because if you look at his FTP last week, definitely I was like, he says it got hard.
[00:48:11] Abby Jorgensen: And then when I called him, I'm like, did it feel like the trainer was controlling you?
[00:48:17] Abby Jorgensen: And he's like, yeah.
[00:48:18] Abby Jorgensen: Yeah.
[00:48:19] Abby Jorgensen: So the trainer, which I don't understand why, because he says he doesn't use Swift and he doesn't use, like he was using his Wahoo app.
[00:48:30] Abby Jorgensen: Yeah, that's what's happening.
[00:48:32] Gerard Donnelly: That's at Erg mode for sure.
[00:48:34] Gerard Donnelly: Yeah.
[00:48:34] Abby Jorgensen: He said that he thought he turned it off.
[00:48:37] Abby Jorgensen: He's like, I swear, because he like took a picture for me, turned off Erg smoothing.
[00:48:42] Abby Jorgensen: He's like, I swear I turned it off.
[00:48:44] Abby Jorgensen: And I was like, you have to like, don't even open up the Wahoo app.
[00:48:48] Abby Jorgensen: Just like download it to your computer and go.
[00:48:52] Abby Jorgensen: Because the Wahoo app seemed, I had the same issues originally.
[00:48:56] Abby Jorgensen: Like the Wahoo app is not good.
[00:48:58] Abby Jorgensen: It just always wants to control.
[00:49:00] Gerard Donnelly: Yeah, and the bike computer, when you open up your bike computer, it'll say, power meter found, kicker, or bike.
[00:49:10] Gerard Donnelly: Is that what happens with you?
[00:49:12] Gerard Donnelly: Mine doesn't even find the kicker.
[00:49:14] Abby Jorgensen: Mine just finds my power meter.
[00:49:17] Gerard Donnelly: So kind of guide him through that.
[00:49:19] Gerard Donnelly: Yeah, I told him he was going to try it out.
[00:49:22] Abby Jorgensen: I'm like, try Tuesday's session.
[00:49:25] Abby Jorgensen: See if you can get your trainer to not control you.
[00:49:32] Abby Jorgensen: I was like, should be shifting.
[00:49:35] Abby Jorgensen: And then I gave him some options.
[00:49:36] Abby Jorgensen: I was like, I'll talk to you.
[00:49:38] Abby Jorgensen: I was like, we can either kind of use what I think, like the number that you got last week and see how you train to it, or we can read the test on Thursday.
[00:49:47] Gerard Donnelly: Yep, that's a brilliant answer.
[00:49:52] Gerard Donnelly: So he splits really well.
[00:49:54] Gerard Donnelly: Ten minutes were 175, 150.
[00:49:57] Gerard Donnelly: And then he did 170, 160, 150.
[00:50:01] Abby Jorgensen: Yeah, because he said that it just like the trainer, you look at the cadence, it goes from 90 to 30.
[00:50:08] Abby Jorgensen: So that definitely I could tell that the trainer was doing this.
[00:50:13] Gerard Donnelly: That's the spiral of death, isn't it?
[00:50:15] Abby Jorgensen: That's what I was like, something's not right here.
[00:50:19] Gerard Donnelly: How gutsy is he to keep riding?
[00:50:21] Gerard Donnelly: Right.
[00:50:22] Gerard Donnelly: That's what I said.
[00:50:23] Abby Jorgensen: He's like, he felt fine at that one.
[00:50:26] Abby Jorgensen: It had to have been holding him there.
[00:50:28] Abby Jorgensen: I don't know, it's holding him, for sure.
[00:50:30] Abby Jorgensen: Yeah.
[00:50:32] Abby Jorgensen: He said he felt good at that, so like I know he's probably capable of it, but.
[00:50:37] Gerard Donnelly: Look at his heart rate, 147 and it drops to 130.
[00:50:45] Gerard Donnelly: Yeah, maybe, yeah.
[00:50:50] Abby Jorgensen: I said his FTP to the, well, the average of 160 something, so then I just set it to the 159 or whatever the number ended up being.
[00:51:00] Abby Jorgensen: Well, 154, is that right?
[00:51:02] Gerard Donnelly: Yeah, whatever.
[00:51:03] Abby Jorgensen: Yeah, 95% of the 160.
[00:51:07] Gerard Donnelly: Well, that should be easy enough for him to do it.
[00:51:09] Gerard Donnelly: Yeah.
[00:51:10] Abby Jorgensen: That's right.
[00:51:12] Abby Jorgensen: Good.
[00:51:14] Abby Jorgensen: So we'll see how he, what he, I told him don't even, yeah, just close out Wahoo app completely and without.
[00:51:22] Abby Jorgensen: Okay.
[00:51:23] Gerard Donnelly: Mark?
[00:51:26] Abby Jorgensen: Uh, well, he, he opened up, yeah, he opened up to me a little bit and he was like, this is part of what his mental battles have been lately, which understandable.
[00:51:41] Abby Jorgensen: But yeah, he went to the doctor.
[00:51:43] Abby Jorgensen: They say the knee pain is coming from just weak hips, which I'm like every runner.
[00:51:49] Abby Jorgensen: Um, so he has some exercises to do there.
[00:51:53] Abby Jorgensen: So we're just going to decrease the volume a little bit, they said, and then go off of pain.
[00:51:59] Abby Jorgensen: Yeah.
[00:52:03] Abby Jorgensen: So, yeah, get them, hopefully get them back in the swing of things.
[00:52:10] Gerard Donnelly: Have you got the right session there, Abby?
[00:52:18] Gerard Donnelly: That's not a bad session.
[00:52:20] Gerard Donnelly: Yeah, I guess I didn't want like the super high intensity session for him.
[00:52:24] Abby Jorgensen: No, that's okay.
[00:52:28] Gerard Donnelly: I can't remember you even writing that session so long ago since I've ever used it.
[00:52:32] Gerard Donnelly: That's okay.
[00:52:34] Gerard Donnelly: Yep.
[00:52:36] Gerard Donnelly: All right.
[00:52:38] Gerard Donnelly: Philippe?
[00:52:41] Abby Jorgensen: I mean, as good as you can ask for from, he, I think he did another, did he test last week or is that two weeks ago?
[00:52:51] Abby Jorgensen: God, I can't remember.
[00:52:52] Abby Jorgensen: holiday.
[00:52:53] Abby Jorgensen: Second of January.
[00:52:54] Gerard Donnelly: Second of January.
[00:52:55] Gerard Donnelly: Let show you.
[00:52:55] Gerard Donnelly: Yeah, he tested last week.
[00:52:58] Gerard Donnelly: Oh.
[00:52:59] Gerard Donnelly: All right.
[00:53:00] Gerard Donnelly: Crap, 283, well done.
[00:53:03] Gerard Donnelly: Can you make any comments?
[00:53:08] Gerard Donnelly: He makes comments on everything else.
[00:53:10] Abby Jorgensen: He might have just messaged me.
[00:53:13] Abby Jorgensen: He needs to do the warm-up better.
[00:53:15] Gerard Donnelly: He did it.
[00:53:16] Abby Jorgensen: Like, look, he accidentally did it.
[00:53:20] Abby Jorgensen: Fair enough.
[00:53:22] Abby Jorgensen: Yeah, those things I look at straight away.
[00:53:26] Gerard Donnelly: That's great.
[00:53:28] Gerard Donnelly: No problem.
[00:53:30] Gerard Donnelly: Yeah.
[00:53:32] Gerard Donnelly: So he's skiing.
[00:53:35] Gerard Donnelly: It's really well done.
[00:53:37] Gerard Donnelly: New FTP.
[00:53:38] Gerard Donnelly: He's just breaking all grounds.
[00:53:40] Gerard Donnelly: Yeah, and he's, like, excited to train.
[00:53:42] Abby Jorgensen: Like, he's loving every minute.
[00:53:45] Abby Jorgensen: That's sort of thing Coco needs to hear.
[00:53:47] Gerard Donnelly: Look at this.
[00:53:48] Gerard Donnelly: Look at this.
[00:53:49] Gerard Donnelly: To 50, 60, 70, 80.
[00:53:51] Gerard Donnelly: He just goes up in 10 watts every week, I think, every month.
[00:53:58] Gerard Donnelly: Did he run?
[00:53:58] Gerard Donnelly: problem.
[00:53:59] Gerard Donnelly: Let's
[00:54:00] Abby Jorgensen: Uh, we did, he did a progressive run.
[00:54:02] Abby Jorgensen: He was going to do it on the treadmill, but then he ended up just going outside.
[00:54:07] Abby Jorgensen: And cause he, he sent me a picture.
[00:54:10] Abby Jorgensen: was like all icy.
[00:54:12] Abby Jorgensen: And then I was like, you went outside and he's like, well, there was a little bit of ice.
[00:54:15] Abby Jorgensen: So I just slowed down a little bit.
[00:54:17] Abby Jorgensen: Yeah.
[00:54:18] Abby Jorgensen: But where is he?
[00:54:21] Abby Jorgensen: Canada somewhere.
[00:54:22] Abby Jorgensen: I don't know.
[00:54:24] Abby Jorgensen: Me neither.
[00:54:25] Abby Jorgensen: Uh, yeah.
[00:54:26] Abby Jorgensen: I never understand.
[00:54:27] Abby Jorgensen: don't.
[00:54:27] Abby Jorgensen: Montreal.
[00:54:28] Abby Jorgensen: I think that's, is that?
[00:54:32] Abby Jorgensen: I can't remember.
[00:54:34] Abby Jorgensen: Cause Vancouver's west.
[00:54:37] Abby Jorgensen: Yeah.
[00:54:37] Abby Jorgensen: It's in the east.
[00:54:38] Gerard Donnelly: East.
[00:54:39] Gerard Donnelly: Okay.
[00:54:39] Abby Jorgensen: Then Toronto is in the center.
[00:54:41] Abby Jorgensen: Yeah.
[00:54:42] Abby Jorgensen: So it's neck.
[00:54:42] Gerard Donnelly: It's not far from Toronto.
[00:54:44] Gerard Donnelly: Okay.
[00:54:52] Gerard Donnelly: There's Montreal.
[00:54:53] Gerard Donnelly: There's Ottawa.
[00:54:55] Gerard Donnelly: then, you know, the other side of the country has got it.
[00:55:01] Abby Jorgensen: You know, British Columbia.
[00:55:04] Gerard Donnelly: Okay.
[00:55:06] Abby Jorgensen: Geography lesson.
[00:55:10] Abby Jorgensen: You've got to remember all that.
[00:55:12] Abby Jorgensen: There's Vancouver.
[00:55:13] Gerard Donnelly: So it's completely the other side.
[00:55:15] Gerard Donnelly: Vancouver's there.
[00:55:17] Gerard Donnelly: And Montreal and...
[00:55:18] Gerard Donnelly: Ottawa.
[00:55:19] Gerard Donnelly: Toronto and Ottawa are there on the East Coast.
[00:55:26] Gerard Donnelly: I catch Beecher who lives in Montreal and...
[00:55:30] Gerard Donnelly: It's freezing.
[00:55:31] Gerard Donnelly: Yeah.
[00:55:32] Abby Jorgensen: I mean, he always complains that it's cold and I'm always like, same here.
[00:55:37] Abby Jorgensen: Well, Beecher just doesn't go outside at all.
[00:55:39] Gerard Donnelly: He just trains all indoor at this moment.
[00:55:43] Gerard Donnelly: I mean, I used to be that way.
[00:55:45] Abby Jorgensen: I'm not usually a cold winter runner, but you've made me go outside.
[00:55:50] Abby Jorgensen: Yeah.
[00:55:54] Gerard Donnelly: So is he running okay?
[00:55:57] Abby Jorgensen: Yeah.
[00:55:57] Abby Jorgensen: I mean, his runs of...
[00:55:59] Abby Jorgensen: of...
[00:55:59] Abby Jorgensen: my...
[00:55:59] Abby Jorgensen: Is he running worse.
[00:55:59] Abby Jorgensen: I'm been
[00:56:00] Abby Jorgensen: Ben, he's just doing, he has a, I think he has a half marathon soon.
[00:56:07] Abby Jorgensen: Was that him that I was, maybe not soon, but, well, there.
[00:56:13] Abby Jorgensen: Yeah, April.
[00:56:18] Gerard Donnelly: Yeah, but I'd still, I'd still push for him to do sometime a 5K on the treadmill.
[00:56:23] Gerard Donnelly: 5K on treadmill, okay.
[00:56:25] Abby Jorgensen: Yeah.
[00:56:29] Gerard Donnelly: So, yeah, whether you did, so how many runs have got this week?
[00:56:34] Gerard Donnelly: So it's indoor, he's missed, oh, he could still be doing that, couldn't he?
[00:56:38] Abby Jorgensen: Yeah, he usually gets, he rarely misses sessions, so.
[00:56:46] Gerard Donnelly: You could get him to run a hard 5K there, if you wanted off the bike, that would be good.
[00:56:51] Gerard Donnelly: Okay.
[00:56:52] Abby Jorgensen: It's still around the same time.
[00:56:54] Gerard Donnelly: Yeah, it's true.
[00:56:56] Abby Jorgensen: Okay.
[00:56:57] Gerard Donnelly: Aaron, are you still on track?
[00:57:00] Gerard Donnelly: Yep.
[00:57:01] Abby Jorgensen: She was supposed to be there for four weeks.
[00:57:05] Abby Jorgensen: I mean, she's getting stuff in, mostly runs and swimming, and then a lot of walking, a lot of tourist stuff, looks like and sounds like.
[00:57:17] Abby Jorgensen: Is she traveling or is she just...
[00:57:22] Abby Jorgensen: I don't know.
[00:57:26] Abby Jorgensen: Looks like she's...
[00:57:28] Gerard Donnelly: Yeah, no, she's not far from Sydney.
[00:57:31] Gerard Donnelly: Yeah, I think that's where her family's from.
[00:57:33] Gerard Donnelly: Yep, so if she's not traveling, get her to go to a gym.
[00:57:38] Gerard Donnelly: Tell her to pull her finger out.
[00:57:41] Gerard Donnelly: Every gym has a bike.
[00:57:42] Abby Jorgensen: Every gym has a bike.
[00:57:44] Abby Jorgensen: It does.
[00:57:45] Abby Jorgensen: It's just so slack.
[00:57:47] Abby Jorgensen: Yeah.
[00:57:51] Gerard Donnelly: I'm happy with just the rides, running and swimming.
[00:57:54] Gerard Donnelly: But if she's going to miss the runs, that's not good.
[00:57:59] Gerard Donnelly: You know, she's...
[00:58:00] Gerard Donnelly: Missed two runs.
[00:58:01] Gerard Donnelly: So anyway, see what you can do there.
[00:58:05] Abby Jorgensen: You're giving them those indoor gyms.
[00:58:06] Gerard Donnelly: And so a lot of the time, Abby, I'd give them the shorter, you know, the RPE shorter ones like I've got, sorry, I've got this Hotel 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, and they're really short 40 minute efforts.
[00:58:27] Gerard Donnelly: It's, they're quite good to do.
[00:58:31] Gerard Donnelly: Have you got access to them?
[00:58:32] Gerard Donnelly: Yeah, I think so.
[00:58:34] Abby Jorgensen: Yeah.
[00:58:38] Gerard Donnelly: Yeah, so, I don't know.
[00:58:40] Gerard Donnelly: Chuck a few in there with Swim.
[00:58:42] Gerard Donnelly: I'll just chuck them in for you.
[00:58:46] Gerard Donnelly: And just text the same, you know, you don't get on the bike and you're not doing all the runs.
[00:58:53] Gerard Donnelly: This is a great opportunity.
[00:58:55] Gerard Donnelly: You're on freaking holidays.
[00:58:56] Gerard Donnelly: Alright.
[00:58:59] Gerard Donnelly: Thanks.
[00:59:00] Gerard Donnelly: All right.
[00:59:05] Gerard Donnelly: Raleigh?
[00:59:06] Gerard Donnelly: No, he got the flu last week.
[00:59:09] Abby Jorgensen: So I know.
[00:59:15] Abby Jorgensen: So he's probably not going to do this race coming up, is he obviously?
[00:59:21] Abby Jorgensen: So I have a few like lower intensity sessions to start the week because he was feeling better today.
[00:59:29] Abby Jorgensen: But I don't want to jump quite yet.
[00:59:33] Abby Jorgensen: just cut down the intensity?
[00:59:36] Gerard Donnelly: Yeah.
[00:59:38] Abby Jorgensen: I just picked that reduced intensity one.
[00:59:41] Abby Jorgensen: Yeah, good.
[00:59:42] Gerard Donnelly: Yeah.
[00:59:43] Gerard Donnelly: Well done.
[00:59:45] Abby Jorgensen: And then I'll see how he feels Wednesday before I decide on Thursday or not.
[00:59:50] Abby Jorgensen: Yeah.
[00:59:52] Abby Jorgensen: But yeah, I threw in the Ironman stuff just so I had a calendar in my head.
[00:59:58] Abby Jorgensen: Yeah, good.
[00:59:59] Abby Jorgensen: Good.
[00:59:59] Abby Jorgensen: Good.
[00:59:59] Abby Jorgensen: Good.
[00:59:59] Gerard Donnelly: Good.
[00:59:59] Gerard Donnelly: Good.
[00:59:59] Gerard Donnelly: Good.
[00:59:59] Gerard Donnelly: Good.
[01:00:02] Gerard Donnelly: Ironman, Texas has only got 100 spots left.
[01:00:04] Gerard Donnelly: I got an email today.
[01:00:06] Gerard Donnelly: Not really.
[01:00:06] Abby Jorgensen: I think Chattanooga sold out.
[01:00:09] Abby Jorgensen: I got that today, I thought.
[01:00:12] Abby Jorgensen: Or maybe 70.3 did.
[01:00:13] Abby Jorgensen: I don't know.
[01:00:16] Abby Jorgensen: Peter?
[01:00:18] Abby Jorgensen: He did the run and swim.
[01:00:19] Abby Jorgensen: His watch just doesn't sync right.
[01:00:21] Abby Jorgensen: I just texted him today.
[01:00:23] Abby Jorgensen: Um, he, I mean, he's getting back into the swing of things.
[01:00:37] Abby Jorgensen: He failed the FTP.
[01:00:39] Abby Jorgensen: Like, so, I even had a, he even knew, like, he even texted me before.
[01:00:44] Abby Jorgensen: He's like, I know, I can't expect my FTP to be what it, what it was.
[01:00:50] Abby Jorgensen: And I don't know why he didn't finish it.
[01:00:53] Abby Jorgensen: I think he just gets in that headspace of.
[01:00:57] Gerard Donnelly: This is what I should do.
[01:00:59] Abby Jorgensen: Yeah.
[01:01:00] Abby Jorgensen: Yeah.
[01:01:00] Abby Jorgensen: And he knew, like, he even told me, he's like, I know, I can't expect my FTP to be the same.
[01:01:06] Abby Jorgensen: I'm like, then why?
[01:01:08] Abby Jorgensen: Yeah.
[01:01:09] Abby Jorgensen: Why not just join?
[01:01:11] Abby Jorgensen: Abby, he needs to do it again.
[01:01:15] Abby Jorgensen: Yeah.
[01:01:15] Abby Jorgensen: Yeah.
[01:01:20] Abby Jorgensen: Why does his stuff look so smooth?
[01:01:28] Abby Jorgensen: Yeah, I'm not, that's okay.
[01:01:30] Abby Jorgensen: Okay.
[01:01:31] Gerard Donnelly: I mean, he's not finished it, so he has to learn this lesson.
[01:01:40] Gerard Donnelly: He only had 14 minutes.
[01:01:42] Gerard Donnelly: I had two guys last week do exactly the same.
[01:01:45] Gerard Donnelly: One guy did 10 minutes, the other guy did 12.
[01:01:47] Gerard Donnelly: And I just said, you know, you have to do it again.
[01:01:53] Gerard Donnelly: And understand where your numbers are, start more conservatively.
[01:01:58] Gerard Donnelly: So.
[01:01:59] Gerard Donnelly: So.
[01:01:59] Gerard Donnelly: Yeah.
[01:02:00] Gerard Donnelly: So, you know, he started at 290 something, 295, and I know his last test in August was 308, so, you know, in May he did 294.
[01:02:14] Gerard Donnelly: So, you know, he has to start at 270.
[01:02:17] Gerard Donnelly: He hasn't trained properly for a month, has he?
[01:02:20] Gerard Donnelly: No, not since me.
[01:02:22] Abby Jorgensen: He hasn't trained really properly since Marbello.
[01:02:25] Gerard Donnelly: So tell him 270, you're going to start there.
[01:02:29] Gerard Donnelly: And we're going to do it again.
[01:02:30] Gerard Donnelly: But Gerard and I have spoken.
[01:02:32] Gerard Donnelly: We think 270 is a good starting point.
[01:02:35] Gerard Donnelly: You are able to do, you're able to do 290 for six minutes, seven minutes, and then you couldn't go anymore.
[01:02:45] Gerard Donnelly: So your next, your next two minutes was 284, and your next two minutes was 275.
[01:02:54] Gerard Donnelly: So, start there.
[01:02:57] Abby Jorgensen: 275.
[01:02:58] Abby Jorgensen: 275.
[01:02:59] Abby Jorgensen: 21.
[01:03:01] Gerard Donnelly: And get him to do it instead of that session, text him and say, you've talked to me, get him to do it here.
[01:03:07] Gerard Donnelly: We can't, he can't train accurately with what we're going to do.
[01:03:15] Abby Jorgensen: Yeah, that's what I, I told him like, if anything, like we're, you only get a week and then we're redoing it.
[01:03:24] Gerard Donnelly: Yeah, no, tell him you talk, Gerard's overridden you, put me under the bus, okay?
[01:03:31] Gerard Donnelly: Yeah, I mean, I told him I would probably talk to you and.
[01:03:33] Gerard Donnelly: Yeah, yeah, and, and we have to learn the lesson.
[01:03:37] Abby Jorgensen: Yeah.
[01:03:39] Gerard Donnelly: You agreed with me, but you started literally 10 watts lower, you know, you, that just, we've learned something that 10 watts after eight weeks is too, it's not enough.
[01:03:51] Gerard Donnelly: You know, you should have started 30 watts lower.
[01:03:55] Gerard Donnelly: That's how quickly fitness drops off.
[01:03:56] Gerard Donnelly: That's, they're the things we tell people all the time.
[01:04:01] Gerard Donnelly: If he starts at 270, Abby, he could end up at 305 at the end, you know, which means you'll end up with a 290 something.
[01:04:10] Gerard Donnelly: But trust us, you know, that has to be done that way.
[01:04:14] Gerard Donnelly: Do you run?
[01:04:18] Abby Jorgensen: No, just because he hasn't been running much, so I didn't want to put him.
[01:04:22] Abby Jorgensen: That's really sensible.
[01:04:23] Gerard Donnelly: He hasn't run at all last week, as he did, 130 minutes.
[01:04:26] Gerard Donnelly: Yeah, I just didn't want to put him in that position.
[01:04:29] Abby Jorgensen: No, you're right.
[01:04:31] Abby Jorgensen: But we need to get him running.
[01:04:32] Abby Jorgensen: Yeah.
[01:04:33] Gerard Donnelly: So we've done a 40-minute there.
[01:04:37] Gerard Donnelly: 5 by 2, that's great.
[01:04:39] Gerard Donnelly: I would probably just give him a couple of runs, like, without any hill repeats, Abby.
[01:04:43] Gerard Donnelly: Okay.
[01:04:45] Abby Jorgensen: I'd change that just to another.
[01:04:47] Gerard Donnelly: Tell him, we're going to get your intensity from the bike, and we're going to just get you running again.
[01:04:51] Gerard Donnelly: Okay.
[01:04:52] Gerard Donnelly: Because if you looked at what's he run?
[01:04:54] Gerard Donnelly: He's running 17k, 11k.
[01:04:59] Gerard Donnelly: Bye.
[01:04:59] Gerard Donnelly: Bye.
[01:05:01] Gerard Donnelly: No K, 17, 15, 11, 4.
[01:05:12] Gerard Donnelly: So, you know, since the race, he hasn't run more than 17K.
[01:05:17] Gerard Donnelly: So let's not do any heel repeats yet.
[01:05:20] Gerard Donnelly: Let's just do endurance, endurance, run off the bike and endurance.
[01:05:25] Abby Jorgensen: That could be too long, Abby.
[01:05:28] Gerard Donnelly: Okay.
[01:05:28] Gerard Donnelly: I was debating in my head what.
[01:05:31] Abby Jorgensen: I would say 50 minutes.
[01:05:33] Gerard Donnelly: give him 40 minutes like you have, 40 minutes there, 30 minutes there, and 50 minutes there.
[01:05:42] Gerard Donnelly: And if you want to, if you feel like he's got more time, give him another coffee right here.
[01:05:48] Gerard Donnelly: Like if the weather's fine, wherever he is.
[01:05:55] Abby Jorgensen: 40s and 50s.
[01:05:56] Gerard Donnelly: Yeah, just give him an indoor recovery ride.
[01:05:59] Gerard Donnelly: Click.
[01:06:00] Gerard Donnelly: That's the run.
[01:06:06] Gerard Donnelly: Where is he now?
[01:06:07] Gerard Donnelly: He's on the East Coast, isn't he?
[01:06:09] Gerard Donnelly: Yeah, North Carolina.
[01:06:13] Abby Jorgensen: It's pretty hot there, isn't it?
[01:06:15] Gerard Donnelly: Not right now, like 40s.
[01:06:17] Abby Jorgensen: I don't mean hot.
[01:06:18] Abby Jorgensen: I mean, not snowing.
[01:06:21] Abby Jorgensen: Not snowing.
[01:06:22] Abby Jorgensen: Yeah, they might get some in the mountains, but.
[01:06:26] Abby Jorgensen: I'm just trying to see.
[01:06:29] Gerard Donnelly: What level are you?
[01:06:31] Gerard Donnelly: Where are you?
[01:06:33] Gerard Donnelly: Right in the middle.
[01:06:35] Abby Jorgensen: Here?
[01:06:35] Abby Jorgensen: No, Iowa.
[01:06:38] Abby Jorgensen: Iowa, here.
[01:06:39] Abby Jorgensen: Yeah.
[01:06:40] Abby Jorgensen: Yep.
[01:06:40] Gerard Donnelly: So he's a fair bit lower.
[01:06:44] Abby Jorgensen: Yeah, but yeah, it just depends.
[01:06:48] Abby Jorgensen: Yeah.
[01:06:50] Gerard Donnelly: I coach Pilar and he's here.
[01:06:54] Gerard Donnelly: And it's not much lower than there.
[01:06:58] Gerard Donnelly: You're, you're significantly.
[01:07:00] Gerard Donnelly: We're up here.
[01:07:01] Abby Jorgensen: Yeah, we're.
[01:07:04] Gerard Donnelly: So it should be fine.
[01:07:06] Gerard Donnelly: Should be.
[01:07:09] Abby Jorgensen: All right.
[01:07:10] Gerard Donnelly: You're going to have to manage that one with him.
[01:07:13] Gerard Donnelly: Yeah.
[01:07:14] Abby Jorgensen: Peter's always a challenge, I think.
[01:07:16] Abby Jorgensen: He is.
[01:07:17] Gerard Donnelly: And just keep using me all the time.
[01:07:20] Gerard Donnelly: Okay.
[01:07:22] Gerard Donnelly: I don't want you to undermine yourself.
[01:07:24] Gerard Donnelly: That's not what I'm saying.
[01:07:25] Abby Jorgensen: I think he's, he really does trust me now, but I think when I tell him, like, that I've talked to you, he does feel.
[01:07:33] Abby Jorgensen: Yeah.
[01:07:34] Gerard Donnelly: We shouldn't have to do that, but.
[01:07:36] Gerard Donnelly: Yeah.
[01:07:39] Gerard Donnelly: I don't want to undermine your status.
[01:07:43] Gerard Donnelly: The way you phrase it, you know, I've had another conversation with Gerard and he agrees with me, you.
[01:07:49] Gerard Donnelly: Yeah.
[01:07:50] Abby Jorgensen: That we need to do it again.
[01:07:54] Gerard Donnelly: And talk about the lesson learned, you know, that when you take time off.
[01:08:00] Gerard Donnelly: You know, we have to be super conservative, way more than you think.
[01:08:06] Gerard Donnelly: All right, Gann?
[01:08:09] Gerard Donnelly: He's going good, I believe.
[01:08:12] Gerard Donnelly: Went two of his bucket.
[01:08:17] Gerard Donnelly: Great.
[01:08:18] Gerard Donnelly: Yeah.
[01:08:20] Abby Jorgensen: Yeah.
[01:08:24] Gerard Donnelly: Okay, Gann?
[01:08:25] Abby Jorgensen: Gann, feel like she's just going to be a lost cause until she gets back to Australia.
[01:08:29] Abby Jorgensen: Yeah.
[01:08:29] Abby Jorgensen: And then she's a lost cause in Australia.
[01:08:31] Abby Jorgensen: Maybe.
[01:08:32] Abby Jorgensen: Who knows at this point?
[01:08:34] Abby Jorgensen: Yeah.
[01:08:34] Abby Jorgensen: I mean, she's doing stuff, but not like anything that I try to put stuff in.
[01:08:41] Abby Jorgensen: She's doing stuff.
[01:08:42] Abby Jorgensen: She's just going to the gym, I think, and going.
[01:08:46] Abby Jorgensen: Yeah.
[01:08:48] Abby Jorgensen: Spinning.
[01:08:48] Gerard Donnelly: Does that mean she's spinning on the bike, does she?
[01:08:52] Gerard Donnelly: Oh, can't.
[01:08:53] Gerard Donnelly: There's nothing there.
[01:08:56] Abby Jorgensen: Nothing like it.
[01:08:57] Abby Jorgensen: Enters it from, like, her watch.
[01:09:00] Abby Jorgensen: Sure.
[01:09:01] Abby Jorgensen: Can't.
[01:09:01] Abby Jorgensen: It's the same thing every day.
[01:09:03] Abby Jorgensen: Yeah.
[01:09:03] Gerard Donnelly: Just say to her, listen, you need to upload whatever you're doing.
[01:09:09] Gerard Donnelly: I'm sure you've told her that.
[01:09:11] Abby Jorgensen: Yeah.
[01:09:12] Abby Jorgensen: She's definitely different than her mom.
[01:09:16] Abby Jorgensen: This is a waste of time.
[01:09:20] Gerard Donnelly: I can't even look at it.
[01:09:22] Abby Jorgensen: Yeah.
[01:09:22] Abby Jorgensen: I sometimes just try to forget about it.
[01:09:26] Gerard Donnelly: Bill, William.
[01:09:29] Gerard Donnelly: He's doing good.
[01:09:30] Abby Jorgensen: He's in the groove.
[01:09:32] Abby Jorgensen: He's found his groove and he's enjoying it again.
[01:09:36] Abby Jorgensen: Fantastic.
[01:09:40] Gerard Donnelly: Albert.
[01:09:42] Gerard Donnelly: Also just, yeah, checking off the boxes.
[01:09:46] Gerard Donnelly: Last week of his block.
[01:09:48] Gerard Donnelly: Yep.
[01:09:49] Abby Jorgensen: Yep.
[01:09:50] Gerard Donnelly: So he's getting enough running in.
[01:09:53] Abby Jorgensen: Yeah, think, um, schedule, I think.
[01:09:57] Gerard Donnelly: 22.
[01:09:58] Gerard Donnelly: He needs a little bit more, doesn't he?
[01:10:00] Gerard Donnelly: Eventually, yeah.
[01:10:02] Abby Jorgensen: mean, he's kind of...
[01:10:06] Gerard Donnelly: With his work schedule.
[01:10:08] Gerard Donnelly: Yeah.
[01:10:10] Abby Jorgensen: I mean, still...
[01:10:10] Abby Jorgensen: Is there still four runs?
[01:10:12] Abby Jorgensen: One, two...
[01:10:13] Abby Jorgensen: Yeah, he still has four runs in there.
[01:10:15] Gerard Donnelly: Everybody misses this one, don't they?
[01:10:17] Gerard Donnelly: Well, I mean, it's still...
[01:10:19] Abby Jorgensen: Oh, yeah, sorry.
[01:10:21] Gerard Donnelly: Yeah.
[01:10:23] Abby Jorgensen: It's still Monday here.
[01:10:25] Abby Jorgensen: He's only an hour ahead of me, so it's only...
[01:10:27] Abby Jorgensen: Yeah, 3.30.
[01:10:29] Abby Jorgensen: Yeah.
[01:10:30] Gerard Donnelly: 4.30.
[01:10:31] Gerard Donnelly: Okay.
[01:10:33] Gerard Donnelly: Karen's mum, everything all right there, or is she...
[01:10:36] Abby Jorgensen: She's back on track this week.
[01:10:39] Abby Jorgensen: Fantastic.
[01:10:40] Abby Jorgensen: She did fall on a run and, like, hit her eye, so...
[01:10:45] Abby Jorgensen: Jesus.
[01:10:46] Abby Jorgensen: We took a break from swimming, so I didn't want her to put her goggles on her bruised eye, obviously.
[01:10:55] Abby Jorgensen: Yeah, that's great.
[01:10:58] Abby Jorgensen: Went for a run with my daughter.
[01:10:59] Abby Jorgensen: Yeah.
[01:11:00] Abby Jorgensen: Yeah, which I was like, well, then why didn't Jen, like, upload anything?
[01:11:04] Abby Jorgensen: I'm like, unless it's a different daughter.
[01:11:06] Abby Jorgensen: I know she has a couple.
[01:11:08] Gerard Donnelly: When did you get busy?
[01:11:12] Gerard Donnelly: If she's got access to a blood pressure machine, get her to take the blood pressure, Abby.
[01:11:20] Gerard Donnelly: Well, I'd like to know if it's 120 over 80 or 100 over 60.
[01:11:28] Gerard Donnelly: Yeah.
[01:11:32] Abby Jorgensen: You would think with her parents, she'd probably have – she said she might at one point have to go help, like, relieve her sister that's taking care of them and stuff, but I told her we'd, you obviously work with her, but she's – Dizziness is a bit of a worry.
[01:11:47] Abby Jorgensen: Yeah.
[01:11:48] Gerard Donnelly: That would be low blood pressure.
[01:11:49] Gerard Donnelly: And the easy way to measure is just go and get a – I mean, I have to do it every day with my heart condition now.
[01:11:57] Gerard Donnelly: Because I get dizzy every time I stand up now.
[01:11:59] Gerard Donnelly: Absolutely.
[01:11:59] Gerard Donnelly: Thank Age That's
[01:12:00] Gerard Donnelly: Which, you know, I'm on medication because I'm on so much blood thinners, it's affecting my busyness.
[01:12:09] Gerard Donnelly: So, yeah, just find out about that.
[01:12:11] Gerard Donnelly: That's great.
[01:12:11] Gerard Donnelly: She's done a whole week of training.
[01:12:13] Gerard Donnelly: Fantastic.
[01:12:14] Abby Jorgensen: Yeah.
[01:12:15] Gerard Donnelly: Got it, boy?
[01:12:17] Gerard Donnelly: He's doing good as well.
[01:12:20] Abby Jorgensen: Flies into Boston tonight, I believe.
[01:12:24] Abby Jorgensen: So we had the issues where he was doing more than he should have, wasn't it?
[01:12:28] Gerard Donnelly: Yep.
[01:12:29] Gerard Donnelly: Yep.
[01:12:30] Gerard Donnelly: He was just training too hard.
[01:12:32] Gerard Donnelly: Are we getting on, is he, I'm just, like he's, that was.
[01:12:38] Abby Jorgensen: Yeah, so we talked through, and I think what it is, he has that swift cog on.
[01:12:44] Abby Jorgensen: Yeah.
[01:12:45] Abby Jorgensen: So there's that delay in the, whatever.
[01:12:49] Abby Jorgensen: I've had a couple other people say the same thing that had that at first.
[01:12:54] Abby Jorgensen: So he's going to switch back to the cassette.
[01:12:58] Abby Jorgensen: yeah.
[01:12:59] Abby Jorgensen: Yeah.
[01:12:59] Abby Jorgensen: Or he's going to switch.
[01:13:00] Abby Jorgensen: She has the snap, the wheel on one, and he has a core.
[01:13:05] Abby Jorgensen: So he's going to experiment and see which one does better for him.
[01:13:13] Abby Jorgensen: But we'll work through it.
[01:13:15] Abby Jorgensen: And then that one.
[01:13:34] Gerard Donnelly: Is FTP 40, Abby?
[01:13:40] Abby Jorgensen: Oh, the easy.
[01:13:42] Abby Jorgensen: Yeah.
[01:13:43] Abby Jorgensen: Okay.
[01:13:44] Abby Jorgensen: Yeah.
[01:13:44] Gerard Donnelly: Tell him to ride more power.
[01:13:48] Abby Jorgensen: That's what I told him.
[01:13:48] Abby Jorgensen: I'm like, it's okay to ride more than, like, it just has to be easy.
[01:13:54] Abby Jorgensen: We don't want to accumulate too much.
[01:13:56] Abby Jorgensen: But I was like, yeah, sometimes that first FTP too might.
[01:14:00] Abby Jorgensen: Predict it a little lower and your FTP is probably higher.
[01:14:04] Abby Jorgensen: So eventually get to that point.
[01:14:07] Gerard Donnelly: Now, this question, did you?
[01:14:11] Gerard Donnelly: Yeah, I answered that.
[01:14:13] Gerard Donnelly: Now, you should say to him, hey, all the aims and goals of the VO2 are in the videos in the membership site.
[01:14:20] Gerard Donnelly: Okay.
[01:14:22] Gerard Donnelly: Fresh old VO2, endurance run, endurance ride.
[01:14:26] Gerard Donnelly: And say to him, you know, this is part of your training is to watch the videos.
[01:14:34] Gerard Donnelly: Can you remind him about that?
[01:14:36] Gerard Donnelly: Yeah.
[01:14:37] Gerard Donnelly: It's great that he's asking questions.
[01:14:39] Gerard Donnelly: That's what you want to know.
[01:14:39] Gerard Donnelly: And you're able to answer it, obviously.
[01:14:42] Abby Jorgensen: Yeah, that was a quick one.
[01:14:45] Gerard Donnelly: But that points out to me because that is in the video that he's not watching it.
[01:14:51] Abby Jorgensen: And he's only new, so.
[01:14:53] Abby Jorgensen: Yeah.
[01:14:53] Abby Jorgensen: I think he said he's trying to get, he's watched some of them.
[01:14:57] Abby Jorgensen: Just, there's a lot.
[01:14:58] Abby Jorgensen: I was like, yes, there's.
[01:15:00] Abby Jorgensen: Yeah, okay.
[01:15:00] Abby Jorgensen: Well, that's good.
[01:15:01] Abby Jorgensen: But yeah, he's enjoying it.
[01:15:09] Abby Jorgensen: Good.
[01:15:13] Gerard Donnelly: So he's away.
[01:15:15] Abby Jorgensen: Yeah, he's in Boston.
[01:15:16] Abby Jorgensen: Yep.
[01:15:16] Gerard Donnelly: Yep, so that'll be all right.
[01:15:20] Gerard Donnelly: Yeah.
[01:15:22] Abby Jorgensen: He sent me, like, his whole race thing, so.
[01:15:29] Gerard Donnelly: Yep, good.
[01:15:31] Gerard Donnelly: All right.
[01:15:32] Gerard Donnelly: Anything else, Abby?
[01:15:35] Gerard Donnelly: No, I think that's it.
[01:15:37] Abby Jorgensen: The biggest ones was, you know, Coco and.
[01:15:39] Abby Jorgensen: Yep.
[01:15:42] Gerard Donnelly: Yep, well, with any of those, just yell out to me today or the rest of the day when you get back to them.
[01:15:52] Gerard Donnelly: I might send Coco a Happy New Year text saying, Happy New Year, great to see you training the house down.
[01:16:00] Gerard Donnelly: I'm looking forward to measuring your progress this week.
[01:16:06] Gerard Donnelly: What do you think?
[01:16:07] Gerard Donnelly: Yeah.
[01:16:11] Abby Jorgensen: It's kind of innocent.
[01:16:13] Abby Jorgensen: It is.
[01:16:13] Abby Jorgensen: It's a sneaky backwards way.
[01:16:16] Abby Jorgensen: Yeah.
[01:16:17] Gerard Donnelly: I could mention the weather looks better towards the end of the week, so the wind won't be as strong.
[01:16:22] Gerard Donnelly: Yeah.
[01:16:23] Abby Jorgensen: What do you think?
[01:16:25] Abby Jorgensen: Yeah.
[01:16:25] Abby Jorgensen: Is that interfering?
[01:16:27] Gerard Donnelly: No.
[01:16:28] Abby Jorgensen: Well, because I'll just message her later and talk to her.
[01:16:35] Gerard Donnelly: I can also say, hey, thanks for the card.
[01:16:38] Gerard Donnelly: Yeah.
[01:16:39] Abby Jorgensen: That's how I should start, actually.
[01:16:46] Gerard Donnelly: I can't type in Coco.
[01:16:47] Gerard Donnelly: It's got to be Karina.
[01:16:49] Gerard Donnelly: Yeah.
[01:16:52] Abby Jorgensen: The new podcast was good.
[01:16:54] Abby Jorgensen: I know you probably didn't listen to it, but.
[01:16:55] Abby Jorgensen: Yeah, I didn't.
[01:16:57] Abby Jorgensen: You don't talk much, so you could have listened to it.
[01:16:59] Abby Jorgensen: Yeah.
[01:16:59] Abby Jorgensen: You
[01:17:00] Abby Jorgensen: Yeah, it's great when I'm not talking much.
[01:17:02] Abby Jorgensen: It's excellent.
[01:17:03] Abby Jorgensen: No, but it's cool to see how cycling and running, it's definitely made me a better runner.
[01:17:12] Abby Jorgensen: Yeah, they just really help each other, don't they?
[01:17:15] Abby Jorgensen: Yeah, I don't know how people can run all that without doing something else.
[01:17:20] Abby Jorgensen: He's an unbelievable runner, Abby.
[01:17:22] Gerard Donnelly: Oh my God.
[01:17:23] Abby Jorgensen: Yeah, some of the paces, even in kilometers, I was like, what?
[01:17:27] Gerard Donnelly: I ran a 61, half marathon, a 101.
[01:17:32] Abby Jorgensen: That's insane.
[01:17:34] Abby Jorgensen: I can't even like fathom, like I have that goal of 140 and I feel like that's still...
[01:17:41] Gerard Donnelly: You just think, how can I be 40 minutes behind someone?
[01:17:44] Gerard Donnelly: 40 minutes.
[01:17:45] Gerard Donnelly: It's nearly, he's finished and I've just gone over halfway.
[01:17:50] Abby Jorgensen: Well, the other day, because we have those assault runner things, treadmills that you have to...
[01:17:56] Abby Jorgensen: Yes, I can.
[01:17:57] Abby Jorgensen: The other day, I was trying to see how fast I can get on it.
[01:18:00] Abby Jorgensen: And, like, I got to, like, a 4.55 mile pace, which, and then you're like, people run that for an entire marathon.
[01:18:09] Gerard Donnelly: Well, there was a treadmill set up in a park, and people were encouraged to see if they could run one kilometer at Chip Kogi's world record at 2.50 kilometer pace, which is.
[01:18:22] Gerard Donnelly: Like four or something.
[01:18:24] Abby Jorgensen: Or a five mile pace or something, 4.10 mile pace.
[01:18:27] Gerard Donnelly: And hardly anybody could last a kilometer.
[01:18:30] Gerard Donnelly: Hardly anybody.
[01:18:32] Gerard Donnelly: I can't even run that fast if I sprinted, I don't think.
[01:18:35] Abby Jorgensen: Like, yeah, well, that's, most people were sprinting.
[01:18:39] Abby Jorgensen: Yeah.
[01:18:39] Gerard Donnelly: And they couldn't sustain the four minutes.
[01:18:48] Gerard Donnelly: Yeah.
[01:18:50] Gerard Donnelly: Yeah.
[01:18:51] Gerard Donnelly: Yeah.
[01:18:53] Gerard Donnelly: Yeah.
[01:18:53] Gerard Donnelly: A bit of a dry personality, but if the content's what's important, rather than I always think it's good.
[01:19:01] Gerard Donnelly: That's good.
[01:19:02] Gerard Donnelly: You enjoyed it.
[01:19:03] Gerard Donnelly: It's our most watched video already.
[01:19:06] Gerard Donnelly: Oh, really?
[01:19:07] Gerard Donnelly: Or on YouTube or like podcast?
[01:19:10] Abby Jorgensen: I just listen to it usually.
[01:19:11] Gerard Donnelly: Yeah, I think Jordan said on, because he's got 40,000 Instagram followers.
[01:19:17] Gerard Donnelly: Oh, okay.
[01:19:18] Gerard Donnelly: That makes sense.
[01:19:19] Gerard Donnelly: That's why it's the most watched.
[01:19:21] Gerard Donnelly: Yeah.
[01:19:22] Gerard Donnelly: And he promoted us in his, and so he should.
[01:19:28] Gerard Donnelly: I don't know if you remember.
[01:19:29] Gerard Donnelly: Well, we actually got him his, we helped get him his other contract as a bike rider.
[01:19:33] Gerard Donnelly: Oh.
[01:19:35] Gerard Donnelly: We interviewed him saying, I think the heading was, give this guy a contract.
[01:19:40] Gerard Donnelly: Because he used to ride for EF education on the pro tour, and then they didn't renew his contract.
[01:19:50] Gerard Donnelly: And so we put a podcast out for him, asking him, what are you going to do with your life?
[01:19:55] Gerard Donnelly: If you don't have a pro contract, what are going to do?
[01:19:58] Gerard Donnelly: He's going, oh, I'm truly trying to get another program.
[01:19:59] Gerard Donnelly: Yeah.
[01:20:00] Gerard Donnelly: So that was our whole premises of the podcast.
[01:20:04] Gerard Donnelly: And next thing you know, he gets a pro-contract.
[01:20:10] Gerard Donnelly: So I think he feels like we really helped him.
[01:20:14] Gerard Donnelly: Yeah.
[01:20:16] Gerard Donnelly: Which we absolutely did.
[01:20:18] Abby Jorgensen: Yeah.
[01:20:19] Abby Jorgensen: That's cool.
[01:20:22] Gerard Donnelly: Good.
[01:20:23] Gerard Donnelly: There hasn't been a lot of people apply from the States.
[01:20:27] Gerard Donnelly: Yeah, it's kind of like that weird time.
[01:20:30] Abby Jorgensen: It is.
[01:20:30] Gerard Donnelly: And sort of following up, there's been one guy, but he applied, but we responded with an email and he hasn't come back with a day and a time.
[01:20:40] Gerard Donnelly: So super frustrating.
[01:20:43] Gerard Donnelly: Yeah.
[01:20:44] Abby Jorgensen: They're the ones who apply.
[01:20:45] Gerard Donnelly: go, why?
[01:20:47] Gerard Donnelly: Why apply if you don't respond?
[01:20:49] Abby Jorgensen: Yeah.
[01:20:49] Gerard Donnelly: The guy's name's Adam Tanvis.
[01:20:52] Gerard Donnelly: Anyway, there's no answer.
[01:20:56] Gerard Donnelly: Oh, no.
[01:20:58] Abby Jorgensen: Well, again.
[01:20:59] Abby Jorgensen: will say.
[01:20:59] Abby Jorgensen: Well,
[01:21:02] Gerard Donnelly: I've even got, in my spreadsheet, I've got Adam Tanvers confirming day and time, and I've got coaching Abby.
[01:21:09] Gerard Donnelly: I haven't even got him yet.
[01:21:11] Gerard Donnelly: I was up to 25, and now I'm back down to 23.
[01:21:15] Abby Jorgensen: I know.
[01:21:16] Abby Jorgensen: Super frustrating.
[01:21:17] Abby Jorgensen: Yeah.
[01:21:19] Abby Jorgensen: Hopefully, the new year will bring out some.
[01:21:22] Abby Jorgensen: Yep.
[01:21:23] Gerard Donnelly: And maybe the podcast normally does as well if we push the podcast.
[01:21:30] Gerard Donnelly: Yeah, I guess you guys take off a little bit over holiday, so.
[01:21:33] Abby Jorgensen: Yep.
[01:21:34] Abby Jorgensen: And I was joking with Jordan, because he asked me what I did for New Year's.
[01:21:37] Abby Jorgensen: I'm like, I think I was in bed by nine.
[01:21:41] Abby Jorgensen: And Jordan's like, I was at a festival, and I was like, of course you were.
[01:21:46] Abby Jorgensen: Like, I think every time there's something, there's a festival, and Jordan's at it.
[01:21:51] Gerard Donnelly: I totally agree.
[01:21:52] Gerard Donnelly: Well, we were babysitting his brother's children, so we were in bed by 10.
[01:21:58] Gerard Donnelly: Yeah.
[01:22:00] Abby Jorgensen: Yeah, it wasn't like, I don't know the, you probably, do have Netflix there?
[01:22:05] Abby Jorgensen: What do you guys do?
[01:22:08] Gerard Donnelly: No, we normally, the tradition is people would go to the local fireworks and have a New Year's party and then watch the fireworks at 12.
[01:22:21] Gerard Donnelly: That's huge in Australia, the fireworks.
[01:22:25] Gerard Donnelly: Um, so where we were, because we were away together, there's 14 of us, so three quarters of the people went to the fireworks and we stayed home with the little kids, um, to babysit, so, which suited me, fine.
[01:22:42] Gerard Donnelly: Yeah.
[01:22:43] Abby Jorgensen: Well, I tried to stay up, I couldn't.
[01:22:46] Abby Jorgensen: No.
[01:22:47] Abby Jorgensen: I can't remember the last time I saw midnight.
[01:22:50] Abby Jorgensen: No, you might be.
[01:22:53] Gerard Donnelly: All right, well, uh, let's, let's see how you're going this week.
[01:22:58] Gerard Donnelly: Yeah, hopefully it's not.
[01:23:00] Abby Jorgensen: It's cold on Sunday for me.
[01:23:02] Abby Jorgensen: Yeah.
[01:23:03] Abby Jorgensen: Yeah.
[01:23:06] Gerard Donnelly: And, yeah, it's, you know, I really think you've done it.
[01:23:11] Abby Jorgensen: What pace do you think I should start at?
[01:23:14] Abby Jorgensen: 7.40?
[01:23:15] Abby Jorgensen: Or, well, that would be, I don't know, 1.
[01:23:18] Gerard Donnelly: I'll need to get the paces up so I can actually call it properly.
[01:23:25] Abby Jorgensen: Because my best 10K pace is, what, 7?
[01:23:28] Abby Jorgensen: It's, like, a 7.27 mile pace.
[01:23:35] Abby Jorgensen: 7.27, okay.
[01:23:36] Gerard Donnelly: So, that's a 46-minute K, 46-minute 10K.
[01:23:46] Abby Jorgensen: Yeah, I think I've come in at, like, 45, 50-something before.
[01:23:54] Abby Jorgensen: I'm just going to look up your spreadsheet.
[01:23:57] Abby Jorgensen: I feel like I'm capable, eventually, of, like, 4.
[01:24:03] Gerard Donnelly: Yeah, you really need to warm up well in these conditions, Abby.
[01:24:08] Abby Jorgensen: Yeah, I might try to warm up here at home a little bit before.
[01:24:15] Gerard Donnelly: What time does it start?
[01:24:16] Gerard Donnelly: Nine.
[01:24:17] Abby Jorgensen: So it's not super early, but.
[01:24:20] Gerard Donnelly: So the last 10K, was that in November?
[01:24:25] Gerard Donnelly: Is that right?
[01:24:26] Gerard Donnelly: The 4610?
[01:24:28] Gerard Donnelly: Yeah.
[01:24:30] Abby Jorgensen: Yeah.
[01:24:30] Abby Jorgensen: Yep.
[01:24:32] Gerard Donnelly: We did the turkey trot on the 22nd, a week later.
[01:24:38] Gerard Donnelly: And we haven't really run one since, have we?
[01:24:41] Gerard Donnelly: Oh, yeah.
[01:24:41] Gerard Donnelly: We did a progressive half.
[01:24:44] Abby Jorgensen: Progressive half.
[01:24:46] Abby Jorgensen: That wasn't a treadmill, was it?
[01:24:48] Abby Jorgensen: Yeah.
[01:24:48] Abby Jorgensen: Yep.
[01:24:49] Gerard Donnelly: I've just changed that to treadmill, so I don't have to ask that question ever again.
[01:24:57] Gerard Donnelly: So that was.
[01:24:58] Gerard Donnelly: So
[01:25:01] Gerard Donnelly: So, I was going to open up Macmillan.
[01:25:07] Abby Jorgensen: I think the course is like slightly downhill on the way out, slightly uphill on the way back, and slightly, I mean, like a 1% grade.
[01:25:21] Abby Jorgensen: Yeah.
[01:25:22] Abby Jorgensen: But.
[01:25:25] Gerard Donnelly: Well, that's good for you not to run out too hard and come out of school.
[01:25:32] Gerard Donnelly: So 4.37 pace is 7.26, is that right?
[01:25:40] Gerard Donnelly: Yeah, that's about right.
[01:25:43] Abby Jorgensen: So that's what you did last time.
[01:25:46] Gerard Donnelly: So if you started at the 7.30 pace and tried to get to the 7.26, 7.25 in the 2nd, 3rd K.
[01:26:00] Gerard Donnelly: Okay.
[01:26:02] Gerard Donnelly: If you're feeling that that's manageable.
[01:26:09] Gerard Donnelly: Hang on.
[01:26:12] Gerard Donnelly: Too many files opening here.
[01:26:15] Gerard Donnelly: So 426 was 5K, 426.
[01:26:21] Gerard Donnelly: Yep.
[01:26:22] Gerard Donnelly: So you've run, you did that Turkey Triathlon at 426 pace, which is 709 pace.
[01:26:37] Gerard Donnelly: So that's kind of what you want to, if you can start at the 730 pace, then get quickly to 726, and then try and spend the majority of that next downhill anywhere between 726 and 720 pace.
[01:26:55] Gerard Donnelly: And then you're going to have to run harder to hold that pace.
[01:27:00] Gerard Donnelly: It's an uphill.
[01:27:02] Gerard Donnelly: But if you feel good, Abby, it's a training race.
[01:27:10] Gerard Donnelly: Don't be restricted.
[01:27:12] Abby Jorgensen: I'm okay for you to blow up.
[01:27:14] Gerard Donnelly: It's actually okay.
[01:27:17] Gerard Donnelly: So use this as a fun way.
[01:27:20] Gerard Donnelly: I'm going to start conservative and then I'm going to really, you know, the fact that you've been able to run 709 pace for 5K, you know, a lot of times we can, a lot of our athletes can run that in the second half if they're well warmed up.
[01:27:42] Gerard Donnelly: You know, if you are conservative, you could possibly do that.
[01:27:45] Gerard Donnelly: You've got great endurance.
[01:27:47] Gerard Donnelly: So you should be able to back this up with an easy, so we're saying to you, don't start too hard.
[01:27:56] Gerard Donnelly: But pick it up as you feel, you know, after the first month.
[01:28:00] Gerard Donnelly: The mile is 1,600 metres, 1.5km.
[01:28:05] Gerard Donnelly: First mile, from the first mile onwards, so from 1.5km onwards, start to, you you've only lost five seconds in that first mile.
[01:28:16] Gerard Donnelly: And then that's going to be a PB if you can run faster than that the whole way.
[01:28:23] Gerard Donnelly: So 45.58 is your fastest in the spreadsheet.
[01:28:27] Gerard Donnelly: Is that right?
[01:28:29] Gerard Donnelly: Yeah, sounds about right.
[01:28:31] Abby Jorgensen: You did that in April.
[01:28:33] Abby Jorgensen: I did a run off the bike 10k that I think was faster than that.
[01:28:38] Abby Jorgensen: Of course, I ran off the bike faster.
[01:28:41] Abby Jorgensen: Yep, I'm trying to say that.
[01:28:45] Abby Jorgensen: It was like early.
[01:28:48] Gerard Donnelly: Yep, it's just not in the spreadsheet.
[01:28:54] Gerard Donnelly: That's annoying.
[01:28:55] Abby Jorgensen: May.
[01:28:56] Abby Jorgensen: Yep.
[01:28:58] Abby Jorgensen: 9.1.,3.
[01:28:59] Abby Jorgensen: 11 11.
[01:28:59] Gerard Donnelly: 10.3..사람.
[01:29:00] Gerard Donnelly: So 450 for 6k, 450, sorry, 747 pace for 6k, 456 which is 755 pace, 8k, 10k you're in a 48, 41 in April, at 452 which is 747 mile pace.
[01:29:25] Gerard Donnelly: So that's the only one I've got in April, 48, 41.
[01:29:33] Gerard Donnelly: That sound right?
[01:29:34] Gerard Donnelly: Are you thinking faster somewhere?
[01:29:36] Abby Jorgensen: I mean, I don't know, it's, according to my watch, I remember my Garmin has one, maybe here, maybe I can, maybe my Garmin.
[01:29:46] Gerard Donnelly: April you ran fresh 45, 58 for 10k.
[01:29:52] Gerard Donnelly: That's your PB at 722 mile pace.
[01:30:00] Gerard Donnelly: 7.23 mile pace.
[01:30:03] Abby Jorgensen: Okay, yeah, I guess my run off the bike, 45.58 on April 26th.
[01:30:10] Abby Jorgensen: Oh, is that a run off the bike?
[01:30:12] Gerard Donnelly: Yeah.
[01:30:14] Gerard Donnelly: Oh, I've got it in as a fresh run.
[01:30:18] Abby Jorgensen: Yeah, according to my garden, it says 10K off the bike.
[01:30:22] Abby Jorgensen: Wow.
[01:30:24] Abby Jorgensen: 45.58.
[01:30:25] Abby Jorgensen: You're always running quite fast off the bike.
[01:30:35] Abby Jorgensen: April 26th.
[01:30:43] Gerard Donnelly: Whenever you're ready, TrainingPeaks, you can open.
[01:30:47] Abby Jorgensen: It hates the go back and...
[01:30:50] Abby Jorgensen: Yeah.
[01:30:51] Gerard Donnelly: So you've run...
[01:30:52] Gerard Donnelly: Oh, my God.
[01:30:56] Gerard Donnelly: That's impressive, Abby.
[01:30:59] Gerard Donnelly: Thank For more
[01:31:02] Abby Jorgensen: For some things, this type of stuff.
[01:31:04] Abby Jorgensen: Don't ask me what I did this morning.
[01:31:10] Gerard Donnelly: So you've run 712, 717, 730, 728.
[01:31:17] Gerard Donnelly: So you probably started a little bit too hot.
[01:31:20] Gerard Donnelly: Yeah.
[01:31:21] Gerard Donnelly: And you still ended up with a PB.
[01:31:23] Gerard Donnelly: Is that because it's uphill or downhill, is it?
[01:31:25] Abby Jorgensen: There might have been a tailwind.
[01:31:29] Abby Jorgensen: In April, it could have been a wind.
[01:31:32] Abby Jorgensen: Yeah.
[01:31:32] Abby Jorgensen: That's definitely uphill.
[01:31:34] Abby Jorgensen: I mean, is it much?
[01:31:36] Abby Jorgensen: Yeah.
[01:31:36] Abby Jorgensen: I mean, uphill as in...
[01:31:39] Abby Jorgensen: That's nothing.
[01:31:40] Abby Jorgensen: That is nothing.
[01:31:41] Abby Jorgensen: I mean, I don't know what you consider.
[01:31:43] Abby Jorgensen: Must be a wind.
[01:31:46] Gerard Donnelly: But look, that's a great run.
[01:31:48] Gerard Donnelly: I'm going to move that out of and put it in as a 10K run off the bike.
[01:31:53] Gerard Donnelly: Because April 26th is in there.
[01:31:57] Gerard Donnelly: I'm going to move that out 10K run a a as
[01:32:06] Abby Jorgensen: There could be a wind.
[01:32:07] Abby Jorgensen: They said it might be windy on Sunday as well.
[01:32:10] Gerard Donnelly: Yep.
[01:32:12] Gerard Donnelly: Windy and cold, that's always great.
[01:32:14] Abby Jorgensen: Yep.
[01:32:15] Gerard Donnelly: Jesus, you've ridden three hours before that, Abby.
[01:32:17] Gerard Donnelly: Bloody hell.
[01:32:20] Abby Jorgensen: That was good and ready.
[01:32:22] Abby Jorgensen: That's why I ran so good in a marathon after Fathom take.
[01:32:24] Abby Jorgensen: Yeah.
[01:32:26] Gerard Donnelly: I'd say you should get on the bike on Sunday morning and do some VO2 efforts, like a little ramp and then three 30-second low-cadence efforts and then one set of 5x30 on 30 off.
[01:32:43] Abby Jorgensen: Okay.
[01:32:44] Gerard Donnelly: Then jump in the car and then...
[01:32:47] Gerard Donnelly: It's only like a 15-minute drive, if that, so...
[01:32:50] Abby Jorgensen: Yep.
[01:32:50] Gerard Donnelly: So jump in the car, get out, and start warming up with the run.
[01:32:54] Gerard Donnelly: I don't know how registration is, but...
[01:32:56] Gerard Donnelly: Yeah, it's registration that day.
[01:32:58] Abby Jorgensen: It's just a small...
[01:33:00] Abby Jorgensen: I don't know how many.
[01:33:03] Abby Jorgensen: I'd never heard of it before, but it was only like $30.
[01:33:06] Abby Jorgensen: So I was like, what?
[01:33:07] Gerard Donnelly: mean, there's probably, you probably get anyone in it.
[01:33:10] Gerard Donnelly: So I'll put that session in there.
[01:33:13] Abby Jorgensen: I convinced another friend that's a runner to do it with me.
[01:33:16] Abby Jorgensen: So that's the sort of thing I'd do this one.
[01:33:21] Abby Jorgensen: Okay.
[01:33:25] Gerard Donnelly: So, yeah, go for it.
[01:33:28] Gerard Donnelly: Okay.
[01:33:31] Gerard Donnelly: Now, you did that in April, remember?
[01:33:34] Gerard Donnelly: it's not.
[01:33:34] Gerard Donnelly: Yeah.
[01:33:35] Abby Jorgensen: I mean, I'm not capable of like that right around that time.
[01:33:39] Abby Jorgensen: And I mean, I feel faster now.
[01:33:42] Abby Jorgensen: Yeah, sure.
[01:33:43] Abby Jorgensen: But it depends on how the cold affects me.
[01:33:46] Abby Jorgensen: Sometimes it's hard.
[01:33:48] Abby Jorgensen: Yeah, it is.
[01:33:49] Abby Jorgensen: Over your legs.
[01:33:51] Abby Jorgensen: Definitely.
[01:33:53] Gerard Donnelly: All right.
[01:33:54] Gerard Donnelly: I'll just fix your spreadsheet.
[01:33:58] Gerard Donnelly: Okay.
[01:33:59] Gerard Donnelly: Okay.
[01:34:00] Gerard Donnelly: All right.
[01:34:01] Abby Jorgensen: All right.
[01:34:02] Gerard Donnelly: Well, yeah, it's all about execution.
[01:34:09] Gerard Donnelly: Yeah.
[01:34:10] Abby Jorgensen: With everybody.
[01:34:11] Abby Jorgensen: Yep.
[01:34:11] Abby Jorgensen: I'll tell, I'll message Coco and we'll go from there.
