## Transcript

[00:00:00] Gerard Donnelly: Yeah, I'm just tired today.
[00:00:03] Abby Jorgensen: I think everything's just caught up to me.
[00:00:05] Abby Jorgensen: it's like, when we hit Daylight Savings, it's like dark at like 4.30.
[00:00:11] Abby Jorgensen: Is it 4.30?
[00:00:13] Abby Jorgensen: Oh my gosh.
[00:00:13] Abby Jorgensen: I mean, it's dark already.
[00:00:15] Abby Jorgensen: So, yeah.
[00:00:17] Abby Jorgensen: And it's 5.10 right now.
[00:00:19] Abby Jorgensen: So, yeah, it's kind of depressing this time of year.
[00:00:24] Abby Jorgensen: It is, isn't it?
[00:00:25] Abby Jorgensen: Yeah.
[00:00:28] Gerard Donnelly: Um, how are you feeling?
[00:00:30] Gerard Donnelly: Are you doing a lot of gym work?
[00:00:32] Gerard Donnelly: Uh, is that contributing to your tiredness?
[00:00:36] Abby Jorgensen: Uh, I mean, I'm lifting three times a week, but I don't think it's contributing too much to it.
[00:00:47] Abby Jorgensen: I haven't slept good the last two nights.
[00:00:49] Abby Jorgensen: I was sleeping.
[00:00:51] Abby Jorgensen: I was sleeping good last week, this week.
[00:00:54] Abby Jorgensen: Or not.
[00:00:55] Gerard Donnelly: So, um, what are the hours like with all of your work?
[00:00:59] Gerard Donnelly: Is it?
[00:00:59] Gerard Donnelly: Is it the dog work getting less?
[00:01:06] Abby Jorgensen: Yeah, I'm working less there right now.
[00:01:09] Abby Jorgensen: I would say like I work two to six on Tuesdays.
[00:01:14] Abby Jorgensen: So only four hours on Tuesday.
[00:01:17] Abby Jorgensen: I work a full day on Wednesday just because it's the middle of the week.
[00:01:20] Abby Jorgensen: And then I don't don't work today.
[00:01:23] Abby Jorgensen: didn't work Monday.
[00:01:24] Abby Jorgensen: So, yeah.
[00:01:27] Gerard Donnelly: And what about the new job with the gym?
[00:01:31] Gerard Donnelly: How's that coming along?
[00:01:33] Abby Jorgensen: It's kind of on pause right now because the building owner has not been getting back to us.
[00:01:38] Abby Jorgensen: So, I mean, that's a little bit of a stressor, I guess.
[00:01:42] Abby Jorgensen: So other than that.
[00:01:44] Abby Jorgensen: Yeah.
[00:01:45] Abby Jorgensen: So that's kind of on pause right now.
[00:01:47] Abby Jorgensen: So other than that.
[00:01:49] Abby Jorgensen: So, so, so with that in mind, are you happy to keep taking more athletes?
[00:01:55] Gerard Donnelly: Yeah.
[00:01:55] Gerard Donnelly: I was kind of like, um, when.
[00:02:00] Abby Jorgensen: Like this week, we kind of, me and my friend kind of decided we were just going to put everything on pause because the other guy and then I got the email for another client.
[00:02:08] Abby Jorgensen: And I was like, well, I think this is a sign that I should be doing more of this in that sense.
[00:02:14] Abby Jorgensen: I mean, I enjoy doing this.
[00:02:17] Gerard Donnelly: How have you been going with Jen and Karen and the new ones, Pemberton?
[00:02:24] Abby Jorgensen: Yeah, Karen, we're just trying to figure out, you know, she's not used to training.
[00:02:30] Abby Jorgensen: Like daily.
[00:02:31] Abby Jorgensen: So it's just getting into a habit.
[00:02:33] Abby Jorgensen: And technology-wise, I'm kind of, she's struggling a little bit with the Wahoo and I don't know if it's, I can't seem to figure it out.
[00:02:41] Abby Jorgensen: She can't get her, it's like with the cadence and stuff and she said her chain keeps falling off.
[00:02:46] Abby Jorgensen: So I'm struggling to figure out what is happening.
[00:02:51] Abby Jorgensen: Yeah.
[00:02:52] Abby Jorgensen: She's using TrainingPeaks Virtual.
[00:02:56] Abby Jorgensen: Yes.
[00:02:56] Abby Jorgensen: I've been using as well because it comes with premium.
[00:02:59] Abby Jorgensen: Yeah.
[00:03:00] Abby Jorgensen: So I canceled my SWIFT.
[00:03:01] Abby Jorgensen: So there's no need to pay for two subscriptions.
[00:03:05] Abby Jorgensen: Like she's hitting her numbers, but her cadence is low.
[00:03:08] Abby Jorgensen: can't figure out how to get it to go up.
[00:03:14] Gerard Donnelly: And so when you talk to her about changing gears, has she got any gears left?
[00:03:23] Abby Jorgensen: She said that it only lets her like change like two gears and then her chain falls off.
[00:03:30] Abby Jorgensen: Okay, that's a...
[00:03:32] Gerard Donnelly: Like a bike mechanic issue?
[00:03:34] Gerard Donnelly: Yeah, she needs to take the kicker and her bike to the shop.
[00:03:39] Gerard Donnelly: Okay.
[00:03:40] Gerard Donnelly: And that way they can tune the bike and the kicker, the cassette.
[00:03:50] Gerard Donnelly: So is she riding outdoors at all?
[00:03:53] Gerard Donnelly: No, no.
[00:03:54] Gerard Donnelly: So the problem sometimes is that the cassette on the actual...
[00:04:00] Gerard Donnelly: The bike wheel and the cassette on the kicker are not quite gelling.
[00:04:05] Gerard Donnelly: So if you're going to spend a lot of time on the indoor trainer, I would be taking my bike to the shop with the kicker.
[00:04:13] Gerard Donnelly: That's a real hassle to do that.
[00:04:15] Gerard Donnelly: But you then get the guy at the shop to understand what happens with the chain.
[00:04:21] Gerard Donnelly: And so it's a service, you know, it's a simple bike service.
[00:04:26] Gerard Donnelly: If she did take her bike, do you know what bike she's riding?
[00:04:29] Gerard Donnelly: I can't remember.
[00:04:31] Gerard Donnelly: I can't remember off the top of my head.
[00:04:34] Gerard Donnelly: Yeah, so the choice is you just take the bike to the shop and then get it serviced so that all the gears are running properly.
[00:04:43] Gerard Donnelly: And then you bring it back and put it on the kicker.
[00:04:45] Gerard Donnelly: if the chain keeps dropping, then you take the kicker and the bike back.
[00:04:48] Gerard Donnelly: But I'd be inclined to take it all at once.
[00:04:51] Gerard Donnelly: Ring the shop and say, my chain keeps dropping on the kicker.
[00:04:55] Gerard Donnelly: Can I bring it in?
[00:04:55] Gerard Donnelly: And they'll go, yeah, sure.
[00:04:57] Abby Jorgensen: Yeah.
[00:04:57] Abby Jorgensen: Because I've tried to tell, I mean, I was like.
[00:05:00] Abby Jorgensen: Make sure the erg is off, and I think we've solved that.
[00:05:02] Abby Jorgensen: Yeah, you definitely have.
[00:05:04] Gerard Donnelly: You've got her riding the right power.
[00:05:06] Abby Jorgensen: No problem.
[00:05:07] Gerard Donnelly: If she's trying to ride a lower gear and the chain keeps dropping, well, that's probably preventing her from getting to a gear where she can spin a bit more.
[00:05:17] Gerard Donnelly: So it might be that the bike works at the outside end of the rear cassette, and then as soon as she goes towards the spokes, it's not gelling properly.
[00:05:27] Gerard Donnelly: So it's literally a 10-minute tune-up.
[00:05:32] Abby Jorgensen: Yeah.
[00:05:33] Abby Jorgensen: I've seen Mike do it.
[00:05:34] Abby Jorgensen: He just, like, turns something.
[00:05:36] Abby Jorgensen: Yeah.
[00:05:38] Gerard Donnelly: And look, the new DI2, you can just do it yourself.
[00:05:43] Gerard Donnelly: You put it into – you push the back button, and you just put it into a different mode, and then you can just click the gears, and it'll move the chain across one step.
[00:05:56] Gerard Donnelly: So you can do that yourself, and it's just a YouTube – Google YouTube, and it'll –
[00:06:00] Gerard Donnelly: I how to do it.
[00:06:01] Gerard Donnelly: But anyway, she's better off doing that.
[00:06:03] Gerard Donnelly: And I would be saying great work.
[00:06:05] Gerard Donnelly: You're really hitting the numbers.
[00:06:07] Gerard Donnelly: And if the change is the issue, then we need to just get that fixed.
[00:06:11] Gerard Donnelly: Yeah.
[00:06:12] Abby Jorgensen: She also struggles a couple of times, had some Bluetooth issues and it works in her garage and then she takes it inside and then doesn't.
[00:06:19] Abby Jorgensen: But we've pretty much figured most of that out.
[00:06:22] Abby Jorgensen: And then her pool is only 20 metres.
[00:06:25] Abby Jorgensen: So I usually go in and change her 25.
[00:06:27] Abby Jorgensen: Yep.
[00:06:29] Abby Jorgensen: Yep.
[00:06:30] Gerard Donnelly: I think in there, there is an option for...
[00:06:35] Gerard Donnelly: There is on the watch, but not TrainingPeaks.
[00:06:38] Abby Jorgensen: Yes, you're right.
[00:06:39] Gerard Donnelly: Yep.
[00:06:40] Gerard Donnelly: Select pool.
[00:06:43] Gerard Donnelly: Yeah, that's hopeless, isn't it?
[00:06:46] Gerard Donnelly: Yeah.
[00:06:48] Gerard Donnelly: When I'm using my form goggles, I can set the distance of the pool.
[00:06:53] Gerard Donnelly: And then it just comes up on TrainingPeaks properly.
[00:06:56] Gerard Donnelly: It's 20 metres.
[00:06:57] Abby Jorgensen: My pool's 20 metres.
[00:06:59] Gerard Donnelly: Um...
[00:07:00] Abby Jorgensen: Yeah, the only ones I really have to change are the 50 metres.
[00:07:04] Abby Jorgensen: just change the 40 metres.
[00:07:05] Abby Jorgensen: Yeah, and get them to do that.
[00:07:07] Gerard Donnelly: Because you can't be a crosswalk pool.
[00:07:09] Gerard Donnelly: Because sometimes someone might get a 50 one week and they go to 25 the next week.
[00:07:13] Gerard Donnelly: you get them to do that.
[00:07:15] Gerard Donnelly: That's not your job.
[00:07:17] Gerard Donnelly: Yeah, you want them to take as much control of the technical side as possible so that you're not having to go in and keep adjusting.
[00:07:25] Gerard Donnelly: And that goes for when they do an FTP test.
[00:07:29] Gerard Donnelly: You you should go and check that they've changed it.
[00:07:31] Gerard Donnelly: But if they haven't, you should text them saying, hey, you've improved your FTP, but it's still the old number in TrainingPeaks.
[00:07:38] Gerard Donnelly: That's your job, not you, Abby.
[00:07:40] Gerard Donnelly: That's your athlete's job.
[00:07:43] Gerard Donnelly: Because the minute you get, you know, if you get up to 30 athletes, you can't be checking everybody's settings in TrainingPeaks.
[00:07:52] Gerard Donnelly: That's them taking responsibility and being prepared and planned.
[00:07:57] Gerard Donnelly: You know, if they're not even doing that, you know.
[00:08:00] Gerard Donnelly: Their head's in another world somewhere.
[00:08:01] Gerard Donnelly: So, you know, you and I would know that, Jesus, if we come to do this session and our settings are wrong, we could fail the session or it could be too easy simply because our settings are wrong in the TrainingPeaks or Zwift or Strava or whatever we're using.
[00:08:20] Gerard Donnelly: I do like the TrainingPeaks virtual.
[00:08:23] Abby Jorgensen: You can compare the trainer power with your pedals at the same time.
[00:08:29] Abby Jorgensen: And then it gives you lap average as well on the screen.
[00:08:32] Abby Jorgensen: Oh, that's fantastic.
[00:08:34] Gerard Donnelly: I've never used it.
[00:08:35] Gerard Donnelly: Yeah.
[00:08:35] Abby Jorgensen: So my pedals are about 11 watts higher than the Kicker.
[00:08:40] Abby Jorgensen: Yeah, that's interesting, isn't it?
[00:08:42] Abby Jorgensen: Yeah.
[00:08:43] Abby Jorgensen: Mine's 10.
[00:08:44] Gerard Donnelly: Jordan's is 20 the other way.
[00:08:48] Gerard Donnelly: His Kicker reads 20 watts higher than his bike.
[00:08:55] Gerard Donnelly: So, yeah, Karen's just got a little bit of teething issues.
[00:08:58] Gerard Donnelly: Otherwise, she's not.
[00:08:59] Gerard Donnelly: She's not.
[00:09:00] Gerard Donnelly: She's okay with, like she's all great.
[00:09:04] Abby Jorgensen: Yeah, I'm just trying to, yeah, the first week we just were trying to figure out the technology, the second week it was just trying to get into a routine.
[00:09:12] Abby Jorgensen: Yeah.
[00:09:14] Abby Jorgensen: I feel like that one, that's the one that didn't work.
[00:09:18] Abby Jorgensen: There's another one somewhere.
[00:09:22] Abby Jorgensen: The next week I think we did it.
[00:09:26] Abby Jorgensen: Yeah.
[00:09:27] Abby Jorgensen: Okay.
[00:09:31] Gerard Donnelly: Are you happy with her understanding of execution and stuff?
[00:09:35] Abby Jorgensen: Yeah, I just think, I think because she couldn't change her, I feel like it's probably higher than that, but I think getting her to do the sessions right now is like been the biggest struggle.
[00:09:49] Abby Jorgensen: Yeah.
[00:09:52] Gerard Donnelly: As long as she's got her settings set up right, you know, it's a low FTP, isn't it?
[00:09:59] Gerard Donnelly: Yeah.
[00:10:08] Gerard Donnelly: Yeah, okay.
[00:10:10] Gerard Donnelly: Are you happy with the session?
[00:10:15] Gerard Donnelly: Yeah.
[00:10:16] Abby Jorgensen: Yep.
[00:10:18] Abby Jorgensen: Oh, for goodness sake, what is going on?
[00:10:24] Gerard Donnelly: That's good.
[00:10:27] Gerard Donnelly: So Lap Power on TrainingPeaks Virtual, she's seeing that on the screen.
[00:10:33] Gerard Donnelly: Do you think she's using the bike computer at all?
[00:10:36] Abby Jorgensen: Yeah, because she sent me pictures because she's been trying to figure out, like, why, you know, the technology and everything.
[00:10:47] Abby Jorgensen: I mean, this is weird.
[00:10:48] Abby Jorgensen: She me about torque and stuff, and I was like, I don't know what the torque means on TrainingPeaks Virtual, so don't just ignore that.
[00:10:55] Abby Jorgensen: don't, yeah, so.
[00:10:57] Gerard Donnelly: If you looked at her session,
[00:11:00] Gerard Donnelly: A couple of Thursdays ago, she's doing the strength efforts at low cadence and look at her cadence.
[00:11:06] Abby Jorgensen: Yeah, which it didn't make sense because then she's struggling because I told her, I was like, well, your cadence was high on this session.
[00:11:13] Abby Jorgensen: So whatever you did, whatever you did this session, try to replicate.
[00:11:19] Abby Jorgensen: So that's why I'm confused of why she's struggling.
[00:11:23] Gerard Donnelly: And she's below the ranges there.
[00:11:27] Gerard Donnelly: It could be simply that she's not used to pedaling at high cadence.
[00:11:31] Gerard Donnelly: Yeah, I can't remember her background.
[00:11:36] Gerard Donnelly: Has she done many races?
[00:11:38] Abby Jorgensen: No, she did like a small triathlon, was it last year, I believe?
[00:11:44] Abby Jorgensen: But yeah, not really a whole lot of experience, I don't think.
[00:11:48] Abby Jorgensen: Yeah.
[00:11:49] Gerard Donnelly: Yeah.
[00:11:50] Gerard Donnelly: And I think, you know, she's not having a race issue for a long time.
[00:11:57] Gerard Donnelly: You know, it's the sunny coast one.
[00:11:59] Abby Jorgensen: All right.
[00:12:03] Gerard Donnelly: Is Karen coming to Australia?
[00:12:05] Gerard Donnelly: Is that what she's doing?
[00:12:06] Abby Jorgensen: Yeah, because of Jen, her daughter.
[00:12:10] Gerard Donnelly: So March at Gold Coast.
[00:12:13] Gerard Donnelly: Yeah.
[00:12:16] Gerard Donnelly: Is that the one in March or is she coming to the Sunny Coast in September?
[00:12:20] Abby Jorgensen: I believe it's the September one.
[00:12:22] Abby Jorgensen: September, yeah, okay.
[00:12:23] Abby Jorgensen: There's two.
[00:12:23] Gerard Donnelly: There's one in Gold Coast.
[00:12:24] Gerard Donnelly: There's one in Sunny Coast.
[00:12:27] Abby Jorgensen: So it's a long time.
[00:12:30] Abby Jorgensen: Yeah, we've got plenty of time.
[00:12:31] Gerard Donnelly: So just be relaxed with her.
[00:12:34] Gerard Donnelly: And your goal is right.
[00:12:36] Gerard Donnelly: You know, if we can get the three minimum runs, three minimum rides and two swims.
[00:12:44] Gerard Donnelly: But if you feel she needs more running, then, you know, add that other run on the Friday.
[00:12:53] Gerard Donnelly: Okay.
[00:12:54] Gerard Donnelly: Okay.
[00:12:56] Gerard Donnelly: With this, well, I tried to, but then she plays doubles tennis.
[00:13:00] Abby Jorgensen: And she's like, she's running around playing Devils.
[00:13:03] Abby Jorgensen: That's good enough.
[00:13:04] Abby Jorgensen: Yeah.
[00:13:04] Abby Jorgensen: Okay.
[00:13:05] Gerard Donnelly: For the minute, that's good enough.
[00:13:06] Gerard Donnelly: Yeah.
[00:13:07] Gerard Donnelly: Okay.
[00:13:08] Abby Jorgensen: What about Jen?
[00:13:09] Gerard Donnelly: Has Jen started?
[00:13:11] Gerard Donnelly: Yes.
[00:13:12] Abby Jorgensen: She's, she hasn't got the Wahoo Kicker from her mother-in-law yet.
[00:13:18] Abby Jorgensen: She ordered, she ordered the bike computer and I sent her a link for power pedals.
[00:13:25] Abby Jorgensen: So.
[00:13:25] Abby Jorgensen: Are you kidding me?
[00:13:27] Gerard Donnelly: She hasn't got it yet?
[00:13:28] Gerard Donnelly: Oh my God.
[00:13:29] Abby Jorgensen: I mean, she has the bike and she, she has a bike.
[00:13:32] Abby Jorgensen: So that's step one.
[00:13:34] Abby Jorgensen: She got that last Saturday.
[00:13:36] Abby Jorgensen: And then I was like, all right, do you have the Kicker?
[00:13:38] Abby Jorgensen: She's like, well, yeah, it's my mother-in-law's.
[00:13:40] Abby Jorgensen: But then she was like, well, we haven't gone and got it yet.
[00:13:43] Abby Jorgensen: So I don't know what that means.
[00:13:45] Abby Jorgensen: I don't know how far away they live, but.
[00:13:47] Abby Jorgensen: And you said she hasn't bought the power pedals yet?
[00:13:51] Abby Jorgensen: No.
[00:13:53] Abby Jorgensen: So I sent her a link.
[00:13:54] Abby Jorgensen: She said she already bought the bike computer.
[00:13:56] Abby Jorgensen: So that's on the way.
[00:13:58] Abby Jorgensen: Yeah.
[00:13:58] Gerard Donnelly: I'm to go.
[00:13:58] Gerard Donnelly: So I'm going
[00:14:00] Gerard Donnelly: So, so that I interviewed her on the 4th of October and she's like, I mean, super smart, but I think she's just so like hyper-focused on her work that I don't know.
[00:14:17] Abby Jorgensen: Yeah.
[00:14:18] Gerard Donnelly: Yeah.
[00:14:19] Gerard Donnelly: Super sweet, but yeah.
[00:14:21] Abby Jorgensen: Yeah, she's lovely.
[00:14:22] Abby Jorgensen: So is her mum.
[00:14:23] Abby Jorgensen: Yeah.
[00:14:24] Gerard Donnelly: But, but she's a procrastinator.
[00:14:27] Gerard Donnelly: Yeah.
[00:14:28] Gerard Donnelly: Super.
[00:14:29] Gerard Donnelly: I don't know how she goes at work.
[00:14:31] Gerard Donnelly: Like I've, I've had 10 text messages with her saying, do you need help?
[00:14:36] Gerard Donnelly: Have you bought your, have you bought your power meter?
[00:14:40] Gerard Donnelly: Have you bought your bike?
[00:14:41] Gerard Donnelly: Have you bought your Garmin?
[00:14:43] Gerard Donnelly: And it's just four days later, she texts back.
[00:14:46] Gerard Donnelly: I know.
[00:14:47] Abby Jorgensen: She, yeah, the first couple of days she was, she apologized for like, yeah, not getting back to me right away.
[00:14:53] Abby Jorgensen: But I think she's trying to be better about that because I, I'll mess with her and it'll take her like a good day.
[00:14:59] Abby Jorgensen: stating, Okay.
[00:14:59] Abby Jorgensen: Okay.
[00:15:00] Abby Jorgensen: To get back to me.
[00:15:01] Abby Jorgensen: by then I'm like, okay.
[00:15:03] Abby Jorgensen: Yeah.
[00:15:04] Gerard Donnelly: Well, so this is week one and we can't test her until she actually gets the power meter and the actual kicker.
[00:15:14] Gerard Donnelly: She lives in the Gold Coast.
[00:15:16] Gerard Donnelly: There is a velodrome, Abby, at the Gold Coast.
[00:15:19] Gerard Donnelly: Okay.
[00:15:20] Abby Jorgensen: That she could use.
[00:15:20] Gerard Donnelly: If you want to write this down, it's the Narang Velodrome.
[00:15:25] Gerard Donnelly: So she could drive there if she wanted to and do some training sessions there if she had time.
[00:15:32] Gerard Donnelly: But if she doesn't have time, she can use the indoor kicker.
[00:15:35] Gerard Donnelly: But Narang Velodrome is not that far from most of the Gold Coast.
[00:15:40] Gerard Donnelly: It would be, if you lived in the Gold Coast, it's probably a 15-minute drive to the velodrome.
[00:15:48] Gerard Donnelly: How do you spell that, the name of the velodrome?
[00:15:52] Gerard Donnelly: N, N for Nelly, E-R-A-N-G, Narang.
[00:15:57] Abby Jorgensen: Narang, okay.
[00:16:00] Gerard Donnelly: If I was staying in the heart of the Gold Coast, Surfers Paradise is the main centre, I could ride to the velodrome in 15 minutes.
[00:16:09] Gerard Donnelly: It would take me the same time to drive as it would to ride with the traffic.
[00:16:13] Gerard Donnelly: So I don't know exactly where she lives in the Gold Coast.
[00:16:17] Gerard Donnelly: I could actually, I could look up, is she running indoors or is she running outdoor?
[00:16:21] Abby Jorgensen: I think that one's indoors.
[00:16:24] Gerard Donnelly: That's not helping me.
[00:16:26] Gerard Donnelly: So there's nothing really I can look at.
[00:16:28] Gerard Donnelly: Is that outdoor?
[00:16:30] Gerard Donnelly: No, I don't think so.
[00:16:33] Gerard Donnelly: Nope.
[00:16:35] Gerard Donnelly: She goes to the gym, so it's, I don't know what she does.
[00:16:40] Abby Jorgensen: The problem is she only has an hour every morning the day she works, so it's hard.
[00:16:45] Gerard Donnelly: But the velodrome's no good then.
[00:16:47] Gerard Donnelly: But the velodrome could be good on the weekends because the velodrome, it's a little park, Abby, and it's got a race criterium circuit where they race around.
[00:16:59] Gerard Donnelly: So it's got this here.
[00:16:59] Gerard Donnelly: here.
[00:17:00] Gerard Donnelly: And then a flat section and it goes flying downhill and it goes down the bottom and then goes back up to the hill.
[00:17:05] Gerard Donnelly: So it's about a kilometre around and the velodrome is in the middle of it.
[00:17:09] Gerard Donnelly: So it's no cars.
[00:17:10] Gerard Donnelly: You can't have any cars on this track.
[00:17:12] Gerard Donnelly: So it's good for you to learn how to ride your bike outdoors on a Saturday or a Sunday.
[00:17:20] Gerard Donnelly: And you can do some on the velodrome and then some around the circuit.
[00:17:25] Gerard Donnelly: And it's got a hill where you've got to change gears.
[00:17:27] Gerard Donnelly: It's got a downhill where you get some practice.
[00:17:28] Gerard Donnelly: It's got a fast downhill.
[00:17:32] Gerard Donnelly: So that's, that's not a bad area to learn to ride safely.
[00:17:38] Gerard Donnelly: Okay.
[00:17:39] Abby Jorgensen: Okay.
[00:17:40] Abby Jorgensen: Yeah.
[00:17:40] Abby Jorgensen: Wish we had those here.
[00:17:42] Gerard Donnelly: Yeah.
[00:17:44] Gerard Donnelly: So I'm just checking.
[00:17:47] Gerard Donnelly: So you've got Pemberton who's new.
[00:17:49] Gerard Donnelly: Yep.
[00:17:50] Abby Jorgensen: We, she battled a stomach bug the week after her sister's wedding.
[00:17:56] Abby Jorgensen: Yes.
[00:17:56] Abby Jorgensen: I know.
[00:17:57] Abby Jorgensen: I guess everybody at the wedding, like pretty.
[00:18:00] Abby Jorgensen: They got it.
[00:18:00] Abby Jorgensen: They did poisoning, did they?
[00:18:02] Gerard Donnelly: Oh, my God.
[00:18:03] Abby Jorgensen: They think it was an actual virus because everybody, I don't know, had it and gave it to everybody.
[00:18:11] Abby Jorgensen: Nothing to do with food.
[00:18:13] Abby Jorgensen: Yeah.
[00:18:14] Abby Jorgensen: And then her and her wife just had to go down to Florida for IVF.
[00:18:20] Abby Jorgensen: So testing starting tomorrow, we're going to get everything.
[00:18:24] Abby Jorgensen: I think she ordered her power pedals and by computer.
[00:18:30] Abby Jorgensen: So that should be here.
[00:18:31] Abby Jorgensen: I think she said it should be here when they arrived.
[00:18:34] Abby Jorgensen: They must have just got home because she just finished that session.
[00:18:38] Gerard Donnelly: So she's got a kicker at home?
[00:18:40] Gerard Donnelly: Yes.
[00:18:42] Gerard Donnelly: So should you be moving the FTP test until she gets the pedals?
[00:18:47] Abby Jorgensen: I think she said they should be there.
[00:18:49] Abby Jorgensen: They were going to be arrived at her house by Thursday.
[00:18:52] Abby Jorgensen: Thursday, Friday, but I'll double check.
[00:18:55] Abby Jorgensen: And look, don't be afraid.
[00:18:57] Gerard Donnelly: Don't be afraid to say to her, no, we're not doing the test without the pedal.
[00:19:01] Gerard Donnelly: We can move it to next week.
[00:19:02] Gerard Donnelly: We can move it to here.
[00:19:06] Gerard Donnelly: And sometimes if they've never used the technology before, it's better to do that, Abby.
[00:19:10] Gerard Donnelly: It's better to just give them a practice session on Saturday, just so that, because, you know, it's like you're getting new equipment and you don't really know what you're doing.
[00:19:20] Gerard Donnelly: So I would be worried to give her an FTP test if she actually hasn't used any of equipment.
[00:19:27] Gerard Donnelly: Maybe just give her a pre-FTP, you know, one of those, you know, three sets of 30 on, 30 off or something.
[00:19:36] Gerard Donnelly: So she gets to practice.
[00:19:39] Gerard Donnelly: So it might be worth just telling her, hey, listen, you know, we normally like to do some training sessions using the equipment before we do an FTP test, because otherwise you end up doing an FTP test again, because nothing works the way you want it and you're getting frustrated.
[00:19:53] Gerard Donnelly: So, yeah.
[00:19:55] Abby Jorgensen: Otherwise, like, yeah, she's been good.
[00:19:57] Abby Jorgensen: She's been happy with the...
[00:19:59] Abby Jorgensen: Okay.
[00:20:00] Abby Jorgensen: Communication and just exactly what she wanted that she didn't get at with the other coach that she hired.
[00:20:06] Gerard Donnelly: And, you know, with every athlete that you've got, that's your number one goal is to make sure that they know you're looking and you're caring and you are.
[00:20:14] Gerard Donnelly: You're doing all that.
[00:20:15] Gerard Donnelly: You're unreal at it.
[00:20:16] Gerard Donnelly: So that's why most of your athletes are staying with you because they know you care.
[00:20:23] Gerard Donnelly: And you're doing a great job with that.
[00:20:24] Gerard Donnelly: So Jordan and are super happy with, and, you know, I haven't been helping you that much in the last month.
[00:20:32] Gerard Donnelly: So I apologize for that.
[00:20:34] Gerard Donnelly: But you really, I'm actually so confident in what you're doing that, you know, I sort of go, Abby's okay.
[00:20:43] Gerard Donnelly: I've got all these other spot fires I have to put out.
[00:20:46] Abby Jorgensen: I feel like the Noosa race and I don't, you guys have so much going on now that it's your season.
[00:20:52] Abby Jorgensen: And we're over here in wintertime and.
[00:20:54] Abby Jorgensen: Yeah.
[00:20:55] Abby Jorgensen: Yeah.
[00:20:56] Abby Jorgensen: Yeah.
[00:20:57] Gerard Donnelly: So, so it's really as, as.
[00:21:00] Gerard Donnelly: You get each new athlete, it's you trying to work out their personality and what they can cope with.
[00:21:05] Gerard Donnelly: You've already identified, Karen can't cope with much, just give her something easy.
[00:21:11] Gerard Donnelly: Jen's kind of disorganised, even though she's a very intelligent person.
[00:21:14] Gerard Donnelly: Sometimes that is a classic example.
[00:21:17] Gerard Donnelly: Intelligent people are the most disorganised.
[00:21:18] Gerard Donnelly: You wonder how the hell they succeed in life.
[00:21:23] Gerard Donnelly: But your job is to help her be more planned, and, you know, get that mental approach of, hey, Jen, don't just do this last-minute stuff, you know.
[00:21:33] Gerard Donnelly: Be organised the night before about what you're doing the next day and work out, have an appointment with your training session, especially if you're time poor.
[00:21:43] Gerard Donnelly: If you don't allocate the time, you'll miss the session, for sure, because, you know, you're too busy doing your main job.
[00:21:51] Gerard Donnelly: So, and Pemberton's definitely wanting, you know, wanting someone to hold a hand, you know, and work with that.
[00:21:58] Gerard Donnelly: And I don't mean literally.
[00:22:00] Gerard Donnelly: You know, she couldn't do it without you, but she just wants feedback.
[00:22:02] Gerard Donnelly: She wants to know why she's doing sessions and, you know, what's the purpose of this.
[00:22:07] Gerard Donnelly: You know, she's quite, I don't even know what the term it would use.
[00:22:15] Gerard Donnelly: So she's quite dominant in the way she interviewed.
[00:22:22] Abby Jorgensen: Yeah, she hasn't been that way with me that I've noticed, like the way she was in the interview.
[00:22:28] Gerard Donnelly: So she had a real determination of what she wanted and she wasn't getting that, which is fair enough.
[00:22:40] Gerard Donnelly: Yeah.
[00:22:40] Gerard Donnelly: Yeah.
[00:22:41] Abby Jorgensen: She like, she freaked out when she got sick because she thought, you know, I was going to put her backwards.
[00:22:47] Abby Jorgensen: And I was like, listen, we have so much time.
[00:22:50] Abby Jorgensen: You're fine.
[00:22:50] Abby Jorgensen: And she's like, that's what I needed.
[00:22:52] Abby Jorgensen: I need somebody to tell me that.
[00:22:53] Abby Jorgensen: I'm like, I get it.
[00:22:54] Abby Jorgensen: Like, we all have that mentality.
[00:22:56] Abby Jorgensen: But yeah, good.
[00:23:01] Gerard Donnelly: All right.
[00:23:01] Gerard Donnelly: Anything else on her?
[00:23:03] Gerard Donnelly: Nope.
[00:23:04] Gerard Donnelly: Just trying to get her up and started.
[00:23:06] Abby Jorgensen: And yeah, she does a lot of that run walk because of her knee.
[00:23:09] Abby Jorgensen: And so I told her I want to try to get her to get to where she can run without walking.
[00:23:16] Abby Jorgensen: Yep.
[00:23:18] Abby Jorgensen: She says she doesn't think that she can't.
[00:23:21] Abby Jorgensen: She can because I was like, can you do a 5K?
[00:23:23] Abby Jorgensen: She's like, I can do a 5K.
[00:23:25] Abby Jorgensen: I just my knees feel better when I do a run walk.
[00:23:28] Abby Jorgensen: So I don't know if it's a mental thing at this point or why.
[00:23:33] Abby Jorgensen: Yeah, me neither.
[00:23:37] Gerard Donnelly: Yeah, we just keep monitoring that.
[00:23:41] Gerard Donnelly: If you feel it's a bad idea to do a 5K because it might injure her, then we don't do it.
[00:23:46] Gerard Donnelly: just, you know, the only time we would test people as runners is if we're confident that we're not going to injure them.
[00:23:56] Gerard Donnelly: So it's important to get a line in sand.
[00:23:59] Gerard Donnelly: Mm-hmm.-hmm.-hmm.
[00:23:59] Gerard Donnelly: you.
[00:24:00] Gerard Donnelly: 5K time at the start, but there's so many athletes I start that they aren't capable of doing 5K.
[00:24:07] Gerard Donnelly: So I just get them to swim and ride testing, and they might be doing walk one program.
[00:24:12] Gerard Donnelly: So don't be afraid to do that.
[00:24:16] Gerard Donnelly: We get such a range of athletes.
[00:24:19] Gerard Donnelly: get guys who can run 15-minute 5Ks, and we've got people who can't make 5K.
[00:24:25] Gerard Donnelly: 15 minutes sounds crazy to me.
[00:24:30] Abby Jorgensen: That's the spectrum.
[00:24:31] Gerard Donnelly: It's so, you know, we've got everything in between.
[00:24:35] Gerard Donnelly: Some people can't make 5K, and, you know, one guy had 35 minutes it took him to do 5K, you know.
[00:24:44] Gerard Donnelly: And that's where he's leveled.
[00:24:45] Gerard Donnelly: That's where he level's at, and that's where I have to coach him at.
[00:24:48] Gerard Donnelly: And that's why we do it, to try and find out, you know.
[00:24:51] Gerard Donnelly: So there's no way we're giving anything more than just walk runs, you know.
[00:24:55] Gerard Donnelly: So this guy's 110 kilo, which is 200 and something pounds.
[00:25:01] Gerard Donnelly: Two-thirty, probably.
[00:25:03] Abby Jorgensen: Two-thirty or something.
[00:25:05] Gerard Donnelly: All right.
[00:25:06] Gerard Donnelly: Pick the eyes out of the people you've got the most worry about or that you need.
[00:25:13] Gerard Donnelly: One question I had to hear before you answered that one was, Andrew, with his Ironman, how did that go?
[00:25:22] Gerard Donnelly: The swim and the bike went good.
[00:25:25] Abby Jorgensen: The run, he started to have, like, stomach issues.
[00:25:31] Abby Jorgensen: Yeah.
[00:25:31] Abby Jorgensen: Yeah.
[00:25:33] Abby Jorgensen: I mean, he was super happy with finishing.
[00:25:35] Abby Jorgensen: Like, his wife was texting me the whole day, and then at one point, she, like, was walking beside him and, like, called me and was, like, wanted me to just, like, talk to him.
[00:25:47] Abby Jorgensen: Talk to him through it.
[00:25:49] Abby Jorgensen: Because, you know, I was like, you just got to – he's like, I can't keep anything down.
[00:25:53] Abby Jorgensen: He was dry heaving, and I was like, you just got to, you know, sip some electrolytes so you don't cramp.
[00:25:58] Abby Jorgensen: And then he – And
[00:26:00] Abby Jorgensen: He's finished running, so he's finished.
[00:26:04] Abby Jorgensen: But other than that, his swim went great.
[00:26:08] Abby Jorgensen: His bike, he pretty much stayed power-wise, what we were thinking.
[00:26:14] Abby Jorgensen: Yeah, super happy with it.
[00:26:17] Gerard Donnelly: What was the nutrition issue?
[00:26:19] Gerard Donnelly: Did you get to the bottom of it afterwards?
[00:26:22] Abby Jorgensen: No, I mean, because everything, he took a Morton caffeine, and I think the caffeine might have done it.
[00:26:30] Abby Jorgensen: But he'd been training with Morton, so he, yeah, he doesn't know.
[00:26:34] Abby Jorgensen: Had he been training with Morton caffeine, or is that Yeah, but he said maybe he just cooked too many throughout the day and didn't realize.
[00:26:44] Gerard Donnelly: Sometimes you need to dig deep and say, hey, you need to write down exactly what you consumed.
[00:26:50] Gerard Donnelly: And sometimes if we don't dig deep, we don't actually find, they say, oh, I did my normal nutrition.
[00:26:59] Gerard Donnelly: supuesto.
[00:26:59] Gerard Donnelly: Thank And...
[00:27:00] Gerard Donnelly: And normally I would go, oh, okay, that should work then.
[00:27:03] Gerard Donnelly: And then it doesn't work.
[00:27:04] Gerard Donnelly: I would say, well, can you just tell me what your normal nutrition is?
[00:27:07] Gerard Donnelly: And then I'm shocked at what I'm hearing because their normal nutrition is, for me, ridiculous.
[00:27:19] Abby Jorgensen: We're pretty sure it was the added caffeine one because after he took that, that's when things kind of went downhill.
[00:27:27] Abby Jorgensen: Yeah, but we never know next time what the problem was.
[00:27:30] Gerard Donnelly: If you don't find what the problem was this time, we're going into the next race.
[00:27:34] Gerard Donnelly: You he may never do an Ironman again, but, you know, you want to learn from what caused the shutdown.
[00:27:40] Gerard Donnelly: You know, if you don't find that out, and I would be asking him, how many grams of carbs were you having per hour and what was in it?
[00:27:50] Gerard Donnelly: And were you replicating everything you were doing in those long training days?
[00:27:54] Gerard Donnelly: And, you know, no, of the athletes don't write down.
[00:28:00] Gerard Donnelly: What they do in their long training days, you know, the attention to detail athletes who actually nail their race, they're the ones who are riding down in training, those long, you know, those long days of 140k, 160k, 180k, you know, the four by one hours, they're riding down in training peaks exactly what they consumed.
[00:28:18] Gerard Donnelly: So it's easy to see.
[00:28:22] Gerard Donnelly: And they're the ones who don't seem to have any trouble because their attention to detail is, you know, so good.
[00:28:29] Gerard Donnelly: It would be really worthwhile digging deep into seeing what is going on with his nutrition.
[00:28:38] Gerard Donnelly: Do you think he rode to the power instructions okay?
[00:28:42] Abby Jorgensen: Yeah, he was, we said about 120 to, top of my head, 120 to something, 140 maybe.
[00:28:51] Gerard Donnelly: Yeah, he really fell away in the second half.
[00:28:54] Gerard Donnelly: Yeah.
[00:28:55] Abby Jorgensen: So he was 1.06 in the second half.
[00:28:58] Gerard Donnelly: And he was...
[00:28:59] Gerard Donnelly: was 1
[00:29:00] Gerard Donnelly: He was in the ranges on the first half, 123.
[00:29:02] Gerard Donnelly: So that's a big drop-off, isn't it?
[00:29:04] Gerard Donnelly: Yeah.
[00:29:05] Abby Jorgensen: He said he felt fine the entire, like, he had a good time on the bike.
[00:29:10] Abby Jorgensen: I mean, he was ready to be off the bike.
[00:29:12] Abby Jorgensen: Yeah.
[00:29:15] Gerard Donnelly: Okay.
[00:29:16] Gerard Donnelly: Look, the main thing is that he's actually okay with that.
[00:29:20] Gerard Donnelly: Yeah, I mean, he was ecstatic to have finished.
[00:29:22] Abby Jorgensen: And, I mean, that was his goal was, like, finish.
[00:29:26] Abby Jorgensen: Finish, finish.
[00:29:27] Abby Jorgensen: Yeah.
[00:29:28] Abby Jorgensen: So for him, it was, especially all the troubles he had in the last couple months, the accident, his mom having a stroke, and so at this point.
[00:29:38] Abby Jorgensen: Was the temperature okay on the day?
[00:29:40] Gerard Donnelly: Yeah, it was, for Florida, it was 70s.
[00:29:44] Abby Jorgensen: Yep.
[00:29:44] Abby Jorgensen: So whatever that is.
[00:29:46] Abby Jorgensen: So, yeah, we've talked about his plan moving forward, and he wants to take a couple weeks of just nothing structured and then kind of get back into some structure.
[00:29:56] Abby Jorgensen: But a few days off during the week.
[00:29:59] Abby Jorgensen: So.
[00:30:00] Abby Jorgensen: But he's just, you know, doing stuff.
[00:30:02] Abby Jorgensen: But yeah, he plans on racing some 70.3s next year.
[00:30:05] Abby Jorgensen: So that's our goal moving forward.
[00:30:19] Gerard Donnelly: You try out your experience yourself, Abby.
[00:30:22] Gerard Donnelly: You know, your experience after the Ironman, I recovered better because I was moving.
[00:30:27] Gerard Donnelly: You know, and it's, it's not the actual structured session.
[00:30:30] Gerard Donnelly: It's actually just getting your body to move.
[00:30:32] Gerard Donnelly: And if you don't put something down, they won't move.
[00:30:35] Abby Jorgensen: I mean, had something and he's like, I'll just, I mean, he, he says, he communicates with me.
[00:30:40] Abby Jorgensen: He said, I've been moving and I just haven't done anything structured.
[00:30:44] Abby Jorgensen: Very good.
[00:30:45] Abby Jorgensen: Okay.
[00:30:48] Gerard Donnelly: I just want to quickly talk about the world champs, athletes, Linda and Peter, Coco and Peter.
[00:30:56] Abby Jorgensen: Yeah.
[00:30:56] Abby Jorgensen: Yeah.
[00:30:57] Abby Jorgensen: Yeah.
[00:30:57] Abby Jorgensen: Yeah.
[00:30:57] Abby Jorgensen: Yeah.
[00:30:57] Abby Jorgensen: Yeah.
[00:30:57] Abby Jorgensen: Yeah.
[00:30:57] Abby Jorgensen: Yeah.
[00:31:00] Gerard Donnelly: And Cindy's going, but we're not really communicating with her, are we?
[00:31:04] Gerard Donnelly: Who?
[00:31:05] Abby Jorgensen: Cindy?
[00:31:06] Abby Jorgensen: Yeah, because she's not paying right now.
[00:31:09] Abby Jorgensen: Yeah, well, it's still nice to see she would like this stuff.
[00:31:13] Abby Jorgensen: I don't know if – I think she's just doing the swim from my understanding.
[00:31:17] Abby Jorgensen: Yeah, okay.
[00:31:18] Gerard Donnelly: I've included her in the WhatsApp group anyway.
[00:31:20] Gerard Donnelly: Okay.
[00:31:21] Abby Jorgensen: Just to be kind.
[00:31:23] Abby Jorgensen: Yeah.
[00:31:24] Gerard Donnelly: So are you okay with Coco's race plan and everything?
[00:31:27] Gerard Donnelly: Everything's okay with her?
[00:31:28] Abby Jorgensen: No, we went really detailed because she got out there early enough that she's pretty much been on the entire course.
[00:31:36] Abby Jorgensen: Did you see the video that we did?
[00:31:40] Gerard Donnelly: Yep, I watched it this morning while I biked.
[00:31:45] Gerard Donnelly: And you need to ask them, have they watched it?
[00:31:49] Gerard Donnelly: Okay, I know it's long, but – Yeah, Coco watched it twice, she said.
[00:31:53] Abby Jorgensen: Oh, absolutely brilliant.
[00:31:56] Gerard Donnelly: By the sound of it, Peter's being what he's – Watched it too, yeah.
[00:32:03] Gerard Donnelly: So you're happy with Coco's race plan?
[00:32:06] Abby Jorgensen: Yeah, we were, you know, I had to kind of, with her, it's, she gets really excited.
[00:32:12] Abby Jorgensen: So I had to like, after she watched the video, she changed her plan a little bit.
[00:32:18] Abby Jorgensen: She wanted to kind of use the climbs and go above her ranges.
[00:32:22] Abby Jorgensen: And I was like, no.
[00:32:23] Abby Jorgensen: So we changed her plan a little bit, especially the first climb from there.
[00:32:30] Gerard Donnelly: That was helpful to, for you to have backup to say, this is not a good idea.
[00:32:34] Gerard Donnelly: Yeah.
[00:32:35] Gerard Donnelly: And I think she realizes that too.
[00:32:37] Abby Jorgensen: After, after she watched it.
[00:32:41] Abby Jorgensen: Yeah.
[00:32:42] Abby Jorgensen: So what's her range that she's going to ride at?
[00:32:45] Gerard Donnelly: Can you remember?
[00:32:46] Abby Jorgensen: I have it kind of here with me.
[00:32:51] Abby Jorgensen: Let's see, where's her?
[00:32:53] Abby Jorgensen: Oh, 180 to 210.
[00:32:55] Abby Jorgensen: So that's 210 is her 90%.
[00:32:59] Abby Jorgensen: she at her� queiramdes at that.
[00:32:59] Abby Jorgensen: So
[00:33:00] Abby Jorgensen: Yeah.
[00:33:01] Gerard Donnelly: And don't forget to look at what she did at Italy, all right?
[00:33:08] Abby Jorgensen: 182 is normalized, 177.
[00:33:10] Abby Jorgensen: Yeah.
[00:33:11] Gerard Donnelly: So, you know, make sure that her bottom end is lower than what you just said.
[00:33:15] Gerard Donnelly: So you said 180 to 210.
[00:33:18] Gerard Donnelly: I would be saying, you know, 160 to 190, unless her 60 minutes improves incredibly.
[00:33:27] Abby Jorgensen: Her last 90K was 185 average power that we did.
[00:33:33] Gerard Donnelly: Yeah, that's on the 19th of October.
[00:33:35] Gerard Donnelly: Is that right?
[00:33:35] Gerard Donnelly: Yeah.
[00:33:37] Abby Jorgensen: Yeah.
[00:33:37] Gerard Donnelly: And she did one on the 17th at 177.
[00:33:40] Gerard Donnelly: So she's done 185 and 177.
[00:33:43] Gerard Donnelly: So that's perfect.
[00:33:44] Gerard Donnelly: And then she's done Italy at, you know, 177.
[00:33:50] Gerard Donnelly: So, you know, she needs to be spending the majority of her time between really 175 and 185, Abby.
[00:33:56] Gerard Donnelly: And you wouldn't want to see too much above what
[00:34:00] Gerard Donnelly: I'm 95 and too much below 165.
[00:34:03] Gerard Donnelly: So that would be the range.
[00:34:05] Gerard Donnelly: So have already talked to her about all that?
[00:34:07] Gerard Donnelly: Yeah.
[00:34:07] Abby Jorgensen: Yeah, I can text her.
[00:34:09] Abby Jorgensen: Yeah.
[00:34:10] Abby Jorgensen: Just to give her a little lower range.
[00:34:12] Abby Jorgensen: Yeah.
[00:34:13] Gerard Donnelly: And in the second hill, if she feels, you know, on the way home, if she feels like it's too easy, then, okay, go up to that, to that 190.
[00:34:26] Gerard Donnelly: But, you know, still got to run.
[00:34:28] Gerard Donnelly: So, yeah, all right, good.
[00:34:32] Abby Jorgensen: Yeah, and then run, I mean, she runs really well, so.
[00:34:37] Abby Jorgensen: Yeah.
[00:34:38] Gerard Donnelly: She ran 402 in Italy.
[00:34:41] Gerard Donnelly: Yeah.
[00:34:43] Abby Jorgensen: Sorry, I'm using kilometre pace.
[00:34:45] Gerard Donnelly: It's not helping you.
[00:34:46] Abby Jorgensen: I wrote down kilometres for her because that's what she.
[00:34:49] Abby Jorgensen: It's not helping you.
[00:34:50] Gerard Donnelly: So what plan did she have for the?
[00:34:53] Gerard Donnelly: I always start around, like, the 410, four-minute mark and settle in it.
[00:35:00] Abby Jorgensen: At 3.55, and then 3K left, she's going to, whatever she has kind of left.
[00:35:06] Gerard Donnelly: Yeah, well, she pretty much ran a really fast race last time, and she ran 4.01, 4.02 for the two half.
[00:35:14] Gerard Donnelly: So, yeah, 4.10 to start with, and I would say the majority should be trying to run four minutes, and then if she can, you know, 12K, 14K, or 16K with 5K to go, then, you know, it's fine to do whatever she wants.
[00:35:30] Gerard Donnelly: But, yeah, that's good.
[00:35:32] Gerard Donnelly: I'm happy with that.
[00:35:33] Gerard Donnelly: And then the swim is what it is.
[00:35:36] Gerard Donnelly: Yeah, yeah, look, people worry about their swim times, honestly.
[00:35:41] Gerard Donnelly: You've just got to get out there and do the best you can, and the swim will be the swim.
[00:35:45] Gerard Donnelly: You know, we don't want to be, you know, the main thing is to get the bike right.
[00:35:51] Gerard Donnelly: I mean, don't over-swim ever, but get the bike right.
[00:35:55] Gerard Donnelly: Yeah.
[00:35:58] Gerard Donnelly: I'm to think what else.
[00:36:00] Abby Jorgensen: With her, yeah, it's pretty much, it's just, yeah, she's happy to be there, so.
[00:36:06] Abby Jorgensen: Yeah, good.
[00:36:07] Abby Jorgensen: She said it is pretty windy up on the, up on the hills, so.
[00:36:12] Gerard Donnelly: Yeah, it shouldn't matter though, Abby, you just, you just stay in your range, it doesn't matter what the wind's doing, it's not like you, it's not like you're on the flat and you're worried about the wind, you're on a climb most of the time.
[00:36:23] Gerard Donnelly: Yeah, I think she was more on the descents, it gets a little scary or something, or just, you know.
[00:36:30] Abby Jorgensen: Yeah.
[00:36:31] Abby Jorgensen: If it's a side wind.
[00:36:33] Gerard Donnelly: Yeah, but I don't think there's a lot of wind, so.
[00:36:40] Gerard Donnelly: Matt's been out there, you know, Matt Phillips, one of our coaches, and he's just saying there's not, there's just not much wind.
[00:36:47] Gerard Donnelly: And it's a bit swirly, but that's about it.
[00:36:50] Abby Jorgensen: Yeah.
[00:36:52] Gerard Donnelly: Okay, good.
[00:36:54] Gerard Donnelly: What about Peter?
[00:36:56] Gerard Donnelly: Peter's had a chat with him about his plan?
[00:36:57] Gerard Donnelly: Um, no.
[00:36:59] Abby Jorgensen: No.
[00:37:00] Abby Jorgensen: We're doing it tomorrow because he just got his bike today, so he was going to...
[00:37:04] Abby Jorgensen: How good a news is that?
[00:37:06] Abby Jorgensen: I know.
[00:37:07] Abby Jorgensen: We were going to wait until the day because I was like, oh, I want you to test out the new bike because I don't mean...
[00:37:14] Abby Jorgensen: I want you to see what the power is reading.
[00:37:16] Abby Jorgensen: And then he was like, hey, I just got my bike.
[00:37:20] Abby Jorgensen: I got to go get it and put it together.
[00:37:22] Abby Jorgensen: Let's talk tomorrow.
[00:37:23] Abby Jorgensen: And I was like, perfect, because then I'll have a talk with you to make sure everything's...
[00:37:27] Abby Jorgensen: Fantastic.
[00:37:27] Abby Jorgensen: Fantastic.
[00:37:28] Abby Jorgensen: Yeah.
[00:37:30] Abby Jorgensen: So...
[00:37:30] Abby Jorgensen: Are you ready for that talk with him?
[00:37:32] Gerard Donnelly: Are you thinking...
[00:37:33] Gerard Donnelly: What are you thinking he's done?
[00:37:35] Gerard Donnelly: I'm not sure.
[00:37:36] Abby Jorgensen: So for him, like most of his rides in North Carolina have been between like that 230 and 250 range.
[00:37:45] Abby Jorgensen: Yes.
[00:37:46] Abby Jorgensen: His last race, the power was reading high, the power meter, so we can't...
[00:37:52] Abby Jorgensen: Yes, okay.
[00:37:52] Abby Jorgensen: So we can't trust that.
[00:37:54] Abby Jorgensen: Can't trust that.
[00:37:56] Abby Jorgensen: But, you know, 230 to 250 seems to be where he sits in.
[00:38:00] Abby Jorgensen: And all of his, if you like isolate his climbing and his rides and not the descents.
[00:38:05] Gerard Donnelly: Yeah, he did an indoor FTP, is that right, damn it?
[00:38:08] Abby Jorgensen: Yeah, he was trying to get his bike packed up and had a whole bunch of things going on and he was like, I just don't have the time.
[00:38:15] Abby Jorgensen: And I was like, okay.
[00:38:16] Abby Jorgensen: No.
[00:38:17] Abby Jorgensen: Yeah.
[00:38:18] Gerard Donnelly: It's kind of the most important thing to do.
[00:38:21] Gerard Donnelly: Yeah.
[00:38:22] Gerard Donnelly: Damn it.
[00:38:25] Gerard Donnelly: So that's 75K.
[00:38:27] Gerard Donnelly: How did he go on that?
[00:38:32] Gerard Donnelly: He did that outside, so that's good.
[00:38:34] Gerard Donnelly: Yeah, he's done both of his rides.
[00:38:35] Abby Jorgensen: That was like just everything wasn't working against him that weekend.
[00:38:43] Abby Jorgensen: Yeah.
[00:38:47] Gerard Donnelly: So 2.34.
[00:38:50] Gerard Donnelly: So is that what you're thinking?
[00:38:53] Abby Jorgensen: Yeah.
[00:38:53] Abby Jorgensen: And then if you, then I was just trying to, because I know like there's a little bit of, know, something yeah.
[00:38:59] Abby Jorgensen: Yeah.
[00:39:00] Abby Jorgensen: Descending and stuff.
[00:39:01] Abby Jorgensen: I tried to isolate like when he was like actually writing, um, 242.
[00:39:15] Abby Jorgensen: Yeah, it's a bit unknown.
[00:39:17] Gerard Donnelly: I wouldn't be, I wouldn't be like, you know, what he's doing is what he's doing, you know?
[00:39:26] Gerard Donnelly: Yeah.
[00:39:26] Gerard Donnelly: So it's pretty, it's pretty even pressure on the pedals.
[00:39:31] Gerard Donnelly: Like, you know, if you, if you took those sections, 240, like you were saying.
[00:39:42] Gerard Donnelly: Yeah, it's pretty good, isn't it?
[00:39:47] Gerard Donnelly: He's pretty even, isn't he?
[00:39:49] Abby Jorgensen: Yeah.
[00:39:54] Gerard Donnelly: The thing is, can he keep that going for 15K?
[00:39:57] Gerard Donnelly: Um, what, what did he do?
[00:40:00] Gerard Donnelly: Doing that 90K.
[00:40:03] Abby Jorgensen: I think you're just...
[00:40:07] Gerard Donnelly: There's something not right there.
[00:40:13] Gerard Donnelly: Oh, 237.
[00:40:15] Gerard Donnelly: Oh, this is the day, yeah, he...
[00:40:18] Gerard Donnelly: A lot of stopping, isn't there?
[00:40:20] Abby Jorgensen: Yeah, it was a lot of...
[00:40:21] Abby Jorgensen: It was a climb and there was a lot of traffic up there, he said, so it was not ideal.
[00:40:30] Gerard Donnelly: Yeah.
[00:40:33] Gerard Donnelly: So, you know, looking at that, you know, I would be saying to him, I don't know what you...
[00:40:37] Gerard Donnelly: I can't remember what you just said, but...
[00:40:39] Gerard Donnelly: 230 to 250?
[00:40:41] Abby Jorgensen: Yeah, I'd be saying 220.
[00:40:43] Gerard Donnelly: 220.
[00:40:44] Gerard Donnelly: To 250.
[00:40:47] Gerard Donnelly: So he's got a little bit more of a range.
[00:40:50] Gerard Donnelly: Okay.
[00:40:50] Gerard Donnelly: Wait for him to tell you what he thinks first, Abby.
[00:40:54] Abby Jorgensen: Okay.
[00:40:55] Gerard Donnelly: You know, don't you offer...
[00:40:57] Gerard Donnelly: For any of these race planes, you don't tell...
[00:41:00] Gerard Donnelly: Tell them what you think is first, you discuss what they've written down, and then ask them questions about, you know, where did you get that data from, unless they haven't written down, you know, on the 26th of October I did 90k, and I did these power, that's what they should have written down, so you don't have to ask that question.
[00:41:19] Gerard Donnelly: But, you know, you really want them to explain to you how they think they can write those numbers, and you either agree with it, or you think that they're slightly too adventurous, or they're slightly too conservative, and have a discussion about that.
[00:41:39] Gerard Donnelly: So, you know, unless they've got incorrect data, and you know how we just went in there and had a look at the hill, and, you know, I look at the spreadsheet, it's just says he rode for that 90k, let's see, on the 18th, on the 18th it says he rode average power 207, so I'd look at that spreadsheet.
[00:42:00] Gerard Donnelly: Without going into the actual session and go, wow, you know, if you've only done 2.07, then your range should be 2.07 to 2.30.
[00:42:09] Gerard Donnelly: That's why I looked at the spreadsheet.
[00:42:10] Abby Jorgensen: I'm like, that's not right.
[00:42:11] Abby Jorgensen: I'm like, I know that.
[00:42:13] Abby Jorgensen: I remember that ride when he texted me.
[00:42:15] Abby Jorgensen: He's like, he's like, take a look at it because it's going to be a little bit all over the place.
[00:42:20] Abby Jorgensen: Yeah.
[00:42:21] Abby Jorgensen: Okay.
[00:42:22] Gerard Donnelly: So running off the bike, he ran 4.30 that day.
[00:42:27] Gerard Donnelly: 4.30.
[00:42:27] Gerard Donnelly: I'm sorry about the kilometer pace.
[00:42:30] Abby Jorgensen: No, those are numbers that I remember.
[00:42:33] Abby Jorgensen: I don't know why.
[00:42:35] Abby Jorgensen: He gets any higher than like 5 or something.
[00:42:37] Abby Jorgensen: I kind of know right around that range.
[00:42:41] Abby Jorgensen: What's he planning to do?
[00:42:45] Abby Jorgensen: I mean, I haven't talked to him, but usually, usually he's right around like the 1.25 to 1.30 half marathon.
[00:42:55] Abby Jorgensen: So that's a.
[00:42:58] Gerard Donnelly: So it's Santa Cruz.
[00:43:00] Gerard Donnelly: He did 4.02.
[00:43:03] Gerard Donnelly: Yep.
[00:43:04] Abby Jorgensen: Or 6, yeah, 6.30 mile.
[00:43:07] Abby Jorgensen: Yeah, great.
[00:43:08] Abby Jorgensen: Well, He usually likes to start conservative at 6.40, has been our past plans, start at 6.40 and then go into that 6.30 range is his comfortable spot.
[00:43:20] Abby Jorgensen: Great.
[00:43:21] Gerard Donnelly: Well, that's a good plan.
[00:43:24] Gerard Donnelly: And he's been running pretty well.
[00:43:26] Abby Jorgensen: He did some intervals last few weeks.
[00:43:28] Abby Jorgensen: And it felt good, so.
[00:43:31] Gerard Donnelly: He's missed a few runs off the bike, unfortunately.
[00:43:34] Gerard Donnelly: He missed that one.
[00:43:34] Gerard Donnelly: Yeah, he started to feel hamstring, so I told him not to do it because it's too quick to race things.
[00:43:43] Gerard Donnelly: Yep, okay.
[00:43:44] Gerard Donnelly: Well, that sounds okay to me.
[00:43:46] Gerard Donnelly: I'm happy with that.
[00:43:47] Abby Jorgensen: Yeah.
[00:43:51] Gerard Donnelly: Okay, who else is reasonably new that you're...
[00:43:55] Gerard Donnelly: James just had a race as well.
[00:43:58] Abby Jorgensen: Yeah, James.
[00:44:00] Abby Jorgensen: He did Turkey, didn't he?
[00:44:02] Abby Jorgensen: Yes.
[00:44:03] Abby Jorgensen: Was he happy?
[00:44:05] Gerard Donnelly: I mean, he's only been coached.
[00:44:06] Abby Jorgensen: Yeah, literally, I did a Loom video and sent it to him via text, and I was like, I've literally only been coaching you for four weeks or five weeks, and he rode the course almost perfectly in terms of headwind, tailwind.
[00:44:24] Abby Jorgensen: Yeah.
[00:44:24] Abby Jorgensen: And I was like, most people don't pick up on that until way later.
[00:44:32] Gerard Donnelly: Yeah, and that's fantastic.
[00:44:35] Gerard Donnelly: The things I'm looking at is making sure that his settings are right in TrainingPeaks.
[00:44:41] Abby Jorgensen: Well, we just didn't have enough, too much data, and his race-ready sessions were more zone two, a little bit of zone three, so we just kind of went with that.
[00:44:56] Abby Jorgensen: It was where he was comfortable at.
[00:44:58] Abby Jorgensen: Yeah.
[00:44:59] Abby Jorgensen: And just...
[00:45:00] Gerard Donnelly: These little things, you know, they don't look much, but they all add up.
[00:45:03] Gerard Donnelly: Eight minutes above 250 when his average for the ride was 145, you know.
[00:45:09] Gerard Donnelly: And then he's got another seven minutes.
[00:45:13] Gerard Donnelly: So he's got like a fair percentage there of – I mean, that's a – it's first go, so.
[00:45:20] Gerard Donnelly: Yeah.
[00:45:21] Gerard Donnelly: There's a lot of random turns in that race, too.
[00:45:24] Abby Jorgensen: Yes.
[00:45:25] Abby Jorgensen: Yep.
[00:45:25] Abby Jorgensen: And there's like a little section up there that – like a little square and then a U-turn right there.
[00:45:31] Abby Jorgensen: Yep.
[00:45:32] Abby Jorgensen: Yep.
[00:45:33] Gerard Donnelly: Yeah, that's kind of crazy, isn't it?
[00:45:35] Gerard Donnelly: Yeah.
[00:45:36] Abby Jorgensen: Yep.
[00:45:37] Abby Jorgensen: Okay.
[00:45:38] Gerard Donnelly: Is he happy?
[00:45:39] Gerard Donnelly: That's the main thing?
[00:45:40] Abby Jorgensen: Yeah, he is because his run – we predicted like a 2.12, the 2.15, and then he ran a 2.04.
[00:45:47] Abby Jorgensen: So.
[00:45:49] Gerard Donnelly: Well done.
[00:45:51] Gerard Donnelly: Yeah.
[00:45:52] Gerard Donnelly: That's great.
[00:45:52] Abby Jorgensen: Yeah, the data I had on him, was like, I don't know, 2.12 to 2.15 with, you know, start – he could have started.
[00:46:00] Abby Jorgensen: But he knows that he might have stuck a little too hot because he faded a little bit, but he's happy with it.
[00:46:10] Gerard Donnelly: He did a little bit of shuffling here, you can see.
[00:46:21] Gerard Donnelly: 546, 546, and 605, yep, so he has faded a bit.
[00:46:35] Gerard Donnelly: So, did he kind of say that, he just went out a bit hot?
[00:46:39] Abby Jorgensen: Yeah, and he said his legs started to feel the fatigue in the end of it, but he said that he rode the bike the way he was supposed to because he felt pretty good on the run.
[00:46:50] Abby Jorgensen: Yeah, fantastic.
[00:46:54] Gerard Donnelly: Great, and so what's next for James?
[00:46:59] Abby Jorgensen: He has some race.
[00:47:00] Abby Jorgensen: I don't think he's actually signed up for them for, like, two or three different 70.3s next year.
[00:47:06] Gerard Donnelly: Yep.
[00:47:08] Gerard Donnelly: Good.
[00:47:12] Gerard Donnelly: Let's see.
[00:47:13] Gerard Donnelly: Who else have we got there?
[00:47:14] Gerard Donnelly: We're jumping around a bit, I know.
[00:47:16] Gerard Donnelly: That's fine.
[00:47:18] Abby Jorgensen: I'm trying to think.
[00:47:20] Abby Jorgensen: John De Tosta, is he doing right?
[00:47:23] Abby Jorgensen: Yeah.
[00:47:24] Abby Jorgensen: Is Kyron new?
[00:47:26] Abby Jorgensen: Yeah, he got outside for the first time.
[00:47:30] Abby Jorgensen: This week, just learning to clip in and out.
[00:47:33] Abby Jorgensen: So, I got that done.
[00:47:37] Abby Jorgensen: His watch struggles with the swim stuff, so he has to manually do that stuff.
[00:47:41] Abby Jorgensen: Yeah.
[00:47:45] Abby Jorgensen: I'm pretty sure he did that.
[00:47:46] Abby Jorgensen: Yeah, he did those sessions.
[00:47:48] Gerard Donnelly: Is the rugby finishing?
[00:47:51] Abby Jorgensen: Yeah, this should be the last week, he said, unless they somehow make the...
[00:47:55] Abby Jorgensen: Which is good, yeah, because he was super sore and struggling.
[00:48:04] Gerard Donnelly: He was excited to test because I feel like I've improved a lot.
[00:48:08] Abby Jorgensen: like, I mean, he's usually above some of the ranges and stuff.
[00:48:12] Abby Jorgensen: Yeah, that's a big indicator, isn't it?
[00:48:18] Gerard Donnelly: Yep.
[00:48:20] Gerard Donnelly: What about Michael Abernathy?
[00:48:23] Gerard Donnelly: Yeah, he's yeah, he traveled this past.
[00:48:29] Gerard Donnelly: My page keeps freezing on me, which is really getting frustrating.
[00:48:36] Gerard Donnelly: Oh, where are you?
[00:48:37] Gerard Donnelly: Oh, yeah.
[00:48:49] Gerard Donnelly: Anybody that you're working with that you're, like we had with Peter, that you feel like you're not hitting it off?
[00:48:56] Gerard Donnelly: Mmh.
[00:48:57] Gerard Donnelly: Mmh.
[00:48:57] Gerard Donnelly: Mmh.
[00:48:57] Gerard Donnelly: Mmh.
[00:48:57] Gerard Donnelly: Mmh.
[00:48:57] Gerard Donnelly: Mmh.
[00:48:58] Gerard Donnelly: Mmh.
[00:48:58] Gerard Donnelly: Mmh.
[00:48:58] Gerard Donnelly: Mmh.
[00:48:58] Gerard Donnelly: Mmh.
[00:48:59] Abby Jorgensen: Mmh.
[00:48:59] Abby Jorgensen: Mmh.
[00:49:00] Abby Jorgensen: No, not particularly.
[00:49:03] Abby Jorgensen: Fantastic.
[00:49:04] Abby Jorgensen: Michael's just, yeah, he's such a, too, like one of those high-strung guys that's so busy that it's just, like this morning, I mean, he texted me, he was like, I slept like crap, I just got back from Vegas.
[00:49:15] Abby Jorgensen: I told you I was due 45 minutes, I couldn't even, like, so I was like, well, I mean, well, back on track, that's what happens when you go to Vegas, so.
[00:49:25] Gerard Donnelly: Yeah, and maybe, maybe if you know that that's going to happen, Abby, just give them something that's achievable, because sometimes when they travel and they're highly strung and they keep failing, then they'll just go, screw this program, it doesn't, it doesn't account for my, you know, inflexible work program.
[00:49:48] Gerard Donnelly: So, just be careful.
[00:49:50] Gerard Donnelly: I'd rather than do a 30 minutes where they're just doing zone two over-unders or something, just so that they actually feel like they're achieving, because, like.
[00:50:00] Gerard Donnelly: He gets on the bike and he rides for 16 minutes.
[00:50:02] Abby Jorgensen: mean, I had to talk about ERG, too, and then he questioned me.
[00:50:08] Abby Jorgensen: like, I don't understand why I can't have it on ERG.
[00:50:11] Abby Jorgensen: So then I had to explain that.
[00:50:17] Gerard Donnelly: Yeah, and he knows that from the interview.
[00:50:21] Gerard Donnelly: We're not using ERG.
[00:50:22] Abby Jorgensen: It's not teaching you anything.
[00:50:25] Abby Jorgensen: So I tell him, like, it's not making you a better, better, a writer.
[00:50:31] Gerard Donnelly: And, you know, that sentence I use, if we were able to use ERG mode in a race, it would be worthwhile doing it in training.
[00:50:39] Gerard Donnelly: But it's the actual opposite that happens.
[00:50:41] Gerard Donnelly: You know, if you've been using ERG mode your whole training program, then you go to a race, you're waiting for ERG mode to hold you in the ranges and you don't even know how to do it because you've never practiced it, you know, and you're all over the shop in the race and you go, I can't ride in the power because you never practice it in training.
[00:50:59] Gerard Donnelly: You because you're using ERG.
[00:51:01] Gerard Donnelly: I mean, I was happy that he did something while he was in Vegas.
[00:51:06] Abby Jorgensen: told me he wasn't, and he did.
[00:51:08] Abby Jorgensen: He was like, I didn't want to lose anything.
[00:51:10] Abby Jorgensen: I was like, well, that's good.
[00:51:14] Abby Jorgensen: But I think his daughter's sports are wrapping up early, like her main sport.
[00:51:19] Abby Jorgensen: So that frees up, I think, a little bit of time for him.
[00:51:23] Abby Jorgensen: He just is short of time.
[00:51:25] Gerard Donnelly: It's interesting how he's doing the session.
[00:51:28] Gerard Donnelly: And then he just goes, bang, erg mode for the last.
[00:51:31] Abby Jorgensen: Yeah, I don't know if it's just like he feels like he's, I got to have that conversation.
[00:51:35] Abby Jorgensen: Like, why?
[00:51:36] Abby Jorgensen: He's failing.
[00:51:36] Abby Jorgensen: He's failing the session.
[00:51:39] Gerard Donnelly: Yeah, no, he's going to crack it here.
[00:51:43] Gerard Donnelly: If he, you know, there's not too many sessions where he's achieving the goal.
[00:51:51] Gerard Donnelly: So, you know, the range he could ride at is 298.
[00:51:54] Gerard Donnelly: He's at 307.
[00:51:58] Gerard Donnelly: range he's doing, you know, the range he's doing, you know, range range he's he's he's he's he's doing,
[00:53:00] Gerard Donnelly: For him to be able to do 20 minutes at 260, Abby, you just can't understand why he can't do 40 seconds at 300, you know?
[00:53:11] Abby Jorgensen: I think he's have a talk about his sleep schedule, I think.
[00:53:16] Abby Jorgensen: Trying to remember, does he have his garment on there?
[00:53:18] Abby Jorgensen: Yeah, I can't remember what.
[00:53:20] Gerard Donnelly: Yeah, he's only got the bike, but I just got to make sure that they're using the same power meter.
[00:53:28] Gerard Donnelly: It's not the kicker, and it's not half the bike, not half the kicker, you know?
[00:53:33] Gerard Donnelly: It's got to keep...
[00:53:34] Gerard Donnelly: If they're failing stuff, we need to retest or something, you know?
[00:53:38] Gerard Donnelly: Even though he's just tested, like, there's no way he should be not able to do that.
[00:53:46] Gerard Donnelly: It doesn't make sense.
[00:53:54] Gerard Donnelly: Maybe...
[00:53:58] Gerard Donnelly: Maybe
[00:54:00] Gerard Donnelly: Maybe, Abby, let's take him away from some of the intensity stuff and just get him to do some regular training where we're going to not worry about improving his FTP.
[00:54:14] Gerard Donnelly: We're just going to get him to finish some sessions.
[00:54:17] Gerard Donnelly: He's just not completing many sessions, is he?
[00:54:20] Gerard Donnelly: Uh-uh.
[00:54:21] Abby Jorgensen: Well, there was a week he was travelling, all those reds where he was in a city that had nothing.
[00:54:26] Abby Jorgensen: Yeah.
[00:54:27] Gerard Donnelly: So this is a week where he's supposed to be at home and he's – I can't imagine you would have given him two runs in a row.
[00:54:33] Gerard Donnelly: So he's done back-to-back runs and another run, which is great.
[00:54:36] Gerard Donnelly: See ya.
[00:54:38] Gerard Donnelly: Yeah, I think he moved one of those.
[00:54:40] Abby Jorgensen: Yeah.
[00:54:42] Gerard Donnelly: So he seems to me like he's avoiding the bike.
[00:54:44] Gerard Donnelly: So in that week he's done one ride and he's done four runs.
[00:54:50] Gerard Donnelly: This week he's done two runs, no rides.
[00:54:55] Gerard Donnelly: This week he's done the FTP.
[00:55:00] Gerard Donnelly: Test.
[00:55:01] Gerard Donnelly: How did he go in?
[00:55:13] Gerard Donnelly: If it's ever going to open for me, that would be great.
[00:55:16] Abby Jorgensen: I can't remember if he did this one inside or out.
[00:55:20] Abby Jorgensen: Yep.
[00:55:22] Abby Jorgensen: He's done outside.
[00:55:24] Gerard Donnelly: Hasn't he got a power meter?
[00:55:25] Gerard Donnelly: He got, that's right.
[00:55:27] Abby Jorgensen: He got a new TT bike, but it doesn't have power meter yet.
[00:55:33] Abby Jorgensen: He just like literally like whatever day it was, he went and like he drove three hours to buy this bike off of Marketplace or something.
[00:55:43] Abby Jorgensen: Yep.
[00:55:44] Gerard Donnelly: And so, so what bikes are riding?
[00:55:48] Gerard Donnelly: What, what bikes are you riding here?
[00:55:53] Gerard Donnelly: I think I told him this TT bike.
[00:55:56] Gerard Donnelly: Yep.
[00:55:57] Gerard Donnelly: So he's tested on his road bike?
[00:55:59] Gerard Donnelly: Is that what's happened?
[00:56:00] Abby Jorgensen: That's trying to remember because I was like, once you have a bike, I want you on the TT bike, but we don't have power meters yet.
[00:56:09] Abby Jorgensen: So we put it on the kicker.
[00:56:12] Abby Jorgensen: We're going to have to use the.
[00:56:15] Abby Jorgensen: The core are going to have to use the kicker power.
[00:56:19] Abby Jorgensen: Because he can't he can't get a bike fit in the power pedals till December, he said.
[00:56:26] Abby Jorgensen: Financially, is that what he's saying?
[00:56:28] Abby Jorgensen: I know that's just when the bike fitter can fit him in is December.
[00:56:32] Abby Jorgensen: You can get the power pedals today, can't he?
[00:56:35] Gerard Donnelly: He said he was going to get it on the crank or something.
[00:56:38] Abby Jorgensen: Or like, I can't remember what his reasoning was.
[00:56:42] Abby Jorgensen: This bike fitter guy was going to do it all for him.
[00:56:48] Gerard Donnelly: This is the problem here with him.
[00:56:50] Gerard Donnelly: He's tested on one bike and then he's actually ridden on another bike there, which is fine.
[00:56:56] Gerard Donnelly: Again, what you're telling him is exactly right.
[00:56:59] Gerard Donnelly: But.
[00:57:00] Gerard Donnelly: I would be asking, what bike did you ride here?
[00:57:03] Gerard Donnelly: Is it the new bike?
[00:57:05] Gerard Donnelly: And using the kicker power?
[00:57:07] Gerard Donnelly: Because that could be the problem, Abby.
[00:57:09] Abby Jorgensen: Okay.
[00:57:11] Gerard Donnelly: So he's in a TT bike, which is not what he tested on.
[00:57:16] Gerard Donnelly: All right.
[00:57:17] Gerard Donnelly: So he's tested on this road bike.
[00:57:19] Gerard Donnelly: Am I right or not?
[00:57:21] Gerard Donnelly: Do you think?
[00:57:22] Abby Jorgensen: I think, I'm trying to, I'm pretty sure that was his road bike.
[00:57:31] Abby Jorgensen: Yeah.
[00:57:31] Abby Jorgensen: Okay.
[00:57:33] Gerard Donnelly: And he's got power in his crank on the road bike, has he?
[00:57:36] Gerard Donnelly: Yeah, obviously.
[00:57:37] Abby Jorgensen: Yep.
[00:57:38] Gerard Donnelly: Yeah.
[00:57:42] Gerard Donnelly: Like it's a whole, why is he so adamant that wants it in the crank?
[00:57:47] Gerard Donnelly: I mean, you should just buy the pedals and you have the power straight away.
[00:57:55] Gerard Donnelly: So he's just going to waste the whole of November riding with it.
[00:58:00] Gerard Donnelly: The kicker power meter on the TT bike.
[00:58:06] Gerard Donnelly: So his choice is that he keeps riding the other bike using his tested number.
[00:58:14] Gerard Donnelly: Because what we're doing is we're testing him on one bike and then he's training on the other using a different power meter.
[00:58:20] Gerard Donnelly: So there's a guarantee like yours is 11 watts difference.
[00:58:24] Gerard Donnelly: That's why he's failing these sessions.
[00:58:26] Gerard Donnelly: That's why I was asking before, what's going on?
[00:58:28] Gerard Donnelly: How can he do that good number for 20 minutes and he can't even do 40 seconds?
[00:58:35] Gerard Donnelly: So I would be asking him, what bike did you ride on the 30th and then what bike did you ride on today, the 6th?
[00:58:47] Gerard Donnelly: And if he's riding the TT bike, we don't have an FTP number using your kicker power.
[00:58:54] Gerard Donnelly: So do you know what I'm saying?
[00:58:56] Abby Jorgensen: Yeah.
[00:58:56] Gerard Donnelly: So he needs this next session next week.
[00:58:59] Gerard Donnelly: first time.
[00:58:59] Gerard Donnelly: he's So So
[00:59:00] Gerard Donnelly: This one here needs to be him doing 20-minute using the kicker power meter.
[00:59:07] Gerard Donnelly: If he's not going to buy power pedals for another month, then we can't – he'll fail every session because we're trying to train him to a different power number than he tested on.
[00:59:20] Gerard Donnelly: Okay, yeah, I'll double-check.
[00:59:21] Abby Jorgensen: I'm trying to remember, and I can't recall exactly how we did that.
[00:59:26] Gerard Donnelly: So I think we need to investigate a little bit further here, okay?
[00:59:30] Gerard Donnelly: Okay.
[00:59:30] Abby Jorgensen: Yep.
[00:59:32] Abby Jorgensen: All right.
[00:59:39] Gerard Donnelly: How's Kevin going?
[00:59:41] Gerard Donnelly: He's good.
[00:59:42] Abby Jorgensen: We started – his PT allowed him to add in some running.
[00:59:47] Abby Jorgensen: Yeah, for no play.
[00:59:49] Abby Jorgensen: Yeah, so we did one run last week, and then his PT said to add three more this next week.
[00:59:58] Abby Jorgensen: Yep.
[01:00:00] Abby Jorgensen: So, and the PT said, like, it's the tibialis, so I was questioning at first, because Kevin's like, he told me to, you know, walk and then run 10 minutes at an incline, and I was like, yeah, I was like, I thought, I couldn't remember if it was his calf or what it was, I was like, in an incline, that sounds, because he's like, my calves hurt the next day.
[01:00:24] Abby Jorgensen: I was like, well, you haven't, you haven't run, and your PT told you to run on an incline.
[01:00:32] Gerard Donnelly: Is a PT, in your terminology, is a PT a physiotherapist, or is it a personal trainer?
[01:00:38] Gerard Donnelly: A PT in Australia is a personal trainer.
[01:00:41] Abby Jorgensen: A physiotherapist, yeah.
[01:00:42] Abby Jorgensen: A physio, okay, yeah, okay.
[01:00:44] Abby Jorgensen: Yeah.
[01:00:46] Gerard Donnelly: So if a personal trainer's telling one of my athletes to, to medically do stuff, I would be questioning that, because they're not, in a, in a, in in in in a, few years.
[01:00:58] Abby Jorgensen: Okay.
[01:00:59] Gerard Donnelly: What do you call a
[01:01:00] Gerard Donnelly: Personal trainer in the States.
[01:01:03] Gerard Donnelly: Just a personal trainer, I guess.
[01:01:04] Abby Jorgensen: Or, I mean, in PT, we go physical therapist.
[01:01:07] Abby Jorgensen: We don't say physio.
[01:01:08] Abby Jorgensen: We just say physical therapist.
[01:01:10] Abby Jorgensen: Yeah, a medically trained specifically.
[01:01:13] Gerard Donnelly: Yep.
[01:01:13] Abby Jorgensen: Yep.
[01:01:16] Gerard Donnelly: So I would be absolutely questioning that.
[01:01:19] Gerard Donnelly: You know, we would never start someone back from an injury where they wouldn't be doing something on the flat.
[01:01:23] Gerard Donnelly: And they would be doing, you know, 30 seconds of running and then 30, 60, 90 seconds of walking.
[01:01:31] Gerard Donnelly: But we have to trust that the physiotherapist knows what they're doing.
[01:01:35] Gerard Donnelly: But the fact that he had sore halves and maybe, you know, six knots.
[01:01:41] Gerard Donnelly: I don't understand.
[01:01:42] Gerard Donnelly: Did the PT tell him to do it on a hill?
[01:01:45] Gerard Donnelly: Or did he just do it on a hill?
[01:01:47] Abby Jorgensen: On a treadmill, on an incline.
[01:01:50] Abby Jorgensen: That's what the PT said, to do it on a Yeah, I guess it's less, with the incline, it's less stress on the...
[01:02:01] Abby Jorgensen: The tibialis on the front.
[01:02:04] Abby Jorgensen: So that's why I asked him, I was like, what's the reasoning?
[01:02:07] Abby Jorgensen: And that's what he gave me.
[01:02:08] Abby Jorgensen: And I was like, I mean, it makes sense from that sense, but your calves are going to suffer.
[01:02:13] Gerard Donnelly: I thought he had a hamstring injury, but anyway, I could be wrong.
[01:02:17] Abby Jorgensen: It's a, yeah, they thought it was shin splints and it's more.
[01:02:21] Abby Jorgensen: Tibialis anterior.
[01:02:22] Abby Jorgensen: Yeah, it could have been a stress fracture, but now it's just the tibialis.
[01:02:27] Abby Jorgensen: So, yeah, okay.
[01:02:28] Gerard Donnelly: Well, let's just trust that process then.
[01:02:31] Abby Jorgensen: Yeah.
[01:02:32] Abby Jorgensen: He said that after a second run, he said he wasn't as sore as the first one.
[01:02:37] Abby Jorgensen: Yeah.
[01:02:38] Abby Jorgensen: Yeah.
[01:02:39] Gerard Donnelly: Doogie's going all right?
[01:02:40] Gerard Donnelly: Yeah.
[01:02:41] Abby Jorgensen: He's kind of back on track with everything.
[01:02:44] Abby Jorgensen: Yep.
[01:02:46] Abby Jorgensen: So.
[01:02:48] Gerard Donnelly: He's straightforward, isn't he?
[01:02:49] Gerard Donnelly: He did.
[01:02:50] Gerard Donnelly: Yeah.
[01:02:50] Gerard Donnelly: He, his FTP went up.
[01:02:52] Abby Jorgensen: It was crazy.
[01:02:53] Abby Jorgensen: I can't remember.
[01:02:54] Abby Jorgensen: Maybe 20.
[01:02:57] Gerard Donnelly: Fantastic.
[01:02:57] Gerard Donnelly: I don't, I can't remember what it was, but I know.
[01:03:00] Abby Jorgensen: Oh, he tested really well.
[01:03:01] Abby Jorgensen: Oh, yeah, like 50 or 40.
[01:03:05] Abby Jorgensen: 40 once, that's great.
[01:03:07] Gerard Donnelly: From the last time because he's just been doing so much riding and other stuff.
[01:03:11] Abby Jorgensen: Yep.
[01:03:12] Abby Jorgensen: But yeah, I talked to him about the swift races and he was like, I know Gerard doesn't want me to do them, but they keep me motivated.
[01:03:19] Abby Jorgensen: And I was like, well, as long as you do, you can do your swift race and then you have to hit your other session.
[01:03:29] Gerard Donnelly: That's great, Abby.
[01:03:30] Gerard Donnelly: That's really good.
[01:03:31] Gerard Donnelly: No, I'm not dead against this with racing, but we have to make sure we look at what race he's doing.
[01:03:38] Gerard Donnelly: What races are he doing?
[01:03:40] Abby Jorgensen: I mean, it's a group thing.
[01:03:44] Abby Jorgensen: I don't actually understand the racing thing.
[01:03:49] Abby Jorgensen: He said it's a group that he's in that does it.
[01:03:53] Abby Jorgensen: So.
[01:03:54] Abby Jorgensen: So.
[01:03:55] Abby Jorgensen: So.
[01:03:56] Abby Jorgensen: So.
[01:04:00] Gerard Donnelly: Yeah, but you just check things like what's his heart rate average.
[01:04:07] Gerard Donnelly: So it's 150, then you go to his FTP and his heart rate average there is 143, so he's actually getting pushed.
[01:04:14] Abby Jorgensen: He said it, he asked me because Swift told him he had a higher FTP after this race and I was like, we'll just keep using your old one until we test again.
[01:04:30] Gerard Donnelly: So his new FTP is right.
[01:04:32] Gerard Donnelly: That's great.
[01:04:35] Gerard Donnelly: So don't, if he does any Zwift training sessions, Zwift will have changed his FTP, which you and I don't have control over.
[01:04:47] Gerard Donnelly: Okay.
[01:04:48] Gerard Donnelly: So Zwift's number will be higher than what he sees in TrainingPeaks.
[01:04:54] Gerard Donnelly: And so when you look at the screen, Zwift will be telling him to ride higher power.
[01:04:58] Gerard Donnelly: When he looks at his bike computer.
[01:04:59] Gerard Donnelly: computer.
[01:05:00] Gerard Donnelly: His bike computer will tell him he's in the right power range, and that's why I tell all our athletes, it's an automatic thing in Zwift, Abby, they don't let you change it, they change it for you if you improve.
[01:05:15] Gerard Donnelly: Whereas in TrainingPeaks, they'll tell you that you've improved and you have to manually go and change it.
[01:05:21] Gerard Donnelly: So I'll be saying to him, you need to go to Zwift and manually get it back to 252, wherever it's gone up to.
[01:05:28] Gerard Donnelly: Otherwise, you look up, it's a different number to what you're looking down.
[01:05:33] Abby Jorgensen: That's why I like TrainingPeaks virtual now.
[01:05:35] Abby Jorgensen: It's like all the same.
[01:05:36] Abby Jorgensen: Yeah.
[01:05:37] Abby Jorgensen: I didn't realize it had that until I just really use it just for some sort of entertainment.
[01:05:44] Abby Jorgensen: Yeah.
[01:05:45] Gerard Donnelly: And look, eventually, you know, if you've got a course where it's rolling and your temperature's shocking outside or it's  down rain, you know, you can use these free rides to ride down.
[01:06:00] Gerard Donnelly: Congratulations, you know, so it has value.
[01:06:03] Abby Jorgensen: We're pretty much at that stage where it's cold.
[01:06:07] Abby Jorgensen: Yep.
[01:06:08] Abby Jorgensen: Yep.
[01:06:08] Abby Jorgensen: All right, Glenn?
[01:06:10] Abby Jorgensen: It's a snow this weekend.
[01:06:12] Abby Jorgensen: Oh, is it?
[01:06:13] Abby Jorgensen: Yeah.
[01:06:14] Abby Jorgensen: We'll see if it actually happens.
[01:06:23] Abby Jorgensen: That's as much as we could get in before he had to go to the airport because he's in whatever.
[01:06:30] Abby Jorgensen: So we did it.
[01:06:31] Abby Jorgensen: Oh, my God.
[01:06:34] Gerard Donnelly: That's so hard to do indoors, as you know.
[01:06:36] Gerard Donnelly: Yeah, he told me.
[01:06:37] Abby Jorgensen: He's like, this is harder.
[01:06:38] Abby Jorgensen: I'm like, yeah, I know.
[01:06:41] Abby Jorgensen: Where's he going?
[01:06:44] Abby Jorgensen: Jakarta.
[01:06:45] Abby Jorgensen: Oh, yeah.
[01:06:45] Abby Jorgensen: Okay.
[01:06:46] Abby Jorgensen: I don't know where that's at.
[01:06:47] Gerard Donnelly: He's got no riding.
[01:06:48] Gerard Donnelly: Oh, no.
[01:06:50] Gerard Donnelly: For five days.
[01:06:52] Gerard Donnelly: Yeah.
[01:06:54] Abby Jorgensen: Oh, my God.
[01:06:57] Gerard Donnelly: Yeah.
[01:07:00] Gerard Donnelly: He must be able to go to a gym bike somewhere and roll his legs over, surely.
[01:07:05] Gerard Donnelly: I'll ask him.
[01:07:06] Abby Jorgensen: Yeah.
[01:07:07] Gerard Donnelly: Just getting to roll his legs over for an easy spin session.
[01:07:12] Gerard Donnelly: So he's going to do the long run in Jakarta.
[01:07:15] Gerard Donnelly: Yeah.
[01:07:16] Gerard Donnelly: That's going to be hot.
[01:07:17] Gerard Donnelly: Is it hot?
[01:07:19] Abby Jorgensen: Where is that?
[01:07:21] Gerard Donnelly: Indonesia.
[01:07:22] Abby Jorgensen: It's similar to where he is.
[01:07:27] Gerard Donnelly: It's just as hot as where he is.
[01:07:30] Gerard Donnelly: To be fair.
[01:07:33] Abby Jorgensen: He, like, struggled.
[01:07:35] Abby Jorgensen: He had some knee pain last week.
[01:07:40] Abby Jorgensen: So I backed off some running and he got a massage.
[01:07:44] Abby Jorgensen: And he went to a physio and they said it's just tight muscles.
[01:07:48] Abby Jorgensen: So I told him to stretch and stay on top of that stuff because it can't be.
[01:07:54] Gerard Donnelly: Yep.
[01:07:56] Gerard Donnelly: All right.
[01:07:58] Gerard Donnelly: Mark?
[01:07:59] Gerard Donnelly: sorry.
[01:07:59] Gerard Donnelly: All
[01:08:00] Gerard Donnelly: He's good.
[01:08:01] Abby Jorgensen: He had a really good half marathon.
[01:08:05] Abby Jorgensen: Yep.
[01:08:08] Gerard Donnelly: So my page keeps closing on me.
[01:08:12] Gerard Donnelly: It's still open down here.
[01:08:15] Gerard Donnelly: It's gone blank on me.
[01:08:20] Gerard Donnelly: I can't say anything.
[01:08:30] Gerard Donnelly: Oh, here we go.
[01:08:31] Gerard Donnelly: Okay.
[01:08:31] Gerard Donnelly: We're back.
[01:08:37] Gerard Donnelly: I'm just always intrigued as first half, second half.
[01:08:40] Gerard Donnelly: Oh, my God.
[01:08:41] Gerard Donnelly: How many turns are in there?
[01:08:42] Gerard Donnelly: I know.
[01:08:43] Gerard Donnelly: I saw that, too, and I was like, what the heck?
[01:08:47] Gerard Donnelly: 145.
[01:08:48] Gerard Donnelly: Was he happy?
[01:08:49] Gerard Donnelly: Yeah, it was.
[01:08:51] Abby Jorgensen: That's great.
[01:08:52] Abby Jorgensen: That's great.
[01:08:53] Abby Jorgensen: can split.
[01:08:53] Abby Jorgensen: Jesus.
[01:08:55] Abby Jorgensen: When we talked last, we thought maybe like 142 to 145.
[01:09:00] Abby Jorgensen: And then when I talked to him, you know, he was right around there and he thought he could go like 140-ish.
[01:09:09] Abby Jorgensen: But yeah, he's been feeling really good on his run.
[01:09:13] Abby Jorgensen: Yep.
[01:09:15] Gerard Donnelly: That's terrific, isn't it?
[01:09:16] Gerard Donnelly: 138.
[01:09:19] Gerard Donnelly: I don't know about that one.
[01:09:22] Gerard Donnelly: I know it's not going work.
[01:09:31] Gerard Donnelly: I'm too scared to close a page now if I close a page.
[01:09:36] Abby Jorgensen: Damn it.
[01:09:38] Gerard Donnelly: Damn it.
[01:09:39] Gerard Donnelly: I knew that would happen.
[01:09:40] Abby Jorgensen: To your internet or?
[01:09:43] Abby Jorgensen: No.
[01:09:44] Abby Jorgensen: TrainingPeaks lately has been like you try to delete something and you have to do it twice.
[01:09:49] Abby Jorgensen: I know.
[01:09:50] Abby Jorgensen: If I drag something across, it stays in you.
[01:09:54] Abby Jorgensen: I don't know what's going on.
[01:09:55] Abby Jorgensen: It's been annoying me lately though.
[01:09:59] Abby Jorgensen: I don't I
[01:10:12] Gerard Donnelly: Who were we with?
[01:10:15] Gerard Donnelly: Who were we looking at?
[01:10:17] Abby Jorgensen: Mark.
[01:10:21] Gerard Donnelly: My brain is frazzled.
[01:10:31] Gerard Donnelly: Yeah.
[01:10:32] Gerard Donnelly: So that was a really good half marathon negative split.
[01:10:35] Gerard Donnelly: That's fantastic.
[01:10:36] Gerard Donnelly: He should be really happy with that.
[01:10:39] Gerard Donnelly: Yeah, he was.
[01:10:40] Abby Jorgensen: Because earlier in the week or like the week prior, he kind of felt something in his calf.
[01:10:47] Abby Jorgensen: And so we took a few days off of running.
[01:10:49] Abby Jorgensen: And then he was, you know, he was like, you know, he was questioning whether or not he was going to make it a game time decision.
[01:10:56] Abby Jorgensen: And he felt good and went for it.
[01:10:59] Abby Jorgensen: Yeah.
[01:11:01] Gerard Donnelly: No, that's good.
[01:11:02] Gerard Donnelly: Really good.
[01:11:03] Gerard Donnelly: Oh, yeah.
[01:11:04] Gerard Donnelly: He's been – he likes all the data and stuff that you give him.
[01:11:10] Abby Jorgensen: So he's kind of a data nerd.
[01:11:12] Abby Jorgensen: Yep.
[01:11:13] Gerard Donnelly: So he did a 20-minute indoor?
[01:11:18] Abby Jorgensen: Yes.
[01:11:21] Abby Jorgensen: He improved too, but I think 11.
[01:11:24] Abby Jorgensen: 11, did you say?
[01:11:25] Gerard Donnelly: Great.
[01:11:26] Gerard Donnelly: I think so.
[01:11:27] Abby Jorgensen: I mean, that's going off the top.
[01:11:30] Abby Jorgensen: Is it right?
[01:11:31] Abby Jorgensen: Yep.
[01:11:34] Gerard Donnelly: Terrific.
[01:11:34] Gerard Donnelly: Yeah.
[01:11:40] Abby Jorgensen: Yeah, his execution was pretty spot on.
[01:11:47] Abby Jorgensen: It almost looks like Eric's moving, doesn't it?
[01:11:57] Gerard Donnelly: Patence could be a little bit higher.
[01:11:59] Gerard Donnelly: That would be the only thing.
[01:12:00] Gerard Donnelly: Yeah, told him that.
[01:12:03] Abby Jorgensen: I'm trying to remember what he said.
[01:12:05] Abby Jorgensen: I can't remember.
[01:12:06] Abby Jorgensen: That's good, Abby.
[01:12:10] Gerard Donnelly: All right, so...
[01:12:15] Gerard Donnelly: Yep, you're giving him a good mixture, that's great.
[01:12:20] Gerard Donnelly: That session there, that's the new block, isn't it?
[01:12:24] Gerard Donnelly: Yeah.
[01:12:24] Gerard Donnelly: Yeah.
[01:12:25] Gerard Donnelly: So that one there, just grab the eight-minute one.
[01:12:31] Gerard Donnelly: If you grab these ones, Abby, the one, two, three.
[01:12:35] Abby Jorgensen: Yeah.
[01:12:37] Gerard Donnelly: You're quite correct, but that's these ones, which is nothing wrong with these ones, the three by eight, two minutes at that.
[01:12:44] Gerard Donnelly: But this one's, this is the one, two, three, this is the upgraded version.
[01:12:49] Gerard Donnelly: Oh, okay.
[01:12:51] Abby Jorgensen: Okay.
[01:12:53] Gerard Donnelly: And these are at 81 TSS, and these are at 92.
[01:12:59] Gerard Donnelly: These are to 92.
[01:13:00] Gerard Donnelly: Okay?
[01:13:01] Gerard Donnelly: Okay.
[01:13:02] Gerard Donnelly: So I'll just drag that one across for you.
[01:13:08] Abby Jorgensen: All right.
[01:13:09] Abby Jorgensen: Okay.
[01:13:10] Abby Jorgensen: Yeah, sometimes I don't know.
[01:13:12] Abby Jorgensen: They all look the same.
[01:13:14] Abby Jorgensen: Yep.
[01:13:18] Gerard Donnelly: Sorry.
[01:13:19] Gerard Donnelly: When I click the button, the page disappears on me.
[01:13:24] Gerard Donnelly: All right.
[01:13:25] Gerard Donnelly: So that's great.
[01:13:30] Gerard Donnelly: Um, who's coming to Australia?
[01:13:34] Gerard Donnelly: Erin, what's happening with her?
[01:13:36] Gerard Donnelly: She came to Australia.
[01:13:37] Abby Jorgensen: She's in jet lag, jet lag mode right now.
[01:13:41] Abby Jorgensen: Yes.
[01:13:41] Abby Jorgensen: Okay.
[01:13:43] Abby Jorgensen: I'm trying to get her to text me today.
[01:13:46] Abby Jorgensen: She's like, I can't even like get out of bed right now.
[01:13:48] Abby Jorgensen: I'm like, you know, I don't know, like to travel over there, but I can imagine.
[01:13:54] Gerard Donnelly: People have no idea how hard it is to sit on a plane for 24 hours.
[01:13:58] Gerard Donnelly: It's just really good.
[01:13:58] Abby Jorgensen: For even could can't like.
[01:13:59] Abby Jorgensen: Thank you.
[01:14:00] Abby Jorgensen: Yeah.
[01:14:00] Abby Jorgensen: What is it now?
[01:14:01] Abby Jorgensen: 16, 17?
[01:14:02] Abby Jorgensen: What are you, 17 hours ahead?
[01:14:03] Abby Jorgensen: 16?
[01:14:05] Abby Jorgensen: It just messes with you.
[01:14:12] Gerard Donnelly: Riley?
[01:14:13] Gerard Donnelly: He's good.
[01:14:14] Abby Jorgensen: He twisted an ankle, so we're just finally getting back into running.
[01:14:20] Abby Jorgensen: He went out for a 10K time trial, and they had big storms the night before, and he said he tripped over a branch.
[01:14:26] Abby Jorgensen: Oh, damn it.
[01:14:26] Abby Jorgensen: I know.
[01:14:28] Abby Jorgensen: Like, he's been, otherwise, he's spot on with pretty much everything.
[01:14:32] Abby Jorgensen: He's, he improved his FTP too quite a bit, I believe.
[01:14:39] Abby Jorgensen: I can't remember off top of my head.
[01:14:41] Abby Jorgensen: Oh, pretty stupid.
[01:14:42] Abby Jorgensen: Yeah.
[01:14:43] Abby Jorgensen: Oh, good.
[01:14:44] Gerard Donnelly: That's huge.
[01:14:45] Gerard Donnelly: 15.
[01:14:46] Gerard Donnelly: Yeah.
[01:14:47] Abby Jorgensen: He's a big guy, but yeah, he's a big guy.
[01:14:50] Abby Jorgensen: Yep.
[01:14:51] Gerard Donnelly: So, we missed that 10K.
[01:14:53] Gerard Donnelly: Yep.
[01:14:54] Gerard Donnelly: So, we, we do need to catch that up, okay?
[01:14:58] Gerard Donnelly: Yeah.
[01:14:59] Abby Jorgensen: Once his ankle.
[01:15:01] Gerard Donnelly: He's not able to run yet, fair enough.
[01:15:03] Gerard Donnelly: Yeah, we just did a run tomorrow.
[01:15:05] Abby Jorgensen: We're going to try it for the first time.
[01:15:07] Gerard Donnelly: Yeah, so forget about what I just said.
[01:15:09] Gerard Donnelly: I forgot he actually damaged his ankle.
[01:15:13] Gerard Donnelly: Yep.
[01:15:15] Gerard Donnelly: No, that's great.
[01:15:16] Gerard Donnelly: You're doing a good job.
[01:15:17] Gerard Donnelly: Oh, God.
[01:15:20] Gerard Donnelly: .
[01:15:22] Gerard Donnelly: There it is.
[01:15:23] Abby Jorgensen: Okay.
[01:15:25] Gerard Donnelly: There's really only Bill and Dan.
[01:15:28] Gerard Donnelly: Any issues with them?
[01:15:30] Abby Jorgensen: No.
[01:15:30] Abby Jorgensen: mean, Bill's just getting back into, like, a block of training.
[01:15:34] Abby Jorgensen: And then Dan is, you know, he's pretty consistent with everything, too.
[01:15:39] Abby Jorgensen: So, yeah.
[01:15:43] Gerard Donnelly: Makayla?
[01:15:45] Abby Jorgensen: Yeah, she's doing pretty good.
[01:15:47] Abby Jorgensen: She bought a TT bike.
[01:15:48] Abby Jorgensen: I don't know when it gets here.
[01:15:52] Abby Jorgensen: But her schedule's all over the place again, too, because she's flying everywhere.
[01:15:57] Abby Jorgensen: But we're trying to do the best we can.
[01:16:00] Abby Jorgensen: Is she doing Busselton?
[01:16:03] Abby Jorgensen: No.
[01:16:03] Abby Jorgensen: Yeah.
[01:16:04] Abby Jorgensen: Okay.
[01:16:04] Abby Jorgensen: She has an Olympic and shorter ones.
[01:16:08] Abby Jorgensen: then as soon as she gets a TT bike, make sure we test her on the TT bike.
[01:16:13] Gerard Donnelly: Yeah.
[01:16:13] Abby Jorgensen: I can't remember.
[01:16:14] Abby Jorgensen: I think she said it was going to take a hot minute to get here with the thing.
[01:16:19] Abby Jorgensen: Yeah.
[01:16:20] Gerard Donnelly: My biggest worry is Rihanna.
[01:16:23] Gerard Donnelly: I mean, she's hit some sessions.
[01:16:27] Abby Jorgensen: Least compliant, I call her.
[01:16:30] Abby Jorgensen: Yeah.
[01:16:31] Gerard Donnelly: That's good.
[01:16:32] Gerard Donnelly: Good.
[01:16:34] Gerard Donnelly: Early, early.
[01:16:36] Abby Jorgensen: And she's been trying to do some of those rides outside so they don't look as pretty.
[01:16:41] Abby Jorgensen: But I was like, I mean, as long as it's nice outside, do it.
[01:16:45] Abby Jorgensen: Because as soon as it doesn't get nice.
[01:16:49] Abby Jorgensen: But.
[01:16:50] Abby Jorgensen: Yeah.
[01:16:53] Gerard Donnelly: So I think from that little sentence, I just.
[01:16:58] Gerard Donnelly: Yeah.
[01:16:59] Gerard Donnelly: You
[01:17:00] Gerard Donnelly: Like, you can't even tell.
[01:17:01] Gerard Donnelly: I know.
[01:17:02] Abby Jorgensen: It's so hilly there that I'm like, it's hard to do, like, an actual session outside there.
[01:17:08] Gerard Donnelly: But she needs to not go on a climb to do that.
[01:17:11] Gerard Donnelly: You know, in Boulder, there are flat sections in town.
[01:17:15] Gerard Donnelly: Yeah.
[01:17:15] Gerard Donnelly: You she's gone on a climb to do it.
[01:17:17] Gerard Donnelly: That's what, yeah.
[01:17:26] Gerard Donnelly: She's like the same climb over and over again.
[01:17:29] Abby Jorgensen: Yeah.
[01:17:30] Gerard Donnelly: So ask her to do some of these sessions on the flat.
[01:17:34] Gerard Donnelly: So she can't do the 40-20s on that climb.
[01:17:36] Gerard Donnelly: you know, heaps of people ride on the flat in Boulder.
[01:17:39] Gerard Donnelly: You know.
[01:17:41] Gerard Donnelly: You don't have to go on the climb every time.
[01:17:43] Gerard Donnelly: The fact is she's actually training.
[01:17:46] Gerard Donnelly: That's my first.
[01:17:47] Gerard Donnelly: Yeah, that's what I'm like.
[01:17:48] Abby Jorgensen: I'm not going to complain too much.
[01:17:50] Abby Jorgensen: She's doing stuff.
[01:17:51] Abby Jorgensen: But there was one session she got pretty close to.
[01:17:55] Abby Jorgensen: This is it.
[01:17:56] Abby Jorgensen: Yeah.
[01:17:57] Abby Jorgensen: She got.
[01:17:58] Gerard Donnelly: Yeah.
[01:17:58] Gerard Donnelly: She's actually trying.
[01:17:59] Gerard Donnelly: That's
[01:18:00] Gerard Donnelly: Great.
[01:18:00] Gerard Donnelly: Very good.
[01:18:01] Gerard Donnelly: Yeah.
[01:18:02] Gerard Donnelly: I'm very happy with that improvement, Abby.
[01:18:05] Gerard Donnelly: Blair?
[01:18:07] Gerard Donnelly: He's good.
[01:18:08] Abby Jorgensen: Yeah, he, I think, I'm to think, he just had a FTP as well, maybe.
[01:18:16] Abby Jorgensen: I can't remember what week are we on to.
[01:18:18] Abby Jorgensen: Yeah, he just had one not too long ago.
[01:18:20] Abby Jorgensen: Yep.
[01:18:20] Gerard Donnelly: And he's gone, Tim, what's up?
[01:18:22] Gerard Donnelly: Well done.
[01:18:22] Gerard Donnelly: Oh, I know.
[01:18:24] Abby Jorgensen: Sorry.
[01:18:25] Gerard Donnelly: It's not recorded in TrainingPeaks.
[01:18:27] Abby Jorgensen: I believe it was close to 10, maybe 20.
[01:18:33] Abby Jorgensen: What date did he do it?
[01:18:35] Gerard Donnelly: Here?
[01:18:36] Gerard Donnelly: Yeah, right there.
[01:18:38] Gerard Donnelly: So you need to message Marvin.
[01:18:42] Gerard Donnelly: There's nothing in TrainingPeaks.
[01:18:46] Gerard Donnelly: I meant to say a spreadsheet, sorry.
[01:18:48] Gerard Donnelly: Yeah.
[01:18:48] Gerard Donnelly: don't know why it's in TrainingPeaks.
[01:18:51] Gerard Donnelly: So the last one in the spreadsheet is July.
[01:18:56] Gerard Donnelly: Okay.
[01:18:57] Gerard Donnelly: So can you just message him to say...
[01:18:59] Gerard Donnelly: Stay Thank you.
[01:19:00] Gerard Donnelly: There's something not right here, Abby.
[01:19:02] Gerard Donnelly: Have I got the wrong person?
[01:19:03] Gerard Donnelly: Yes.
[01:19:04] Gerard Donnelly: Who are we talking about?
[01:19:05] Gerard Donnelly: Blair.
[01:19:06] Gerard Donnelly: Yeah, I got the wrong person.
[01:19:07] Gerard Donnelly: Take that all back.
[01:19:09] Gerard Donnelly: I mean.
[01:19:10] Abby Jorgensen: I was in Bryon O'Loughlin's.
[01:19:13] Gerard Donnelly: No, that is all written.
[01:19:15] Gerard Donnelly: Take that back.
[01:19:16] Gerard Donnelly: Don't send that.
[01:19:16] Gerard Donnelly: Yeah, you're right.
[01:19:17] Gerard Donnelly: He's gone up 11 watts.
[01:19:19] Gerard Donnelly: So.
[01:19:20] Gerard Donnelly: I don't know how I remember all that stuff.
[01:19:22] Abby Jorgensen: Yeah, because you really care about what you're doing.
[01:19:25] Abby Jorgensen: So that's why.
[01:19:30] Abby Jorgensen: Weekend, he has a hockey tournament.
[01:19:33] Abby Jorgensen: Hockey starts back up.
[01:19:35] Abby Jorgensen: It was a couple of days.
[01:19:36] Abby Jorgensen: There was one day that he was below his targets.
[01:19:38] Abby Jorgensen: And I was like, did you stay up?
[01:19:40] Abby Jorgensen: He stayed up to watch.
[01:19:41] Abby Jorgensen: I don't know if you guys follow baseball, but the Toronto.
[01:19:47] Abby Jorgensen: He had stayed up a little too late for the baseball game and was a little tired.
[01:19:53] Abby Jorgensen: But yeah, his 5k or his 10k was also fantastic.
[01:19:58] Gerard Donnelly: That's a two minute improvement.
[01:20:00] Gerard Donnelly: Yeah.
[01:20:01] Gerard Donnelly: Well done, Abby.
[01:20:03] Gerard Donnelly: Hats off to you.
[01:20:04] Gerard Donnelly: That's great.
[01:20:06] Gerard Donnelly: I think Philippe was the other guy.
[01:20:09] Gerard Donnelly: Yeah, he's good too.
[01:20:11] Abby Jorgensen: He just, he improved too.
[01:20:14] Abby Jorgensen: We didn't think he was because he's been hunting and stuff on the weekends, but it was quite a big improvement as well.
[01:20:23] Gerard Donnelly: Just let me grab his name, Philippe.
[01:20:27] Gerard Donnelly: Philippe.
[01:20:29] Abby Jorgensen: Yep.
[01:20:30] Abby Jorgensen: Another 11 watts.
[01:20:31] Gerard Donnelly: Jesus.
[01:20:31] Gerard Donnelly: He started at 220 and now he's at 264.
[01:20:34] Gerard Donnelly: That's 44 watts.
[01:20:35] Gerard Donnelly: You need to tell him that.
[01:20:38] Gerard Donnelly: That's bloody brilliant.
[01:20:42] Gerard Donnelly: You're a champ.
[01:20:43] Gerard Donnelly: Well done, coach.
[01:20:44] Abby Jorgensen: Thanks.
[01:20:45] Abby Jorgensen: Really good.
[01:20:47] Abby Jorgensen: He goes up north a lot, but we've worked out like everything.
[01:20:53] Abby Jorgensen: Yep.
[01:20:54] Gerard Donnelly: So just keep progressing.
[01:20:56] Gerard Donnelly: Um, Dan.
[01:21:02] Abby Jorgensen: He's coming up on a 70.3 next weekend, I believe.
[01:21:07] Abby Jorgensen: Yeah.
[01:21:08] Abby Jorgensen: Are you ready?
[01:21:10] Abby Jorgensen: Yeah.
[01:21:12] Abby Jorgensen: Yeah.
[01:21:13] Abby Jorgensen: He's doing a 60-minute.
[01:21:14] Gerard Donnelly: Make sure he does that and doesn't miss it.
[01:21:18] Gerard Donnelly: Yeah.
[01:21:18] Abby Jorgensen: I don't think he will, although he says there's some sickness going around his house.
[01:21:23] Abby Jorgensen: So I was like, stay away from everybody.
[01:21:25] Abby Jorgensen: Yeah.
[01:21:26] Gerard Donnelly: And try, if he does it when he's on his course outside, has he been?
[01:21:39] Abby Jorgensen: That's great.
[01:21:40] Abby Jorgensen: That's great.
[01:21:41] Abby Jorgensen: Yeah.
[01:21:42] Gerard Donnelly: So we want him to do 15 minutes out and back for that 60-minuter, not 30.
[01:21:47] Gerard Donnelly: Okay.
[01:21:48] Abby Jorgensen: Can you make sure you're telling that?
[01:21:49] Abby Jorgensen: Yeah.
[01:21:50] Gerard Donnelly: He rides well, isn't he?
[01:21:52] Gerard Donnelly: Mm-hmm.
[01:21:53] Abby Jorgensen: 250 at 36.
[01:21:56] Gerard Donnelly: That's 23 miles an hour, is it?
[01:21:58] Gerard Donnelly: Yeah.
[01:21:59] Gerard Donnelly: cases.
[01:22:00] Gerard Donnelly: I think so.
[01:22:01] Abby Jorgensen: That's pretty damn good riding.
[01:22:04] Gerard Donnelly: He ran 41 minutes off the bike for 10K.
[01:22:08] Gerard Donnelly: Yeah, he's a good runner.
[01:22:10] Abby Jorgensen: This guy's good.
[01:22:12] Gerard Donnelly: Yeah, it's just his swim that's, I think, holding him back.
[01:22:17] Gerard Donnelly: Okay.
[01:22:20] Abby Jorgensen: He's a government worker right now.
[01:22:23] Abby Jorgensen: Yeah.
[01:22:26] Abby Jorgensen: Good luck with that.
[01:22:27] Abby Jorgensen: Yeah.
[01:22:28] Gerard Donnelly: I think that's everybody, it, Bill?
[01:22:30] Gerard Donnelly: You happy with Bill?
[01:22:31] Abby Jorgensen: Yeah, we're just going along.
[01:22:35] Abby Jorgensen: He did his first, like, higher intensity workout today, and he was like, I got through it, and I just got to get used to doing that again.
[01:22:44] Abby Jorgensen: I'm like, yeah, the first one is always a kind of a shock to the system after an iron.
[01:22:50] Abby Jorgensen: I can attest to that.
[01:22:53] Gerard Donnelly: I've got a new guy from Switzerland, if you want.
[01:22:56] Gerard Donnelly: Yeah, Sin or whatever.
[01:22:58] Abby Jorgensen: Yeah, it's really weird.
[01:23:00] Abby Jorgensen: Yeah, didn't know if it was a, before I opened it, I didn't know if it was female or male.
[01:23:05] Abby Jorgensen: He's a young guy, Sin Percaflish.
[01:23:08] Gerard Donnelly: Yep.
[01:23:10] Gerard Donnelly: He was a really nice guy.
[01:23:11] Gerard Donnelly: Did you get the video?
[01:23:13] Abby Jorgensen: Yeah, I got the video in his profile, but I didn't know if it was TrainingPeaks.
[01:23:17] Abby Jorgensen: Yep.
[01:23:20] Gerard Donnelly: So just let me check TrainingPeaks.
[01:23:31] Abby Jorgensen: There he is.
[01:23:33] Abby Jorgensen: So I'll send him to you.
[01:23:35] Gerard Donnelly: Oh, boy.
[01:23:36] Gerard Donnelly: Boy.
[01:23:39] Gerard Donnelly: Come on.
[01:23:40] Gerard Donnelly: Right, there he is.
[01:23:42] Gerard Donnelly: Abby.
[01:23:46] Gerard Donnelly: Abby.
[01:23:47] Gerard Donnelly: And he's ready to go.
[01:23:58] Gerard Donnelly: Can you say anything?
[01:23:59] Gerard Donnelly: Can
[01:24:01] Gerard Donnelly: Not yet, not until you, yeah.
[01:24:08] Gerard Donnelly: It's actually come to you now.
[01:24:10] Abby Jorgensen: Yeah, because I think, yeah, because Jordan had told me, I didn't know this, he said at 25 athletes there's like another bonus or whatever.
[01:24:20] Abby Jorgensen: Yes, that's right.
[01:24:22] Abby Jorgensen: I'm keen to get you up there.
[01:24:24] Abby Jorgensen: No, I appreciate it.
[01:24:31] Gerard Donnelly: Yeah, so I've got a couple more interviews coming up.
[01:24:37] Gerard Donnelly: I do have another guy who's from Scotland, but he said he was moving to Houston.
[01:24:44] Gerard Donnelly: I interviewed him last week.
[01:24:46] Gerard Donnelly: He's not ready to start until January.
[01:24:48] Gerard Donnelly: So I said Abby would be your coach.
[01:24:53] Gerard Donnelly: But then he texted me last week and said he might be moving to Australia.
[01:24:56] Gerard Donnelly: So, and he's really.
[01:25:00] Gerard Donnelly: Really hopeless.
[01:25:01] Gerard Donnelly: Like, I text him around here for five days.
[01:25:05] Gerard Donnelly: So there is another girl I'm going to interview, Sanna van der R, from Norway or Switzerland, I think, that we could give you.
[01:25:18] Gerard Donnelly: And there's another guy, Dan Barker, who I've been coaching for, I don't know, three years.
[01:25:24] Gerard Donnelly: He's from Seattle area.
[01:25:28] Gerard Donnelly: And he's got one lung, Abby.
[01:25:31] Gerard Donnelly: And so I've kind of had him as a bit of a special project where I've really gone overboard to – he has a handicap.
[01:25:44] Gerard Donnelly: He has one lung.
[01:25:45] Gerard Donnelly: It's quite significant.
[01:25:47] Gerard Donnelly: But he's done an Ironman.
[01:25:49] Gerard Donnelly: He's done half Ironman.
[01:25:50] Gerard Donnelly: He's out there doing it.
[01:25:52] Gerard Donnelly: When he first started with me, he would always say, don't forget, I've only got one lung.
[01:25:59] Gerard Donnelly: He would always use that.
[01:26:00] Gerard Donnelly: And I eventually said to him, Dan, we have to stop mentioning about your lung.
[01:26:08] Gerard Donnelly: I know you've got one lung.
[01:26:10] Gerard Donnelly: We're accounting for it.
[01:26:13] Gerard Donnelly: And, you know, don't use it as an excuse.
[01:26:16] Gerard Donnelly: And I'm trying not to be uncaring, but there's a point where you want to get coached.
[01:26:25] Gerard Donnelly: If you are struggling because you can't breathe properly, I understand.
[01:26:28] Gerard Donnelly: It's fine.
[01:26:29] Gerard Donnelly: We test you at the level you're at.
[01:26:31] Gerard Donnelly: And when we test you, you've only got one lung.
[01:26:34] Gerard Donnelly: So when you do the training sessions, you've still only got one lung, you know.
[01:26:38] Gerard Donnelly: So I had to get him out of that mindset of I couldn't do the session coach because I've got one lung and it was too hard.
[01:26:46] Gerard Donnelly: And I'd say, well, that's .
[01:26:48] Gerard Donnelly: That's just not true.
[01:26:51] Gerard Donnelly: You know, these are your running numbers.
[01:26:53] Gerard Donnelly: These are your swimming numbers.
[01:26:54] Gerard Donnelly: And these are your bike riding numbers.
[01:26:57] Gerard Donnelly: And so once we got over that, it was.
[01:27:00] Gerard Donnelly: great.
[01:27:00] Gerard Donnelly: And he stopped thinking like that.
[01:27:02] Gerard Donnelly: And now it is what it is.
[01:27:05] Gerard Donnelly: know, here's the numbers and he never mentions it again.
[01:27:08] Gerard Donnelly: So when people, he took time off the program, which shocked me, like about four or five, six weeks ago.
[01:27:15] Gerard Donnelly: He just out of the blue, you know, I was planning for him for his next season.
[01:27:20] Gerard Donnelly: And his improvement's been incredible over the journey.
[01:27:23] Gerard Donnelly: And he's had previous coaches where he hasn't really improved.
[01:27:27] Gerard Donnelly: And so I kind of, I was, I was really surprised that he did this.
[01:27:32] Gerard Donnelly: And, and I tried to talk to him, but he was unavailable.
[01:27:35] Gerard Donnelly: And in the end, I just gave up.
[01:27:37] Gerard Donnelly: I didn't, I didn't try to contact him.
[01:27:38] Gerard Donnelly: And then he's reached out to me last week saying, hey, coach, I want to get back on the program.
[01:27:42] Gerard Donnelly: It was like, and so I looked, I've still got him in TrainingPeak.
[01:27:48] Gerard Donnelly: So I looked at what he's been doing since he stopped.
[01:27:51] Gerard Donnelly: And then he joined Phil Mosley's online program.
[01:27:55] Gerard Donnelly: Yeah.
[01:27:55] Gerard Donnelly: And, and, and that he's getting no attention.
[01:27:58] Gerard Donnelly: Yeah.
[01:28:00] Gerard Donnelly: And so he's tried to do that for two or three weeks, and he's just gone, screw this.
[01:28:04] Gerard Donnelly: I'm going to go back with someone who actually cares about me.
[01:28:08] Gerard Donnelly: But he doesn't know that I haven't taken on a new athlete for two years.
[01:28:14] Gerard Donnelly: That's why I've hired you, and I've hired Paul, and I've hired Nick, and I've hired Matt.
[01:28:19] Gerard Donnelly: Because I don't want to take on new athletes.
[01:28:21] Gerard Donnelly: I want to coach you guys to be a replica of my coaching methods.
[01:28:26] Gerard Donnelly: So when people go off, I try to tell them, if you go off, I won't be your coach when you come back on.
[01:28:33] Gerard Donnelly: But I didn't actually get a conversation with him.
[01:28:37] Gerard Donnelly: So he might have some pushback on this.
[01:28:40] Gerard Donnelly: So you'll be able to handle him no problem whatsoever, Abby.
[01:28:46] Abby Jorgensen: Yeah.
[01:28:47] Gerard Donnelly: But I'm just giving you a bit of a background on who he is.
[01:28:50] Gerard Donnelly: And once you sort of set boundaries, it's like a child.
[01:28:54] Gerard Donnelly: If you set, like a dog, if you set boundaries, the dog knows.
[01:28:58] Abby Jorgensen: And they may not.
[01:29:00] Gerard Donnelly: Yeah, because you're that parent, like some parents, that don't set boundaries properly.
[01:29:06] Abby Jorgensen: Well, for reference, I had this morning, there was a raccoon in the yard and I had to, yeah, I get the dogs out of the backyard.
[01:29:17] Gerard Donnelly: Dogs go crazy.
[01:29:19] Gerard Donnelly: Like we have a similar thing called a possum.
[01:29:21] Gerard Donnelly: Oh, we have those two, yeah.
[01:29:23] Abby Jorgensen: Yeah, we played dead in the yard and I thought it was actually dead and then it wasn't.
[01:29:30] Abby Jorgensen: It was going into survival mode.
[01:29:33] Abby Jorgensen: It was, yeah.
[01:29:35] Gerard Donnelly: Or our dog loses its mind when there's a possum in the tree and you can't reason with it.
[01:29:41] Gerard Donnelly: It is just not listening.
[01:29:44] Abby Jorgensen: It was out in the yard yelling at 6 a.m.
[01:29:46] Abby Jorgensen: I probably woke up the whole neighborhood.
[01:29:48] Gerard Donnelly: Yeah, so look, I don't know where we sit with Dan, but I think I could get you up to the 25 if, you know, I don't want to overload you with so many people, but the fact that you haven't got the gym.
[01:29:59] Gerard Donnelly: But we'll next
[01:30:00] Gerard Donnelly: Starting yet.
[01:30:01] Abby Jorgensen: Yeah, I don't think it, I mean, if anything, you know, I might, you know, try to coach somewhere, but it'd be like minimal, like just enough, like pay for my addiction to endurance sports registration fees.
[01:30:17] Abby Jorgensen: Yes.
[01:30:19] Abby Jorgensen: Or I'm like, food is expensive and I eat a lot.
[01:30:22] Gerard Donnelly: So, um, yeah, and look, we want to, we want to reimburse you enough so that, you know, once, once, once I feel that you're competent, you know, it's not going to be a set fee, Abby, you know, if you can get more than 25, then it's a negotiated fee, then it's not, um, that's, you know, I don't know if Jordan's explained that to you, but if.
[01:30:41] Gerard Donnelly: Well, not really.
[01:30:42] Abby Jorgensen: He said he was at one point, but then we just never connected, I don't think.
[01:30:46] Abby Jorgensen: Yeah.
[01:30:46] Gerard Donnelly: Yeah, so if you keep going the way you are, then, uh, then we would, uh, change your fee structure so that you're not getting paid per athlete, you're getting paid, um, kind of for the job you're doing, um, so hard work.
[01:31:00] Abby Jorgensen: It's the dollar, the U.S.
[01:31:02] Abby Jorgensen: here right now.
[01:31:04] Abby Jorgensen: Yeah.
[01:31:05] Abby Jorgensen: But yeah, I enjoy it.
[01:31:09] Abby Jorgensen: I mean, Nancy still texts me, so if that says anything.
[01:31:14] Abby Jorgensen: Yeah, that's interesting, isn't it?
[01:31:16] Abby Jorgensen: Yeah, she asked me when my next race was and if I could track her or if she could track me.
[01:31:22] Abby Jorgensen: Yeah, she's still messaging.
[01:31:25] Abby Jorgensen: Yeah.
[01:31:26] Gerard Donnelly: So we had the impression that that was it.
[01:31:28] Gerard Donnelly: She's going to do her own thing.
[01:31:30] Gerard Donnelly: Is that, are we right in that?
[01:31:31] Gerard Donnelly: Is that the wrong impression?
[01:31:32] Abby Jorgensen: It sounds, she, I asked her about the nutrition thing and she's doing that course with that Australian, your, your guys' lady, but I don't, I mean, I don't know.
[01:31:43] Abby Jorgensen: She sounds like she's just going to train herself for Eugene, the Oregon Marathon.
[01:31:47] Abby Jorgensen: I don't know.
[01:31:48] Abby Jorgensen: I mean, I still have access to her training peaks and I occasionally look at it just for, to see what she's actually doing.
[01:31:56] Abby Jorgensen: Is she doing anything?
[01:31:57] Abby Jorgensen: She's doing stuff, but.
[01:31:58] Abby Jorgensen: know.
[01:31:59] Abby Jorgensen: I don't She's doing
[01:32:00] Abby Jorgensen: I mean, it's our own version of stuff.
[01:32:08] Abby Jorgensen: Oh, my page has gone blank again.
[01:32:10] Gerard Donnelly: There we go.
[01:32:15] Gerard Donnelly: 5K test.
[01:32:17] Gerard Donnelly: Yeah, she tested herself, it looks like.
[01:32:30] Gerard Donnelly: A bit slower than the last test in May.
[01:32:36] Gerard Donnelly: Okay.
[01:32:37] Abby Jorgensen: I mean, she's not fast.
[01:32:43] Abby Jorgensen: Anyway, if she reaches out, then fine.
[01:32:46] Gerard Donnelly: Yeah.
[01:32:47] Abby Jorgensen: We're not chasing.
[01:32:48] Abby Jorgensen: Yeah.
[01:32:50] Gerard Donnelly: Okay.
[01:32:54] Gerard Donnelly: You're coping with the program?
[01:32:57] Gerard Donnelly: Yeah.
[01:32:59] Abby Jorgensen: Yeah.
[01:33:00] Abby Jorgensen: Yeah, I think that, I mean, I mean, I hit all my numbers this morning.
[01:33:04] Abby Jorgensen: It just felt hard.
[01:33:05] Abby Jorgensen: Yeah.
[01:33:06] Abby Jorgensen: I mean.
[01:33:09] Abby Jorgensen: You're running.
[01:33:10] Gerard Donnelly: How do you feel with your running?
[01:33:12] Abby Jorgensen: I mean, I feel really, I mean, a lot of the stuff is, I try to get outside twice a week.
[01:33:18] Abby Jorgensen: Depends on the, like this Sunday, again, it's supposed to snow and wind chills of, like, in the teens and Fahrenheit.
[01:33:25] Abby Jorgensen: So I don't know what that is Celsius.
[01:33:27] Abby Jorgensen: So we'll see.
[01:33:29] Abby Jorgensen: But I enjoy the threshold runs.
[01:33:34] Abby Jorgensen: Yes, they get more interest, haven't they?
[01:33:37] Abby Jorgensen: Yeah, it just keeps me.
[01:33:42] Abby Jorgensen: Yeah, my last week just felt long.
[01:33:46] Abby Jorgensen: It was never ending, but.
[01:33:48] Abby Jorgensen: Yes.
[01:33:51] Gerard Donnelly: 17 degrees Fahrenheit is minus eight Celsius.
[01:33:55] Abby Jorgensen: Yeah.
[01:33:56] Abby Jorgensen: The wind chills would be cold.
[01:33:57] Gerard Donnelly: I wouldn't be outside, Abby.
[01:33:59] Gerard Donnelly: No, I.
[01:34:00] Abby Jorgensen: I I have a threshold of about 30 degrees Fahrenheit, maybe.
[01:34:05] Abby Jorgensen: Yeah, well, 30 is minus one.
[01:34:08] Gerard Donnelly: So I'm not keen on people training in anything below zero.
[01:34:14] Gerard Donnelly: Yeah, I don't mind the treadmill.
[01:34:15] Abby Jorgensen: I can just put my TV on and go, getting into a good rhythm.
[01:34:20] Gerard Donnelly: And if you feel like it's a better day Saturday, then run Saturday and do the right Sunday.
[01:34:28] Gerard Donnelly: Okay.
[01:34:29] Gerard Donnelly: All right?
[01:34:30] Gerard Donnelly: So if you know the weather's going to be terrible on one of the days, on the weekend, swap them around.
[01:34:36] Gerard Donnelly: Okay?
[01:34:37] Gerard Donnelly: Because we've got you running on, you know, Wednesday and Thursday, and you've got a break.
[01:34:43] Gerard Donnelly: So it doesn't matter when you run on the weekend.
[01:34:46] Gerard Donnelly: Okay?
[01:34:47] Abby Jorgensen: Okay.
[01:34:50] Gerard Donnelly: So, you know, we've got you averaging 50s now, 50-odd K an hour, 50-odd kilometres per week.
[01:34:58] Abby Jorgensen: Thank you.
[01:34:58] Gerard Donnelly: Thank you.
[01:34:58] Gerard Donnelly: you.
[01:34:58] Gerard Donnelly: you.
[01:34:59] Gerard Donnelly: Yeah, I was-
[01:35:00] Abby Jorgensen: I told my friend, I was like, I'm running more now than I was during my Ironman.
[01:35:04] Abby Jorgensen: They're baffled.
[01:35:05] Abby Jorgensen: I was like, it's just how it goes.
[01:35:08] Abby Jorgensen: Yeah.
[01:35:09] Gerard Donnelly: And we want to keep pushing it up.
[01:35:11] Gerard Donnelly: Okay.
[01:35:12] Gerard Donnelly: Yeah.
[01:35:12] Gerard Donnelly: And only two bikes a week.
[01:35:15] Abby Jorgensen: Yeah.
[01:35:15] Abby Jorgensen: Only two.
[01:35:16] Abby Jorgensen: Yeah.
[01:35:17] Gerard Donnelly: So we're kind of all in here on pushing the running.
[01:35:21] Gerard Donnelly: Okay.
[01:35:22] Abby Jorgensen: Yep.
[01:35:23] Gerard Donnelly: We'll use the ride as a long ride and one intensity ride.
[01:35:27] Gerard Donnelly: Okay.
[01:35:28] Gerard Donnelly: Okay.
[01:35:28] Gerard Donnelly: And if we wanted to, on another day, we could just do recovery, you know, 50 watts, easy pedaling, 20 minutes, just sitting there.
[01:35:39] Gerard Donnelly: You could be texting if you wanted to on the bike where you're just getting blood flow.
[01:35:44] Gerard Donnelly: It's not an aerobic fitness gain.
[01:35:47] Gerard Donnelly: It's recovery blood flow.
[01:35:50] Gerard Donnelly: So just getting the blood to go around your legs.
[01:35:52] Gerard Donnelly: And it's less impacting than walking.
[01:35:55] Gerard Donnelly: And, you know, 15, 20, 25 minutes of that is absolutely.
[01:36:00] Gerard Donnelly: It's something if you wanted to do, you could do, all right?
[01:36:05] Abby Jorgensen: I'm sorry.
[01:36:06] Abby Jorgensen: I'm just not talking.
[01:36:08] Abby Jorgensen: They're like, it's dinners.
[01:36:10] Abby Jorgensen: That's the thing with Daylight Savings Time.
[01:36:12] Abby Jorgensen: They think they need fed an hour early.
[01:36:15] Abby Jorgensen: Oh, they're right.
[01:36:18] Abby Jorgensen: Yeah, it's like a thing because it's, yeah, they're so used to being fed at a time and then you take your clocks an hour back and they don't know the difference.
[01:36:27] Abby Jorgensen: Yeah, they're to, their clock is really, that's incredible.
[01:36:32] Abby Jorgensen: They're very routine.
[01:36:33] Abby Jorgensen: I'm a very routine person.
[01:36:34] Abby Jorgensen: So if I get out of routine, they'll let me know.
[01:36:38] Abby Jorgensen: Yeah.
[01:36:41] Abby Jorgensen: All right.
[01:36:42] Abby Jorgensen: I'll let you go.
[01:36:44] Abby Jorgensen: All right.
[01:36:45] Abby Jorgensen: Okay.
[01:36:46] Gerard Donnelly: So you could reach out to Sin now.
[01:36:50] Gerard Donnelly: Okay.
[01:36:50] Gerard Donnelly: He's Switzerland, so seven hours, I think.
[01:36:55] Gerard Donnelly: So just leave a message for him saying, hey, it's Abby, I want to catch up with you.
[01:37:00] Gerard Donnelly: I'll also text him.
[01:37:02] Abby Jorgensen: Okay.
[01:37:02] Abby Jorgensen: Yep.
[01:37:03] Abby Jorgensen: He seemed like a good guy.
[01:37:07] Abby Jorgensen: Yeah, he's really keen.
[01:37:08] Abby Jorgensen: think he's, isn't that, that's, Zurich is where Coco's at, right?
[01:37:12] Abby Jorgensen: Yes, a similar place, yeah.
[01:37:15] Abby Jorgensen: So.
[01:37:16] Abby Jorgensen: Maybe we can't help him.
[01:37:17] Abby Jorgensen: Yep.
[01:37:18] Abby Jorgensen: Okay.
[01:37:19] Abby Jorgensen: All right.
[01:37:20] Abby Jorgensen: All right.
[01:37:21] Abby Jorgensen: See you.
[01:37:22] Abby Jorgensen: Bye.
[01:37:30] Abby Jorgensen: Bye.
