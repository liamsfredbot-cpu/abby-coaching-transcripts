## Transcript

[00:00:00] Abby Jorgensen: A little sore, I think, from actually running outside.
[00:00:04] Abby Jorgensen: Yes, okay.
[00:00:05] Gerard Donnelly: Isn't that interesting?
[00:00:06] Gerard Donnelly: Yeah.
[00:00:08] Gerard Donnelly: It's been a while since you've had a run outside, isn't it?
[00:00:11] Gerard Donnelly: Yeah, Thanksgiving, that 5k outside, but yeah.
[00:00:15] Abby Jorgensen: Yeah.
[00:00:17] Gerard Donnelly: It's interesting how when you're on the treadmill, you're landing on the same position every time, and when you're running outside, the camber of the footpath or road, it's just a different landing spot.
[00:00:31] Gerard Donnelly: And it's almost like you get doms, isn't it?
[00:00:34] Abby Jorgensen: Yeah, it was weird.
[00:00:35] Abby Jorgensen: mean, maybe the back-to-back, the threshold run, but what's the long, I don't know.
[00:00:41] Gerard Donnelly: Yeah.
[00:00:42] Gerard Donnelly: Are they sore injury or sore doms?
[00:00:45] Gerard Donnelly: Just sore doms, yeah.
[00:00:47] Abby Jorgensen: Yeah.
[00:00:48] Abby Jorgensen: Okay.
[00:00:49] Abby Jorgensen: That's like the only thing that ever gets sore on me is my calves.
[00:00:53] Abby Jorgensen: Yeah.
[00:00:57] Gerard Donnelly: Can you self-message your calves?
[00:00:58] Gerard Donnelly: Have you got a massage gun?
[00:00:59] Gerard Donnelly: Yeah.
[00:00:59] Gerard Donnelly: I have the compression boots.
[00:01:03] Gerard Donnelly: Do you get a massage much?
[00:01:06] Gerard Donnelly: No.
[00:01:07] Abby Jorgensen: Probably should do more, but I just don't.
[00:01:11] Gerard Donnelly: No, that's okay.
[00:01:15] Abby Jorgensen: No, really good stuff.
[00:01:17] Gerard Donnelly: The Threshold Run on Saturday was really hard of that feeling when you're on those 430s.
[00:01:25] Gerard Donnelly: That's really good.
[00:01:26] Abby Jorgensen: Yeah, I mean, they felt a lot easier than it felt on the treadmill.
[00:01:29] Abby Jorgensen: That's for sure.
[00:01:31] Abby Jorgensen: Yeah.
[00:01:32] Gerard Donnelly: Yeah.
[00:01:33] Gerard Donnelly: And your heart rate's getting up to the 170s, so, which is...
[00:01:38] Abby Jorgensen: I feel like it.
[00:01:39] Abby Jorgensen: I mean, it felt...
[00:01:41] Abby Jorgensen: I mean, the first 4 felt pretty...
[00:01:44] Abby Jorgensen: Yeah.
[00:01:46] Gerard Donnelly: Yeah.
[00:01:49] Gerard Donnelly: The heel repeats on the treadmill.
[00:01:51] Gerard Donnelly: Is that causing a little bit of strain on the calf?
[00:01:55] Abby Jorgensen: Oh, I mean, my calves felt fine up until this morning when I woke up.
[00:02:00] Abby Jorgensen: Yeah, okay.
[00:02:01] Gerard Donnelly: Yeah, that was from yesterday's run.
[00:02:04] Abby Jorgensen: Yeah.
[00:02:08] Gerard Donnelly: Well, for tomorrow, if you're still sore, we probably should do an easier run there.
[00:02:17] Gerard Donnelly: So you can't start compounding the soreness so that you don't ever lose the soreness.
[00:02:22] Gerard Donnelly: You've got to, yeah, we'll see how you go.
[00:02:27] Abby Jorgensen: Yeah, can see how I, because I'll probably have to do that one on the treadmill just because of time constraints tomorrow in the morning, so.
[00:02:39] Gerard Donnelly: Any opportunities, if you feel like you can get outside, whilst you've got the soreness in your calves, it's probably better on the treadmill anyway.
[00:02:46] Gerard Donnelly: But just so that you don't have this, you know, soreness thing, do your best.
[00:02:54] Gerard Donnelly: I know you will, if you can, and the weather's okay, just try to get outside.
[00:02:59] Gerard Donnelly: try get outside.
[00:02:59] Gerard Donnelly: I the the the I I
[00:03:00] Gerard Donnelly: How are you running shoes?
[00:03:02] Abby Jorgensen: They're good.
[00:03:03] Abby Jorgensen: I just got some new daily trainers.
[00:03:06] Abby Jorgensen: Yeah.
[00:03:10] Gerard Donnelly: No, that's really good.
[00:03:12] Gerard Donnelly: What have you got planned for Christmas Day?
[00:03:14] Gerard Donnelly: Have you got anything?
[00:03:16] Gerard Donnelly: Nothing.
[00:03:17] Abby Jorgensen: I'm going to drive to my parents, which it's 90 minutes to Iowa City.
[00:03:22] Abby Jorgensen: And then my sister lives there, too.
[00:03:23] Abby Jorgensen: So we just do Christmas that day.
[00:03:26] Abby Jorgensen: Can you run?
[00:03:28] Gerard Donnelly: Can you ride or run?
[00:03:29] Gerard Donnelly: Yeah, I'll ride.
[00:03:30] Abby Jorgensen: I'll just get up in the morning.
[00:03:32] Abby Jorgensen: I don't have to be there till noontime.
[00:03:35] Abby Jorgensen: Perfect.
[00:03:36] Abby Jorgensen: Okay.
[00:03:37] Abby Jorgensen: Not a problem.
[00:03:39] Gerard Donnelly: So after week one, did you feel okay fatigue-wise?
[00:03:44] Gerard Donnelly: Yeah.
[00:03:45] Abby Jorgensen: The Thursday-Friday felt like fine.
[00:03:50] Abby Jorgensen: I mean, the 20-minute run was nothing on Friday.
[00:03:54] Abby Jorgensen: So, yeah.
[00:03:55] Abby Jorgensen: Yeah.
[00:03:56] Gerard Donnelly: Well, it's good, Abby.
[00:03:57] Gerard Donnelly: We're getting, you know, 64 kilometres, which is...
[00:04:02] Gerard Donnelly: We want to keep building that, you know, we need to get that into the 70s to the 80s.
[00:04:08] Gerard Donnelly: So just by gradually increasing the run, you know, just another 10 or 15 minutes and same with the warm-up in the hill repeats, just adding more time and trying to hover around that long run if you can.
[00:04:27] Gerard Donnelly: So, yeah, just adding a little bit each week just to get your volume up if you can.
[00:04:37] Gerard Donnelly: Anything else on what's happening in the next month or so?
[00:04:42] Gerard Donnelly: Anything?
[00:04:43] Gerard Donnelly: Nothing major, I don't think.
[00:04:46] Abby Jorgensen: No, January is pretty quiet.
[00:04:49] Abby Jorgensen: Excellent.
[00:04:49] Gerard Donnelly: Okay.
[00:04:50] Gerard Donnelly: Random weather, but...
[00:04:53] Abby Jorgensen: The weather gets worse, does it?
[00:04:54] Abby Jorgensen: I mean, it's just hard to tell.
[00:04:56] Abby Jorgensen: mean, like, this week, I mean, it's supposed to be 60 degrees on Christmas Day.
[00:04:59] Abby Jorgensen: Like...
[00:05:00] Abby Jorgensen: I don't know.
[00:05:03] Gerard Donnelly: Well, yesterday here, it's supposed to be 25, which is, you know, 60 or 70 degrees for you, 80 degrees.
[00:05:15] Gerard Donnelly: And it was 13.
[00:05:19] Abby Jorgensen: I'm freezing.
[00:05:21] Gerard Donnelly: It's just so.
[00:05:22] Abby Jorgensen: Yeah, I mean, it's 52 right now, it says.
[00:05:26] Abby Jorgensen: So that's, don't know what that is in Celsius.
[00:05:27] Gerard Donnelly: Yeah, well, we had 37 last Thursday, then we had 17.
[00:05:32] Gerard Donnelly: So it was a 20 degree swing, which is like 50 degrees in Fahrenheit.
[00:05:38] Abby Jorgensen: Yeah, I mean, when we go from negative 20 windchill to 40 degrees, that's a 60.
[00:05:42] Abby Jorgensen: Yeah.
[00:05:45] Gerard Donnelly: Okay, how's Abby going?
[00:05:46] Gerard Donnelly: How's Coco going, Abby?
[00:05:50] Abby Jorgensen: She, that Tuesday, she woke up and wasn't, like, she just felt very fatigued.
[00:05:56] Abby Jorgensen: Like, we, the rest of the week, I took that.
[00:06:02] Gerard Donnelly: Yeah, 5,000 meters of climbing, 340 and 44.
[00:06:09] Abby Jorgensen: In the week before, yeah, I was like, so, I mean, I haven't talked with her again about, like, not adding anything to her, to her stuff.
[00:06:23] Gerard Donnelly: How's her running legs feeling?
[00:06:26] Gerard Donnelly: Her legs feel fine.
[00:06:27] Abby Jorgensen: She says it's been, like, her gut, and she's had some other weird issues going on, just feeling fatigued and tired.
[00:06:35] Abby Jorgensen: Yeah.
[00:06:37] Gerard Donnelly: Yeah.
[00:06:38] Gerard Donnelly: Well, she's gone, you she hasn't done a lot of running issues, so 11 kilometers.
[00:06:44] Abby Jorgensen: Yeah, the running, she says, fine for the most part.
[00:06:48] Abby Jorgensen: I almost took away the run yesterday, because, depending on how she was feeling, but then she said she woke up and felt fine, and the run felt fine, so.
[00:06:57] Abby Jorgensen: Yeah.
[00:06:58] Gerard Donnelly: Yeah.
[00:06:59] Abby Jorgensen: Yeah.
[00:07:02] Abby Jorgensen: Yeah, okay.
[00:07:09] Gerard Donnelly: Yeah, well, you know, she's doing a great job so far.
[00:07:13] Gerard Donnelly: There's a lot of big days there.
[00:07:15] Gerard Donnelly: Yeah.
[00:07:16] Abby Jorgensen: I mean, I told her as much as possible, mean, as much as possible, just keep the stress down and don't do anything extra.
[00:07:25] Abby Jorgensen: Yeah.
[00:07:27] Gerard Donnelly: If there's no reason that she can't run, she needs to be more consistent with the running, okay?
[00:07:34] Gerard Donnelly: Okay.
[00:07:35] Gerard Donnelly: So I would rather she didn't do an hour 25.
[00:07:38] Gerard Donnelly: I'd rather she did, you know, 45 minutes, 45 minutes, you know, 30 minutes and another 50 minutes.
[00:07:46] Gerard Donnelly: That way she's going to at least get, you know, 30 kilometers in.
[00:07:52] Gerard Donnelly: But, yeah, we've got to build her body to cope with the load rather than, you know.
[00:08:00] Gerard Donnelly: I would even probably get rid of all the hill repeats, although they're the least impactful.
[00:08:10] Gerard Donnelly: But we just wanted to be consistent, Abby, with the running.
[00:08:15] Gerard Donnelly: This week's great.
[00:08:16] Gerard Donnelly: If she does those four runs, that's perfect.
[00:08:18] Abby Jorgensen: I think we had it, but then last week when she came up with so much fatigue, we took out some stuff.
[00:08:27] Gerard Donnelly: Yeah.
[00:08:30] Gerard Donnelly: Anyway.
[00:08:31] Gerard Donnelly: Yeah.
[00:08:35] Gerard Donnelly: Good stuff.
[00:08:36] Gerard Donnelly: Yeah.
[00:08:37] Gerard Donnelly: I think she said she felt, I talked to her earlier, she said she felt fine right now.
[00:08:42] Abby Jorgensen: Good.
[00:08:44] Gerard Donnelly: Your program's really good.
[00:08:47] Gerard Donnelly: That's exactly what she should be having.
[00:08:49] Gerard Donnelly: But the key is that we've got to get the running to be, you know, at least 30 kilometers every week, moving into 40, you know.
[00:08:56] Gerard Donnelly: She can't have 22, know, 11, nine.
[00:08:59] Gerard Donnelly: You
[00:09:01] Gerard Donnelly: Unless there's an injury and if she's too tired, bloody ride less, you know, you've got to have her running.
[00:09:10] Gerard Donnelly: Consistency, consistency of running is really important.
[00:09:15] Gerard Donnelly: Okay, Dougie?
[00:09:18] Gerard Donnelly: Um, I don't know.
[00:09:20] Abby Jorgensen: Last week in Dubai, he didn't do anything.
[00:09:23] Abby Jorgensen: Um, so, I mean, I talked to him last week at some point.
[00:09:27] Abby Jorgensen: And so, I don't know, this week will probably be all over too with Christmas, he said.
[00:09:32] Abby Jorgensen: So, I just tried to program some stuff.
[00:09:34] Abby Jorgensen: And if he had time, he'd do it.
[00:09:40] Gerard Donnelly: Yeah.
[00:09:41] Gerard Donnelly: He's a weird one.
[00:09:42] Abby Jorgensen: Yeah.
[00:09:43] Abby Jorgensen: I mean, every time I talked to him, he's super motivated.
[00:09:45] Abby Jorgensen: then, like, doesn't do anything.
[00:09:48] Abby Jorgensen: Like, it's in a way.
[00:09:49] Abby Jorgensen: Yeah.
[00:09:50] Abby Jorgensen: Yeah.
[00:09:50] Gerard Donnelly: Well, I think, just have a little chat to him about, uh, uh, you know, the doctor's appointment syndrome where, you know, make a day, you know.
[00:10:00] Gerard Donnelly: A time where you're going to train, you know, you've got an appointment to train and plan it and don't let the day go.
[00:10:07] Gerard Donnelly: I'm going to do that later.
[00:10:08] Gerard Donnelly: I'm going to do that later.
[00:10:09] Gerard Donnelly: That doesn't work ever for the people like him.
[00:10:12] Gerard Donnelly: He'll just let the day go.
[00:10:14] Gerard Donnelly: So, you know, do you train either seven o'clock in the morning or six o'clock at night or whatever, but make an appointment with that time.
[00:10:23] Gerard Donnelly: Yeah.
[00:10:24] Abby Jorgensen: The biggest thing with him is trying to find, like, that right balance between him doing high rocks and him doing all his other stuff too.
[00:10:33] Gerard Donnelly: But he's really not doing a lot of other stuff, you know?
[00:10:38] Abby Jorgensen: Yeah.
[00:10:40] Gerard Donnelly: He's got a whole week there where he's, two weeks where he's done nothing.
[00:10:44] Gerard Donnelly: Yeah, unless he did stuff and just didn't record it.
[00:10:47] Abby Jorgensen: That's right.
[00:10:49] Abby Jorgensen: Yeah.
[00:10:51] Gerard Donnelly: Andrew?
[00:10:52] Abby Jorgensen: Andrew's good.
[00:10:54] Abby Jorgensen: I'm trying to think what...
[00:10:57] Abby Jorgensen: I mean, yeah, he's good.
[00:10:58] Abby Jorgensen: He got to run outside as well.
[00:11:00] Abby Jorgensen: Well, yesterday he messaged me.
[00:11:03] Abby Jorgensen: Have you met Andy, Abby?
[00:11:04] Abby Jorgensen: No, hello.
[00:11:05] Abby Jorgensen: not.
[00:11:06] Abby Jorgensen: Hi.
[00:11:07] Abby Jorgensen: Happy Christmas.
[00:11:08] Abby Jorgensen: Yes, Merry Christmas yourself.
[00:11:10] Abby Jorgensen: Thank you.
[00:11:11] Gerard Donnelly: Have a great time.
[00:11:13] Abby Jorgensen: Thank you.
[00:11:15] Gerard Donnelly: Sorry, what did you say then, Abby?
[00:11:18] Abby Jorgensen: He got to run outside as well yesterday for the first time in a while.
[00:11:22] Abby Jorgensen: Right.
[00:11:23] Abby Jorgensen: Yeah, he said he negative split the run or something.
[00:11:27] Abby Jorgensen: Yep.
[00:11:27] Abby Jorgensen: But it was a little colder there than here.
[00:11:31] Abby Jorgensen: They always get the R weather like a day later.
[00:11:34] Abby Jorgensen: Yeah.
[00:11:35] Abby Jorgensen: Where's he?
[00:11:36] Abby Jorgensen: Indiana.
[00:11:37] Abby Jorgensen: So like two states away.
[00:11:40] Abby Jorgensen: It looks like he ran indoors.
[00:11:44] Gerard Donnelly: That's the Apple Watch.
[00:11:45] Abby Jorgensen: It's so weird.
[00:11:46] Abby Jorgensen: It doesn't do GPS good.
[00:11:48] Abby Jorgensen: I can show you the GPS.
[00:11:51] Gerard Donnelly: Yeah.
[00:11:52] Gerard Donnelly: You happy with his – he's just starting to get the program going again.
[00:11:59] Gerard Donnelly: you.
[00:11:59] Abby Jorgensen: you.
[00:11:59] Abby Jorgensen: you.
[00:12:00] Abby Jorgensen: Yeah, once next week gets over with, we'll kind of go back to a full program for at least five days a week, or seven days a week, which is five.
[00:12:12] Gerard Donnelly: How's Tim going?
[00:12:15] Gerard Donnelly: He's good.
[00:12:17] Abby Jorgensen: I mean, this week, he's, next two weeks, he's in the mountains, so he'll probably, I told him if we need to move things around, we can, so it just depends.
[00:12:34] Gerard Donnelly: He's pretty compliant, isn't he?
[00:12:36] Gerard Donnelly: Yeah, mean, he's really compliant, unless something pops up with work.
[00:12:40] Abby Jorgensen: Yeah, besides the, like, he's already cross-country skied today, so, I don't know.
[00:12:49] Gerard Donnelly: Yeah, that's quite taxing, Abby, so, you know, really be, be encouraging, that's fantastic if he's doing cross-country skiing.
[00:12:59] Gerard Donnelly: He's, like,
[00:13:00] Gerard Donnelly: Is there a hotel gym where he is?
[00:13:03] Abby Jorgensen: I think he's like, like it's a house or something, like whether it's his parents or his girlfriend's parents, I can't remember.
[00:13:12] Gerard Donnelly: Yeah, during this week, yeah, as long as he's out there doing something.
[00:13:19] Gerard Donnelly: And look, if he's in week one here and he ends up coming back home, make this week two.
[00:13:26] Gerard Donnelly: You know, kind of, if he's doing not much writing this week, then start his second week here.
[00:13:37] Abby Jorgensen: Yeah, I think he's there until the third, I think.
[00:13:40] Abby Jorgensen: Yes, okay.
[00:13:41] Abby Jorgensen: I told him to resume week two.
[00:13:44] Gerard Donnelly: Yes, here on the fifth.
[00:13:47] Gerard Donnelly: Yep, yep, great.
[00:13:49] Gerard Donnelly: All right, John?
[00:13:51] Abby Jorgensen: Um, he, I talked to him today, he's going to send an email and he's going to cancel because of, he just can't afford it anymore.
[00:13:59] Gerard Donnelly: I know.
[00:14:02] Abby Jorgensen: He's like, it's nothing to do, he enjoyed it, he just, he's like, now after I got on the Key West, I have no money, and I was like, well, that happens.
[00:14:13] Abby Jorgensen: Yep, okay.
[00:14:16] Abby Jorgensen: I told him to send an email to Floyd and then you, so.
[00:14:20] Gerard Donnelly: and Jordan, mainly, it's mainly to Jordan.
[00:14:22] Gerard Donnelly: Okay.
[00:14:23] Abby Jorgensen: Good.
[00:14:24] Gerard Donnelly: All three, actually.
[00:14:28] Gerard Donnelly: I know, we almost get there and then somebody.
[00:14:31] Abby Jorgensen: I know.
[00:14:33] Gerard Donnelly: I felt like with him from the beginning, it was kind of like, I don't know.
[00:14:37] Abby Jorgensen: Yeah, me too.
[00:14:38] Abby Jorgensen: He's young and, yeah.
[00:14:40] Abby Jorgensen: Yeah.
[00:14:42] Gerard Donnelly: Yeah, it was not a long-term thing.
[00:14:44] Abby Jorgensen: Yeah, I just felt like it was try to get him through this triathlon, see what, he enjoys it or not.
[00:14:52] Abby Jorgensen: Yeah, yep.
[00:14:53] Gerard Donnelly: But, I'm trying to see who's coming up with interviews.
[00:14:59] Gerard Donnelly: see comes up
[00:15:00] Gerard Donnelly: We've tried to kind of cancel just to give me a break from a week.
[00:15:04] Abby Jorgensen: Yeah, thought like the last podcast said that you guys just kept on holiday.
[00:15:08] Abby Jorgensen: I remember that last year.
[00:15:11] Gerard Donnelly: Yeah.
[00:15:12] Gerard Donnelly: A lot of the, there's a lot of Australian applications, not a lot of the US, maybe probably because it's in the middle of winter.
[00:15:23] Gerard Donnelly: Yeah.
[00:15:24] Gerard Donnelly: Might be the reason, but yeah.
[00:15:30] Gerard Donnelly: Um, not to worry.
[00:15:35] Gerard Donnelly: All right.
[00:15:36] Gerard Donnelly: Chris.
[00:15:38] Abby Jorgensen: This is really compliant as well.
[00:15:41] Abby Jorgensen: Um, he's in the mountains this week or in Colorado.
[00:15:44] Abby Jorgensen: So, um, he's the one that I took, took his intensity down for this week a little bit.
[00:15:50] Abby Jorgensen: He's going to ride Peloton.
[00:15:52] Abby Jorgensen: Yes.
[00:15:53] Gerard Donnelly: Okay.
[00:15:53] Gerard Donnelly: Okay.
[00:15:53] Gerard Donnelly: Yep.
[00:15:55] Abby Jorgensen: with, with his pedals, but I took the intensity down and.
[00:15:58] Abby Jorgensen: Good.
[00:15:58] Abby Jorgensen: Yep.
[00:15:58] Abby Jorgensen: Okay.
[00:15:59] Abby Jorgensen: So.
[00:16:00] Abby Jorgensen: He doesn't really have a pool either.
[00:16:02] Abby Jorgensen: He might have one Wednesday, so put one in and then do it.
[00:16:06] Abby Jorgensen: can do it.
[00:16:08] Abby Jorgensen: Yep.
[00:16:09] Abby Jorgensen: Okay.
[00:16:09] Gerard Donnelly: And he'll be back home the following week or will he?
[00:16:12] Gerard Donnelly: He'll be back home.
[00:16:13] Abby Jorgensen: So.
[00:16:14] Abby Jorgensen: Yep.
[00:16:15] Gerard Donnelly: Yep.
[00:16:15] Gerard Donnelly: Resume.
[00:16:16] Gerard Donnelly: We're going to redo week three.
[00:16:18] Abby Jorgensen: Yes.
[00:16:19] Abby Jorgensen: Okay.
[00:16:19] Abby Jorgensen: Yeah.
[00:16:21] Abby Jorgensen: Yeah.
[00:16:22] Gerard Donnelly: Yep.
[00:16:23] Gerard Donnelly: And then testing.
[00:16:24] Gerard Donnelly: Good.
[00:16:24] Gerard Donnelly: Okay.
[00:16:25] Gerard Donnelly: Very good.
[00:16:26] Gerard Donnelly: Yeah.
[00:16:27] Gerard Donnelly: I tried to work ahead a little bit with the holiday.
[00:16:30] Abby Jorgensen: Yep.
[00:16:31] Gerard Donnelly: How's Kevin going?
[00:16:33] Gerard Donnelly: He's pretty compliant as well.
[00:16:35] Abby Jorgensen: I don't know.
[00:16:35] Abby Jorgensen: He said the next few days might be a little hard depending on activities and stuff, but.
[00:16:44] Abby Jorgensen: He's just started a new block.
[00:16:46] Gerard Donnelly: He's just going leaps and bounds, isn't he?
[00:16:48] Gerard Donnelly: Look, he started at 229.
[00:16:50] Gerard Donnelly: Now he's at 300.
[00:16:52] Gerard Donnelly: Yeah.
[00:16:52] Abby Jorgensen: He just did another FTP last week and another 10 watts.
[00:16:55] Abby Jorgensen: So.
[00:16:56] Abby Jorgensen: Yep.
[00:16:57] Abby Jorgensen: Yep.
[00:16:57] Abby Jorgensen: But we're getting closer to.
[00:16:59] Abby Jorgensen: Let's
[00:17:00] Abby Jorgensen: Like, I think his actual threshold now.
[00:17:02] Abby Jorgensen: Yes, and he's able to run a little bit more?
[00:17:06] Abby Jorgensen: Yeah, just, I mean, yeah, whatever the physio tells me he can handle, I just throw it there.
[00:17:11] Abby Jorgensen: Yep.
[00:17:14] Gerard Donnelly: Yep.
[00:17:16] Gerard Donnelly: Again, like, is the physio saying just two runs, is he?
[00:17:21] Gerard Donnelly: He, she, three runs?
[00:17:23] Abby Jorgensen: We had three runs in there.
[00:17:24] Abby Jorgensen: He missed one, looks like something.
[00:17:27] Gerard Donnelly: Yep.
[00:17:31] Gerard Donnelly: Yep, okay.
[00:17:32] Gerard Donnelly: And so, if he's missing, you know, again, unless you're injured, you've got to start to get your body used to the load.
[00:17:42] Gerard Donnelly: Otherwise, you can't progress.
[00:17:45] Gerard Donnelly: So, try to make that a priority in your conversation with him.
[00:17:50] Gerard Donnelly: You know, it's, it's really weird that he's giving him a 20-minute run at 7%.
[00:17:57] Gerard Donnelly: That's what the physio told him.
[00:17:59] Abby Jorgensen: I know.
[00:18:00] Abby Jorgensen: I know.
[00:18:01] Abby Jorgensen: I found it weird, too.
[00:18:02] Abby Jorgensen: I was like, that'd be horrible, actually, I think.
[00:18:06] Abby Jorgensen: I mean, I do mine at 6% for two to three minutes, and I'm done.
[00:18:11] Abby Jorgensen: I'm going to ask Andrew.
[00:18:16] Gerard Donnelly: Matt's a physio.
[00:18:17] Gerard Donnelly: Andrew's a physio.
[00:18:18] Gerard Donnelly: My son, Matt, is also a physio.
[00:18:20] Gerard Donnelly: My other son, Liam, is a physio.
[00:18:22] Gerard Donnelly: I've never heard anybody do that as a return to running.
[00:18:28] Gerard Donnelly: What was his injury?
[00:18:29] Gerard Donnelly: I think it was something with the tibialis, so.
[00:18:32] Abby Jorgensen: Yes.
[00:18:33] Abby Jorgensen: So maybe it keeps it from, like, full.
[00:18:37] Abby Jorgensen: Yeah.
[00:18:40] Abby Jorgensen: Yeah, I don't know.
[00:18:41] Abby Jorgensen: Yeah, I've never heard of that before, either.
[00:18:52] Gerard Donnelly: I'm just going to make a note.
[00:18:57] Abby Jorgensen: Yeah, I mean, I feel like I've, I know a lot of
[00:19:00] Abby Jorgensen: Physios, and I've talked to a lot of them, and I don't know, that just doesn't seem.
[00:19:04] Abby Jorgensen: No.
[00:19:08] Abby Jorgensen: I'm not going to question it.
[00:19:09] Abby Jorgensen: No, we can't.
[00:19:11] Abby Jorgensen: We have to trust the process.
[00:19:12] Gerard Donnelly: But what we want to do is not have him miss any sessions when he's only doing three of them.
[00:19:18] Abby Jorgensen: Yeah, he did warn me that the weekend and the next few days into Christmas, we're going to be a little all over the place.
[00:19:26] Gerard Donnelly: But, you know, Abby, 20 minutes.
[00:19:31] Gerard Donnelly: You and I would go, 20 minutes, well, let's do it.
[00:19:34] Gerard Donnelly: I know.
[00:19:35] Gerard Donnelly: When I saw 20 minutes, I was like, really?
[00:19:37] Abby Jorgensen: That's it?
[00:19:38] Abby Jorgensen: Yep.
[00:19:39] Gerard Donnelly: But the method is start there and just progress.
[00:19:45] Gerard Donnelly: It's just adding another session.
[00:19:47] Gerard Donnelly: 20 minutes is still significant, even though for someone who's running two hours, it's really small.
[00:19:51] Gerard Donnelly: But it's still load.
[00:19:54] Gerard Donnelly: You're just used to such long training sessions.
[00:19:57] Abby Jorgensen: Yeah.
[00:19:58] Abby Jorgensen: Young.
[00:19:59] Gerard Donnelly: Thank you.
[00:20:00] Gerard Donnelly: Richard's going well, as usual.
[00:20:02] Gerard Donnelly: Yep.
[00:20:02] Abby Jorgensen: He's going to be in Austin this weekend or this week.
[00:20:07] Abby Jorgensen: So we're going to try to do the best we can.
[00:20:11] Abby Jorgensen: Yep.
[00:20:14] Gerard Donnelly: Great.
[00:20:16] Gerard Donnelly: All right.
[00:20:20] Gerard Donnelly: Just looking up his testing.
[00:20:28] Gerard Donnelly: He dropped back a bit last month, didn't he?
[00:20:30] Gerard Donnelly: He wasn't feeling well, I think.
[00:20:33] Abby Jorgensen: That was.
[00:20:34] Abby Jorgensen: Yeah.
[00:20:36] Gerard Donnelly: Yep.
[00:20:36] Gerard Donnelly: Okay.
[00:20:37] Gerard Donnelly: Good.
[00:20:39] Gerard Donnelly: Michaela?
[00:20:41] Gerard Donnelly: She's doing well.
[00:20:47] Abby Jorgensen: Yeah, she's getting her bike fit tomorrow.
[00:20:50] Abby Jorgensen: She got a TT bike.
[00:20:52] Abby Jorgensen: Oh, fantastic.
[00:20:55] Gerard Donnelly: What did she, what did she buy?
[00:20:57] Gerard Donnelly: Uh, I can't remember.
[00:20:59] Abby Jorgensen: can't remember.
[00:21:00] Abby Jorgensen: I'd never heard of it before, but I remember she sent me a picture a long time ago when she ordered it quite a while ago.
[00:21:08] Abby Jorgensen: Yep.
[00:21:10] Abby Jorgensen: Has she been riding it, Abby?
[00:21:14] Abby Jorgensen: It just got put together at the bike shop yesterday.
[00:21:17] Abby Jorgensen: Yes.
[00:21:18] Gerard Donnelly: So remember, this is a new bike, a new bike fit.
[00:21:22] Gerard Donnelly: Is it power pedals that she's transferred?
[00:21:25] Abby Jorgensen: I believe it's like a new power everything.
[00:21:28] Abby Jorgensen: So I told her we need to test.
[00:21:30] Abby Jorgensen: I think next week, sir.
[00:21:32] Abby Jorgensen: It's next week or next week.
[00:21:34] Abby Jorgensen: Yeah.
[00:21:35] Abby Jorgensen: Yeah.
[00:21:38] Gerard Donnelly: Maybe you'll have to have a text message saying, hey, if you're on the TT bike, we probably shouldn't do that session because brand new bike, brand new position.
[00:21:50] Gerard Donnelly: We probably should do something like zone two, Abby, and I would do that.
[00:22:01] Gerard Donnelly: Because the power meter might read way higher or way lower, and she's in a different position.
[00:22:06] Gerard Donnelly: She might not be able to push the same power.
[00:22:08] Gerard Donnelly: We don't want her to fail sessions because she's changed bikes and power meters.
[00:22:13] Gerard Donnelly: So I would be saying to her, hey, discuss it with Gerard.
[00:22:17] Gerard Donnelly: We need to make Tuesday, Thursday session a little practice on your new bike.
[00:22:24] Gerard Donnelly: Just do maybe zone two and some of that sub-threshold stuff.
[00:22:30] Gerard Donnelly: Maybe, maybe, maybe the four-step one, maybe something like that, where she's got a little, it's a little bit less intensity.
[00:22:44] Gerard Donnelly: And if she finds that these are too hard, then let her drop, yeah, tell her, drop the power.
[00:22:49] Gerard Donnelly: It's a new bike.
[00:22:50] Gerard Donnelly: We haven't tested you.
[00:22:52] Gerard Donnelly: Now, ideally, we should test her straight away.
[00:22:54] Gerard Donnelly: But I don't like doing a 20-minute test when you haven't ridden a bike before.
[00:22:58] Gerard Donnelly: So...
[00:22:59] Gerard Donnelly: And...
[00:23:04] Gerard Donnelly: So, she's in New Zealand at the moment, isn't she?
[00:23:07] Abby Jorgensen: Yeah.
[00:23:08] Abby Jorgensen: I know she was with her, I don't know, niece at the park right now or something?
[00:23:14] Abby Jorgensen: don't know.
[00:23:14] Abby Jorgensen: Yeah.
[00:23:15] Abby Jorgensen: Okay.
[00:23:15] Gerard Donnelly: So I'll quickly change that in case she's doing the bike fit because it's Tuesday there, obviously.
[00:23:24] Gerard Donnelly: Yeah, it's up today, she said.
[00:23:31] Gerard Donnelly: The next ride she does, next week, that's fine what you've done there.
[00:23:38] Gerard Donnelly: That's great.
[00:23:43] Gerard Donnelly: Okay.
[00:23:43] Gerard Donnelly: So I'll put the zone two for her today after she does a bike fit.
[00:23:47] Gerard Donnelly: Okay.
[00:23:49] Gerard Donnelly: I mean, just say Tuesday when I'm talking to you.
[00:23:52] Abby Jorgensen: That's fine.
[00:23:53] Abby Jorgensen: Sometimes I don't know what day it is either.
[00:23:55] Abby Jorgensen: fine.
[00:23:55] Abby Jorgensen: Yeah.
[00:23:56] Gerard Donnelly: And with Saturday...
[00:24:00] Gerard Donnelly: Just keep reminding her that the new position could be lower power.
[00:24:03] Gerard Donnelly: Yeah, she might be able to get outside, though, too.
[00:24:06] Abby Jorgensen: Now that her ankle's better, I was having her inside because I didn't want her going out and falling on her ankle.
[00:24:13] Abby Jorgensen: Hey, Abby.
[00:24:14] Gerard Donnelly: Hey.
[00:24:16] Abby Jorgensen: How are you?
[00:24:17] Abby Jorgensen: What's up, Jordan?
[00:24:18] Abby Jorgensen: How you doing?
[00:24:19] Abby Jorgensen: Good.
[00:24:19] Abby Jorgensen: How are you?
[00:24:20] Abby Jorgensen: Yeah, good.
[00:24:21] Gerard Donnelly: Good.
[00:24:22] Gerard Donnelly: How is it over there?
[00:24:23] Gerard Donnelly: Aussie?
[00:24:25] Abby Jorgensen: It's a little bit better.
[00:24:27] Abby Jorgensen: Yeah, it's 50 degrees.
[00:24:30] Gerard Donnelly: It's probably harder than here.
[00:24:32] Gerard Donnelly: Yeah.
[00:24:34] Abby Jorgensen: That's the problem with the trails yesterday was because we had all that snow, like the melting, and then it refreezes overnight.
[00:24:42] Abby Jorgensen: And so there's still patches of ice.
[00:24:45] Abby Jorgensen: Yeah.
[00:24:46] Abby Jorgensen: Like my front yard is still snowy, but my backyard is all clear because of the sun.
[00:24:53] Abby Jorgensen: Yeah.
[00:24:53] Abby Jorgensen: yeah.
[00:24:53] Abby Jorgensen: Yeah.
[00:24:55] Gerard Donnelly: All right.
[00:24:55] Gerard Donnelly: Were you all right with Michaela?
[00:24:57] Abby Jorgensen: Yeah.
[00:24:58] Abby Jorgensen: Yeah.
[00:24:58] Abby Jorgensen: Okay.
[00:25:00] Abby Jorgensen: Blair?
[00:25:01] Gerard Donnelly: He should be good.
[00:25:03] Abby Jorgensen: I just talked to him the other day, and then he goes on a ski trip.
[00:25:09] Abby Jorgensen: Yep.
[00:25:11] Abby Jorgensen: That's huge.
[00:25:12] Abby Jorgensen: Yeah.
[00:25:13] Abby Jorgensen: So, and he had a, like a, tweaked his knee, so we laid off the plane until the ski trip is over.
[00:25:21] Abby Jorgensen: Yep, okay.
[00:25:25] Gerard Donnelly: All right, well, when they're skiing every day, you know, if they ski six or seven hours a day, it is really hard to train.
[00:25:34] Abby Jorgensen: He said he didn't want to have to worry about it, too, where they're going, so.
[00:25:39] Abby Jorgensen: Yep.
[00:25:42] Abby Jorgensen: Yep.
[00:25:43] Gerard Donnelly: That's a tough one, isn't it?
[00:25:44] Gerard Donnelly: Yeah.
[00:25:47] Gerard Donnelly: Okay, Pemberton?
[00:25:51] Abby Jorgensen: He's good.
[00:25:51] Abby Jorgensen: She, last week, she, we fit her 5K in in the middle of the week because she was sick the last, the following week, and she.
[00:26:00] Abby Jorgensen: She did really well on her 5K.
[00:26:02] Abby Jorgensen: Was that her first 5K?
[00:26:04] Gerard Donnelly: Yeah.
[00:26:05] Gerard Donnelly: Yes.
[00:26:05] Gerard Donnelly: She's run 25 minutes.
[00:26:07] Abby Jorgensen: That's great.
[00:26:07] Abby Jorgensen: Yeah.
[00:26:08] Abby Jorgensen: She supersedes herself.
[00:26:10] Abby Jorgensen: Oh, God.
[00:26:11] Gerard Donnelly: She executed brilliantly.
[00:26:12] Gerard Donnelly: That's fantastic.
[00:26:15] Gerard Donnelly: 509 and 454.
[00:26:16] Gerard Donnelly: Well done.
[00:26:18] Gerard Donnelly: Really good.
[00:26:19] Gerard Donnelly: Yeah.
[00:26:20] Gerard Donnelly: Is she enjoying it?
[00:26:21] Abby Jorgensen: Yeah.
[00:26:22] Abby Jorgensen: She even, she told me today, she's like, put a session on Christmas because I think I'm going and I want to get away from the family and train.
[00:26:31] Abby Jorgensen: Yeah.
[00:26:32] Abby Jorgensen: Okay.
[00:26:33] Gerard Donnelly: Look, this is what I did with my athletes.
[00:26:37] Gerard Donnelly: I'll put, okay, Christmas, I've said, okay, here's your choices, three options.
[00:26:48] Gerard Donnelly: Day off, easy or normal with intensity.
[00:26:54] Gerard Donnelly: So, so then they've got the choice and I'll put, I'll put the session in, but it's up to them.
[00:26:59] Gerard Donnelly: And then.
[00:26:59] Gerard Donnelly: put, I'll I'll put,
[00:27:00] Gerard Donnelly: Coaches notes.
[00:27:01] Gerard Donnelly: I'm saying, you know, same thing.
[00:27:04] Gerard Donnelly: It's your option.
[00:27:06] Gerard Donnelly: So that way, you've got all bases covered.
[00:27:09] Gerard Donnelly: Yeah.
[00:27:10] Gerard Donnelly: I've talked to most of them and what their plans are.
[00:27:13] Abby Jorgensen: Yep.
[00:27:16] Gerard Donnelly: So.
[00:27:20] Gerard Donnelly: So, yeah, she seems to be going along nicely, doesn't she?
[00:27:23] Gerard Donnelly: Yeah.
[00:27:24] Abby Jorgensen: Yeah, she's not like too, I don't know what we thought she would.
[00:27:28] Abby Jorgensen: Yeah, she's not too needy.
[00:27:30] Abby Jorgensen: Yep.
[00:27:32] Gerard Donnelly: So her run sessions, is that kind of walk run?
[00:27:35] Gerard Donnelly: Is that she's coming back from injury?
[00:27:36] Abby Jorgensen: that's what she started with, with her walk runs.
[00:27:39] Abby Jorgensen: And then I think next week I told her I wanted to try some.
[00:27:43] Abby Jorgensen: I mean, I was like, if you can run a 5K without hopping.
[00:27:48] Abby Jorgensen: Yep.
[00:27:50] Gerard Donnelly: She's just always done run walks.
[00:27:52] Abby Jorgensen: So I think it was her knees that bothered her before.
[00:27:55] Abby Jorgensen: Yep.
[00:27:56] Gerard Donnelly: think, I think try to get her out of the walk runs and try to get her to do.
[00:27:59] Gerard Donnelly: Okay.
[00:27:59] Gerard Donnelly: Okay.
[00:27:59] Gerard Donnelly: Okay.
[00:27:59] Gerard Donnelly: Okay.
[00:28:00] Gerard Donnelly: So 30 minutes, five minute, five minute job and 30 minutes, then five minute job.
[00:28:06] Gerard Donnelly: Just easy, you know, just get it and say, we want to, we want to get you out of the walk run habit.
[00:28:10] Gerard Donnelly: We want to, we want to just get you.
[00:28:14] Gerard Donnelly: Yeah.
[00:28:15] Gerard Donnelly: I mean, that progression is fine for another, for another week.
[00:28:18] Abby Jorgensen: Yeah.
[00:28:18] Abby Jorgensen: figured after 16 minutes, you might as well.
[00:28:21] Abby Jorgensen: Yeah, that's good.
[00:28:22] Gerard Donnelly: You're already doing that.
[00:28:23] Gerard Donnelly: I don't know about, he'll repeat, Abby, if she's coming back from injury.
[00:28:27] Gerard Donnelly: Um, I think it's just about getting her to run again, consistently.
[00:28:33] Gerard Donnelly: Okay.
[00:28:35] Gerard Donnelly: Um, and if you can, try to, I don't know whether this is, she's able to fit this in, uh, but, you know, run there, run there, run there, run there.
[00:28:45] Gerard Donnelly: So get four runs in.
[00:28:47] Gerard Donnelly: Um, but you know better than I do whether she, that's too much for her.
[00:28:53] Gerard Donnelly: small amounts of running more often is better.
[00:28:57] Gerard Donnelly: Okay.
[00:28:58] Gerard Donnelly: So, so you don't have to make them.
[00:29:00] Gerard Donnelly: You know, you can make them 30 minutes, 30 minutes, 30 minutes, and 45.
[00:29:08] Gerard Donnelly: And, you know, down the track, we would want to see someone not be sore or injured after four or eight weeks of, you know, four runs a week.
[00:29:17] Gerard Donnelly: And then you would throw in the first of the hill repeats.
[00:29:21] Gerard Donnelly: So all the time, you're trying to minimise the risk.
[00:29:25] Gerard Donnelly: So the minute you start doing some intensity, then all sorts of problems occur.
[00:29:30] Gerard Donnelly: If they're not, if their body's not used to the running load, that's all.
[00:29:34] Gerard Donnelly: Okay.
[00:29:35] Gerard Donnelly: You okay with that?
[00:29:36] Gerard Donnelly: Yep.
[00:29:38] Gerard Donnelly: Glenn?
[00:29:40] Abby Jorgensen: He's getting back into it a little bit.
[00:29:44] Abby Jorgensen: Yep.
[00:29:48] Gerard Donnelly: Two or three weeks is absolutely fine for taking his time.
[00:29:51] Gerard Donnelly: Yeah, he has.
[00:29:52] Abby Jorgensen: He gave me a whole list of his goals for next year.
[00:29:55] Abby Jorgensen: Fantastic.
[00:29:56] Gerard Donnelly: Can you stick them into TrainingPeaks for me?
[00:29:59] Abby Jorgensen: Yeah.
[00:29:59] Abby Jorgensen: Yeah.
[00:30:00] Abby Jorgensen: Yes, I'm trying to think where.
[00:30:03] Gerard Donnelly: You don't have to do it now, but.
[00:30:04] Gerard Donnelly: Yeah, I'm just trying to find where he sent me all this stuff.
[00:30:08] Abby Jorgensen: Yeah, he has quite a few different things he wants to do, but.
[00:30:12] Abby Jorgensen: Yep.
[00:30:14] Abby Jorgensen: Yeah.
[00:30:16] Gerard Donnelly: Is he, is your head back in it?
[00:30:19] Abby Jorgensen: Yeah, it seems to be like everything he is.
[00:30:22] Abby Jorgensen: He, he is just like, it's hard for him to, you know, communicate what, like, his wife is feeling, which it's always an experience for, for her, it is for him.
[00:30:35] Abby Jorgensen: I'm like, you just gotta support her.
[00:30:37] Abby Jorgensen: Like, that's, you can't really.
[00:30:39] Abby Jorgensen: that's right.
[00:30:40] Abby Jorgensen: Yep.
[00:30:41] Gerard Donnelly: Yep.
[00:30:42] Gerard Donnelly: He can't stop his life, though.
[00:30:44] Gerard Donnelly: Yeah, that's what I was like.
[00:30:45] Abby Jorgensen: You just gotta be there for her.
[00:30:47] Abby Jorgensen: then, you know, obviously.
[00:30:50] Gerard Donnelly: Yep.
[00:30:51] Gerard Donnelly: All right.
[00:30:52] Gerard Donnelly: Uh, Mario?
[00:30:54] Gerard Donnelly: He's good.
[00:30:55] Abby Jorgensen: He did really well last week.
[00:30:56] Abby Jorgensen: He hit all of his workouts.
[00:30:59] Abby Jorgensen: All
[00:31:00] Abby Jorgensen: Oh, fantastic.
[00:31:02] Abby Jorgensen: We're still waiting on the power pedals got delayed.
[00:31:05] Abby Jorgensen: Oh, no.
[00:31:06] Abby Jorgensen: With shipping.
[00:31:07] Abby Jorgensen: I mean, like, with Christmas, I think.
[00:31:09] Abby Jorgensen: Yes, okay.
[00:31:10] Abby Jorgensen: So.
[00:31:11] Gerard Donnelly: His backside still sore or he got through that a bit?
[00:31:14] Gerard Donnelly: Yeah, he hasn't said anything to me.
[00:31:17] Abby Jorgensen: I just talked to him.
[00:31:19] Abby Jorgensen: Figured out the, he couldn't figure out his watch in the swimming, so I helped him with that.
[00:31:26] Abby Jorgensen: But, yeah, we're just using RPE, but then the power for the trainer, so.
[00:31:32] Abby Jorgensen: Yeah, that's great.
[00:31:36] Gerard Donnelly: If it doesn't look like his pedals are coming, you know, just use, he's got the kicker, hasn't he?
[00:31:41] Gerard Donnelly: Yeah.
[00:31:42] Gerard Donnelly: Just do an FTP test with the kicker power meter.
[00:31:45] Gerard Donnelly: If it, you know, if it's going to be delayed, because we can't just keep going RPE for weeks.
[00:31:52] Gerard Donnelly: You might as well do a test.
[00:31:57] Gerard Donnelly: Hopefully it comes, though, you can.
[00:31:59] Abby Jorgensen: Yeah, he said that.
[00:32:00] Abby Jorgensen: The bike shop told them it should be at some point this week.
[00:32:04] Abby Jorgensen: Great.
[00:32:04] Abby Jorgensen: Okay.
[00:32:05] Gerard Donnelly: And as soon as it comes, Abby, test him.
[00:32:10] Gerard Donnelly: Get rid of whatever bike session you've got, test him.
[00:32:17] Gerard Donnelly: That way, from that point on, you're really training accurately.
[00:32:22] Gerard Donnelly: Yeah.
[00:32:24] Gerard Donnelly: Okay.
[00:32:28] Gerard Donnelly: Anything else on him?
[00:32:29] Abby Jorgensen: Nope.
[00:32:30] Abby Jorgensen: He's just going camping those days that he's unavailable.
[00:32:33] Abby Jorgensen: Yeah.
[00:32:36] Gerard Donnelly: Running, is there an injury with his running or?
[00:32:41] Gerard Donnelly: No, he just basically started from not a whole lot of anything.
[00:32:46] Abby Jorgensen: Yeah.
[00:32:46] Abby Jorgensen: Same theory.
[00:32:47] Gerard Donnelly: Okay.
[00:32:48] Gerard Donnelly: Just try to get three minimum runs.
[00:32:54] Gerard Donnelly: Week one, he's only doing 11 kilometers.
[00:32:56] Gerard Donnelly: Sorry.
[00:32:58] Gerard Donnelly: Week one, he did 10.
[00:32:59] Gerard Donnelly: being in...
[00:32:59] Gerard Donnelly: Beingrest
[00:33:00] Gerard Donnelly: Week two, he's done 11.
[00:33:03] Gerard Donnelly: Week three, he's done 11.
[00:33:05] Gerard Donnelly: So everything I've said about the previous athletes is the same.
[00:33:10] Gerard Donnelly: Just try to get them to do at least three runs where we're just progressing the duration from 11 to 15 to 20 to 25.
[00:33:24] Gerard Donnelly: Okay.
[00:33:26] Gerard Donnelly: So this week, like you've got two runs, somehow get another run in, maybe on, add a run in on Friday.
[00:33:36] Gerard Donnelly: Are your pools open on Boxing Day?
[00:33:39] Gerard Donnelly: Yeah, we don't celebrate Boxing Day.
[00:33:42] Abby Jorgensen: Okay.
[00:33:42] Gerard Donnelly: It's a public holiday for us.
[00:33:45] Gerard Donnelly: Oh, yeah.
[00:33:45] Abby Jorgensen: mean, some pools are closed from Christmas to whatever.
[00:33:50] Abby Jorgensen: just depends on.
[00:33:51] Abby Jorgensen: Yeah.
[00:33:52] Abby Jorgensen: Yeah.
[00:33:52] Abby Jorgensen: course.
[00:33:53] Abby Jorgensen: Yeah.
[00:33:54] Gerard Donnelly: Look, I'm, you're so used to running long duration.
[00:34:00] Gerard Donnelly: Just be super careful with guys who are only doing 10 or 11K each week that, you know, one of the runs isn't the 11K.
[00:34:07] Gerard Donnelly: You know, do 20 or 30 or 40 minutes four times.
[00:34:12] Gerard Donnelly: Okay.
[00:34:12] Gerard Donnelly: You know, that way the risk is so much less.
[00:34:15] Gerard Donnelly: For them to go for a 50-minute run, you know, he's just not used to that.
[00:34:23] Gerard Donnelly: So, yeah, so kind of just really, like a lot of his history is there's hardly any running at all.
[00:34:32] Gerard Donnelly: Like 3K, he's walking a bit.
[00:34:36] Gerard Donnelly: So with athletes who, you know, like Peter, you just won't have the same conversation.
[00:34:42] Gerard Donnelly: But athletes like Mario, who's new to it, you know, they just need more consistent running with less duration and no intensity.
[00:34:56] Gerard Donnelly: Okay?
[00:34:57] Gerard Donnelly: Yep.
[00:34:57] Gerard Donnelly: So you go back and...
[00:35:00] Gerard Donnelly: Have a flick through who you think is a decent runner who's nailing it.
[00:35:05] Gerard Donnelly: know, the best runners need four runs a week.
[00:35:07] Gerard Donnelly: The beginner runners need three, but four if they can, but shorter duration.
[00:35:13] Gerard Donnelly: Don't let them run twice a week.
[00:35:15] Gerard Donnelly: It's too, unless they're coming back from injury.
[00:35:19] Gerard Donnelly: Okay?
[00:35:20] Gerard Donnelly: Okay.
[00:35:21] Gerard Donnelly: Mark?
[00:35:25] Abby Jorgensen: For the most part, I mean, he has a little bit of patellar tendonitis going on.
[00:35:35] Abby Jorgensen: Yeah.
[00:35:36] Abby Jorgensen: But he says it doesn't, like, it just depends on, like, it's less painful when he's on the treadmill.
[00:35:45] Abby Jorgensen: And then, I mean, his work schedule, too, was crazy last week.
[00:35:49] Abby Jorgensen: Is he seeing anybody about his patella?
[00:35:51] Abby Jorgensen: Yeah, he said he saw somebody, or he was supposed to see somebody last Thursday.
[00:35:55] Abby Jorgensen: I believe that that was the day.
[00:35:57] Abby Jorgensen: He was there for me.
[00:35:58] Gerard Donnelly: Yep.
[00:36:01] Gerard Donnelly: He's doing okay with his bike session?
[00:36:05] Abby Jorgensen: bike sessions are good.
[00:36:12] Gerard Donnelly: Great.
[00:36:13] Gerard Donnelly: Just keep reminding them to get their cadence up to 90 for those one-minute efforts.
[00:36:25] Gerard Donnelly: If especially if he's landing 230s when the range is – bottom of the range is 220, go to the bottom of the range, get your cadence up, get your heart rate up.
[00:36:34] Gerard Donnelly: Well, we can't even see his heart rate, but – He forgot to drop that day.
[00:36:38] Abby Jorgensen: Yeah.
[00:36:38] Abby Jorgensen: Yeah.
[00:36:42] Gerard Donnelly: What's happening at the end of the week?
[00:36:43] Gerard Donnelly: Is it – He's going out now.
[00:36:45] Abby Jorgensen: Yeah.
[00:36:46] Abby Jorgensen: Yeah.
[00:36:47] Gerard Donnelly: So he can't run?
[00:36:49] Abby Jorgensen: I told him if he can run, do, but he said it's going to be depending on – I don't know where they're going, but it sounded like I wasn't going to have a lot of stuff, but
[00:37:00] Gerard Donnelly: Yeah, just try and ask a few more questions, like where are you going?
[00:37:06] Gerard Donnelly: There's no way that anybody who lives on the planet Earth can't run, you know, unless they're in the middle of the ski fields, and even then you can run on a treadmill.
[00:37:19] Gerard Donnelly: So, yeah, suss out that, you know, and put something in, just put the word optional, you know, encourage you to go for a run because you don't want to have...
[00:37:31] Gerard Donnelly: Hey, Gibson, you don't want to have all these periods where they think it's okay just to not do anything, unless it's impossible, okay?
[00:37:42] Gerard Donnelly: So dig a bit deeper.
[00:37:44] Abby Jorgensen: Okay.
[00:37:47] Gerard Donnelly: Okay.
[00:37:52] Gerard Donnelly: Philippe, the most compliant athlete.
[00:37:55] Abby Jorgensen: Yep, he's good.
[00:38:00] Abby Jorgensen: A lot of skiing.
[00:38:01] Abby Jorgensen: Yeah, that's good.
[00:38:03] Gerard Donnelly: So he's doing his last weekend.
[00:38:06] Gerard Donnelly: Is he away?
[00:38:08] Gerard Donnelly: It's like every weekend they go.
[00:38:10] Abby Jorgensen: Yeah, okay.
[00:38:11] Gerard Donnelly: Where do they go?
[00:38:13] Abby Jorgensen: I don't know.
[00:38:14] Abby Jorgensen: Somewhere in Canada.
[00:38:16] Abby Jorgensen: Yeah, okay.
[00:38:19] Gerard Donnelly: He must be due for testing soon, is he?
[00:38:21] Gerard Donnelly: Yeah, next week.
[00:38:23] Gerard Donnelly: Okay, great.
[00:38:26] Gerard Donnelly: Good.
[00:38:30] Gerard Donnelly: Okay, yeah.
[00:38:30] Gerard Donnelly: You happy with him?
[00:38:31] Gerard Donnelly: Yeah, he, no complaints.
[00:38:33] Abby Jorgensen: He does everything.
[00:38:35] Abby Jorgensen: Yep.
[00:38:38] Gerard Donnelly: Erin's in Australia, is she?
[00:38:39] Gerard Donnelly: She is.
[00:38:42] Gerard Donnelly: We're doing good.
[00:38:44] Abby Jorgensen: Yep.
[00:38:46] Abby Jorgensen: Yeah, so she should be, I think I saw something on Instagram.
[00:38:50] Abby Jorgensen: She's there.
[00:38:52] Abby Jorgensen: Yep, okay.
[00:38:53] Abby Jorgensen: So.
[00:38:54] Gerard Donnelly: Great.
[00:38:56] Gerard Donnelly: And is she staying with family or is she staying in a hotel?
[00:39:00] Gerard Donnelly: I believe she's staying with family because I think her parents live there still.
[00:39:04] Abby Jorgensen: Yeah.
[00:39:04] Abby Jorgensen: And so she can get to a gym?
[00:39:07] Abby Jorgensen: Yeah, I told her.
[00:39:08] Abby Jorgensen: She's like, I don't know which one yet, but I'll find one.
[00:39:12] Abby Jorgensen: Yeah, great.
[00:39:13] Abby Jorgensen: Yeah.
[00:39:13] Abby Jorgensen: Very good.
[00:39:15] Gerard Donnelly: Yeah.
[00:39:16] Gerard Donnelly: Same thing.
[00:39:17] Gerard Donnelly: You know, you can run anywhere.
[00:39:19] Gerard Donnelly: So, really, you know, push to have, you know, Tuesday, Thursday, Saturday bike, and, you know, even if have to have Monday, Wednesday, Friday, Sunday run, you know, just fill her up with sessions.
[00:39:41] Gerard Donnelly: How's Riley going?
[00:39:43] Gerard Donnelly: He's good.
[00:39:43] Abby Jorgensen: He had another 10 watt increase, like a three minute 10 KPR.
[00:39:49] Abby Jorgensen: And maybe like a 30 second swim PR, if I remember, or 20 seconds, 30 or 20.
[00:39:58] Gerard Donnelly: So, so.
[00:40:00] Gerard Donnelly: For reason, his data's not in spreadsheet yet.
[00:40:05] Gerard Donnelly: Can you just prompt Marv, please?
[00:40:16] Gerard Donnelly: He's a bit of a goer, isn't he?
[00:40:20] Gerard Donnelly: So he started at 170, and now he's at 240.
[00:40:27] Gerard Donnelly: Jesus.
[00:40:31] Gerard Donnelly: Jesus, look at his execution.
[00:40:33] Gerard Donnelly: Yeah.
[00:40:35] Abby Jorgensen: It's finally getting to the point of...
[00:40:40] Abby Jorgensen: Yeah, like I told him, I was like, now we're finally getting to that point where he would have like 30 or 40 watts between the stars.
[00:40:48] Abby Jorgensen: Yep.
[00:40:50] Gerard Donnelly: So he's got 242.
[00:40:51] Gerard Donnelly: That's another 10.
[00:40:52] Gerard Donnelly: So it's really fantastic.
[00:40:58] Gerard Donnelly: Here's a good case study.
[00:41:00] Gerard Donnelly: Yeah, he's a hard worker.
[00:41:03] Abby Jorgensen: His 10K run, he says that's the fastest he's run since 2018.
[00:41:14] Gerard Donnelly: I hope he's happy.
[00:41:16] Abby Jorgensen: Oh, yeah, he is.
[00:41:18] Gerard Donnelly: Yeah, so what's he run?
[00:41:21] Gerard Donnelly: He's run 101.
[00:41:23] Gerard Donnelly: What did he do?
[00:41:24] Gerard Donnelly: He did 104, so he said three minutes, wasn't it?
[00:41:26] Abby Jorgensen: Yeah.
[00:41:28] Gerard Donnelly: Three-minute PB, so he's run 106, 104, now he's at 101.
[00:41:32] Gerard Donnelly: So that's five minutes since September, a five-minute improvement.
[00:41:40] Gerard Donnelly: Wow.
[00:41:40] Abby Jorgensen: Yeah, and he was one that when he started, he said that he hadn't improved his run in years, like whatever, like coach or whatever he was working with before, like they never.
[00:41:58] Gerard Donnelly: That's really key information, Abby.
[00:41:59] Gerard Donnelly: Abby.
[00:42:00] Gerard Donnelly: Do you know his 5k at the back end of that 10k was a 5k PB.
[00:42:10] Gerard Donnelly: He's run 29.46 and he ran 32 minutes in August.
[00:42:14] Gerard Donnelly: Yeah, he's a fresh 5k.
[00:42:18] Gerard Donnelly: You know, he's done that 5k in the back of a 10k.
[00:42:25] Gerard Donnelly: We need to do a case study in England.
[00:42:28] Gerard Donnelly: Who was it?
[00:42:28] Gerard Donnelly: Riley.
[00:42:32] Gerard Donnelly: Riley McLean.
[00:42:36] Gerard Donnelly: How's your swimming going?
[00:42:38] Gerard Donnelly: It's so good.
[00:42:39] Abby Jorgensen: Yeah, it's come down.
[00:42:40] Abby Jorgensen: He's about that 150 pace, I think.
[00:42:44] Abby Jorgensen: Riley Yeah, don't know why.
[00:42:46] Gerard Donnelly: It's 205, but that's against 900, so 150 is more accurate.
[00:42:53] Gerard Donnelly: Riley McLean.
[00:42:54] Gerard Donnelly: It's, yeah, yards versus metres.
[00:42:57] Abby Jorgensen: It's about a 10-second difference, right?
[00:42:59] Abby Jorgensen: Riley
[00:43:00] Abby Jorgensen: Yeah, that's not that.
[00:43:03] Gerard Donnelly: That's, that's, that's reading.
[00:43:07] Abby Jorgensen: Versus.
[00:43:08] Abby Jorgensen: That's right.
[00:43:09] Abby Jorgensen: Yep.
[00:43:10] Gerard Donnelly: Fantastic.
[00:43:11] Gerard Donnelly: Uh, so he's got a 10k run next week.
[00:43:17] Gerard Donnelly: Yeah, he's going up to St.
[00:43:19] Abby Jorgensen: Louis for family and he signed up for a trail run up there.
[00:43:23] Abby Jorgensen: Good.
[00:43:23] Abby Jorgensen: Yep.
[00:43:24] Abby Jorgensen: Oh, yeah.
[00:43:25] Abby Jorgensen: He said there was a couple big climbs in it, so.
[00:43:28] Gerard Donnelly: Yep.
[00:43:29] Abby Jorgensen: And then he's doing a mountain bike.
[00:43:33] Abby Jorgensen: Good.
[00:43:39] Gerard Donnelly: Gravel races, are they?
[00:43:41] Gerard Donnelly: Yeah, mountain bike, I think.
[00:43:43] Abby Jorgensen: I don't, I don't know what the difference is.
[00:43:46] Abby Jorgensen: I mean, mountains, but there's not many mountains in Texas, so I don't No.
[00:43:51] Gerard Donnelly: So he's got a half marathon.
[00:43:53] Gerard Donnelly: That's his next thing.
[00:43:54] Gerard Donnelly: Yeah, that's his, like, checkpoint for us before.
[00:43:58] Abby Jorgensen: Is he doing, is he doing.
[00:44:00] Gerard Donnelly: The full Ironman?
[00:44:01] Gerard Donnelly: Yeah.
[00:44:02] Gerard Donnelly: Oh, my God.
[00:44:07] Gerard Donnelly: That's only 16 weeks away.
[00:44:13] Gerard Donnelly: How are we going with this?
[00:44:25] Gerard Donnelly: Okay, I think we might have to start to increase his endurance ride quite substantially.
[00:44:34] Gerard Donnelly: He's really only got 15 long rides left.
[00:44:40] Gerard Donnelly: Um, so, does he live where, can he ride outside where he is?
[00:44:48] Gerard Donnelly: Where does he live?
[00:44:49] Abby Jorgensen: I would think so, Texas.
[00:44:51] Abby Jorgensen: Yeah, okay.
[00:44:52] Abby Jorgensen: I mean, they do get some weird weather this time of year too, but.
[00:44:56] Abby Jorgensen: Yep.
[00:44:57] Abby Jorgensen: His last few ones, he's wanted it.
[00:45:00] Abby Jorgensen: The indoor one.
[00:45:01] Abby Jorgensen: Yep.
[00:45:03] Gerard Donnelly: Well, you need to get him to add some more time to this.
[00:45:07] Gerard Donnelly: Has he got Ruby or anything?
[00:45:09] Gerard Donnelly: What's he do?
[00:45:10] Gerard Donnelly: He has Swift.
[00:45:11] Abby Jorgensen: He has Swift, right, okay.
[00:45:14] Gerard Donnelly: So we, you know.
[00:45:16] Gerard Donnelly: He's this week.
[00:45:19] Abby Jorgensen: He's up in St.
[00:45:21] Abby Jorgensen: Louis this week, which would be colder.
[00:45:23] Abby Jorgensen: Yep.
[00:45:24] Gerard Donnelly: But is he training indoor at St.
[00:45:27] Gerard Donnelly: Louis?
[00:45:27] Gerard Donnelly: Yeah, he brought his trainer up.
[00:45:29] Abby Jorgensen: he brought his trainer.
[00:45:30] Abby Jorgensen: Yeah, okay.
[00:45:31] Gerard Donnelly: Look, I would add more time to this warm-up and cool-down.
[00:45:37] Gerard Donnelly: Maybe grab a longer one.
[00:45:43] Gerard Donnelly: Yeah, we don't want be caught short with his duration.
[00:45:52] Gerard Donnelly: Maybe.
[00:45:54] Gerard Donnelly: Maybe that one's better.
[00:45:56] Gerard Donnelly: Okay.
[00:45:59] Gerard Donnelly: Maybe.
[00:45:59] Gerard Donnelly: Maybe.
[00:45:59] Gerard Donnelly: Maybe.
[00:46:01] Gerard Donnelly: And kind of events like this, they're great, but it's too short.
[00:46:13] Gerard Donnelly: If the Ironman's his goal, you know, it's great to do these events, but I would be saying, if you go and do that event, warm up longer, and then after the event, go for another two hours.
[00:46:30] Gerard Donnelly: And that's okay.
[00:46:31] Gerard Donnelly: I'm happy for him to do the event, but tell him why, you know, we've got basically 15 long rides left to prepare you for a six-hour ride.
[00:46:43] Gerard Donnelly: You know, so, so potentially we need to be doing here, needs to be four hours.
[00:46:50] Gerard Donnelly: This one needs to be, you know, two and a half hours indoors, like three and a half outdoor, as you know.
[00:46:58] Gerard Donnelly: That's So, that, Nate said.
[00:47:01] Gerard Donnelly: And then, you know, this needs to be four and a half, five.
[00:47:04] Gerard Donnelly: And so by time we get down to race day, he's already done, you know, eight to 10 weeks of more than four hour Saturdays.
[00:47:15] Gerard Donnelly: And because he's a really slow runner, he's a one hour 10k runner, which, you know, is going to mean he's going to be four and a half to five hour runner on race day.
[00:47:32] Gerard Donnelly: So, we need to get his run, he's at 33k at the moment, 29, 12, 17, 17.
[00:47:45] Gerard Donnelly: So, we need to have some weeks where he's going, you know, 40, 50, 60 kilometres.
[00:47:51] Gerard Donnelly: You know exactly what you had to do, 70, 80.
[00:47:54] Gerard Donnelly: So, so there's going to be a point where...
[00:48:00] Gerard Donnelly: So where if we're starting to increase the duration on the weekend, we then have to start cutting back the intensity on the Tuesday.
[00:48:13] Gerard Donnelly: But at the moment, it's fine.
[00:48:15] Gerard Donnelly: But even that run this week, I'll be saying to him, you know, warm up longer.
[00:48:21] Gerard Donnelly: Do 10, 15 minute, 20 minute warm up.
[00:48:24] Gerard Donnelly: Do the run and then go for another run, easy run afterwards.
[00:48:30] Gerard Donnelly: So you're getting an hour and a half in.
[00:48:32] Gerard Donnelly: Well, his 10K is going to be frigging an hour anyway, isn't it?
[00:48:35] Gerard Donnelly: Yeah.
[00:48:36] Gerard Donnelly: So, you we've just got to keep, you know, keep inching.
[00:48:40] Gerard Donnelly: Like you run an hour 25, that's great.
[00:48:43] Gerard Donnelly: So, you know, we've just got to keep five minutes onto it, an hour 30.
[00:48:47] Gerard Donnelly: He's already done an hour 30.
[00:48:51] Gerard Donnelly: That's great.
[00:48:52] Gerard Donnelly: You know, just keep adding more time, right?
[00:48:56] Gerard Donnelly: We can't just go from 90 minutes to two hours.
[00:49:00] Gerard Donnelly: We've got to go, you know, 40 hours, 52 hours, etc.
[00:49:09] Gerard Donnelly: So we need to add another run if we can too, Abby, for that week.
[00:49:13] Gerard Donnelly: You do a run off the bike here.
[00:49:16] Gerard Donnelly: So it's a four-hour run with a 15-minute run off the bike.
[00:49:22] Gerard Donnelly: And just slowly adding a bit more time to this, 50 minutes, 60 minutes here.
[00:49:30] Abby Jorgensen: Okay?
[00:49:31] Abby Jorgensen: Okay.
[00:49:34] Gerard Donnelly: Make it so it's not too big a jump, but we've got to think ahead here, 16 weeks and working backwards.
[00:49:41] Gerard Donnelly: You don't want get to eight weeks out and go, jeez, we haven't run past, you know, two hours, we haven't ridden past four.
[00:49:49] Gerard Donnelly: But tell him why, you know, we've got to progress now.
[00:49:56] Gerard Donnelly: Okay, any questions, Ellen?
[00:49:58] Gerard Donnelly: Nope, that makes sense.
[00:50:01] Gerard Donnelly: How's Peter going?
[00:50:03] Gerard Donnelly: No, he's all over the place because he's traveling again.
[00:50:07] Abby Jorgensen: Yep.
[00:50:08] Gerard Donnelly: What's next for him?
[00:50:10] Gerard Donnelly: it not for a while?
[00:50:11] Gerard Donnelly: Yeah.
[00:50:14] Abby Jorgensen: Yeah, I don't think he's put anything on the calendar race-wise.
[00:50:18] Abby Jorgensen: Yep.
[00:50:19] Gerard Donnelly: And they're good conversations to have with everybody around this Christmas period.
[00:50:22] Gerard Donnelly: Hey, come on, let's start planning.
[00:50:25] Gerard Donnelly: And if you stick them in, you know, stick them in here, click on goals and start putting them in, you know, whatever the goal is, you know, make sure that we're, that we've had a discussion about it.
[00:50:40] Gerard Donnelly: And like I say to you, put down as many events as you can find and then we'll talk about it.
[00:50:45] Gerard Donnelly: It doesn't mean we're going to do every one of them.
[00:50:49] Gerard Donnelly: So, so yeah, get them.
[00:50:50] Gerard Donnelly: And we just don't want a guy like him, they, they need, they need to work towards something.
[00:50:57] Gerard Donnelly: And if they haven't thought about that, they just.
[00:51:00] Gerard Donnelly: They're going to do this where it doesn't matter about training that much because I don't have a goal.
[00:51:04] Gerard Donnelly: So they end up training really poorly over this period.
[00:51:12] Gerard Donnelly: Yeah.
[00:51:13] Gerard Donnelly: Okay?
[00:51:14] Gerard Donnelly: Yep.
[00:51:16] Abby Jorgensen: Right.
[00:51:16] Gerard Donnelly: So get a conversation going with everybody if you have to, even if you send out a, you know, a mass text to everybody or an email or something.
[00:51:30] Gerard Donnelly: And just say, look, you know, what are we, what are we working towards?
[00:51:32] Gerard Donnelly: And the people who already are planned, don't worry about them.
[00:51:35] Gerard Donnelly: It's the ones that are, the ones that are already, you know, you want everybody thinking the same way.
[00:51:40] Gerard Donnelly: Let's, let's, let's think about next year.
[00:51:43] Gerard Donnelly: What are we, what are we working so hard for?
[00:51:49] Gerard Donnelly: Any questions on that?
[00:51:50] Gerard Donnelly: Nope.
[00:51:51] Abby Jorgensen: Dan?
[00:51:53] Abby Jorgensen: He's doing good.
[00:51:58] Gerard Donnelly: He's very compliant.
[00:52:01] Gerard Donnelly: So is he testing this week, is he?
[00:52:03] Abby Jorgensen: Yeah, we're going to try to.
[00:52:10] Abby Jorgensen: He's dealt with a little, like, adductor issue when he runs, so I cut back some of the intensity in his runs a little bit.
[00:52:20] Abby Jorgensen: Yeah.
[00:52:22] Abby Jorgensen: Is it resolved?
[00:52:23] Abby Jorgensen: Yeah, he says it's getting better, so he wanted to take this week, too, to lay off some intensity, so I didn't feel like we needed to.
[00:52:30] Abby Jorgensen: Test him in the run, because we kind of know where he's at, so.
[00:52:36] Gerard Donnelly: Yeah, okay, but when he's back running, don't be afraid to put a 5K in the middle of a block, or a 10K.
[00:52:42] Gerard Donnelly: Depends what his goal is.
[00:52:44] Gerard Donnelly: Yeah.
[00:52:46] Gerard Donnelly: What's he training for, Abby?
[00:52:47] Gerard Donnelly: Anything in particular?
[00:52:48] Abby Jorgensen: What is it?
[00:52:51] Gerard Donnelly: Ironman, Texas, 70.3.
[00:52:52] Gerard Donnelly: Great.
[00:52:53] Gerard Donnelly: Okay.
[00:52:57] Gerard Donnelly: What was, uh...
[00:52:59] Gerard Donnelly: uh...
[00:52:59] Gerard Donnelly: uh...
[00:53:01] Gerard Donnelly: Riley's race?
[00:53:03] Abby Jorgensen: It's Ironman, Texas, but that one's two different places, too.
[00:53:10] Abby Jorgensen: That one's, I can't remember where that one is, and then the other one's in the Woodlands.
[00:53:15] Abby Jorgensen: Yeah, okay.
[00:53:16] Abby Jorgensen: Yeah, that one's in March, and then Riley's is in April.
[00:53:20] Abby Jorgensen: Yeah.
[00:53:22] Gerard Donnelly: I believe, yeah.
[00:53:23] Abby Jorgensen: Good.
[00:53:24] Gerard Donnelly: Okay.
[00:53:27] Gerard Donnelly: All right, well, you just keep making sure that, you know, you don't, the race-ready stuff has to start eight weeks out, six to eight weeks out.
[00:53:35] Gerard Donnelly: They're ready, they're ready with some good endurance stuff.
[00:53:40] Gerard Donnelly: Where does Dan live?
[00:53:42] Gerard Donnelly: Texas.
[00:53:43] Abby Jorgensen: He lives in Texas, okay.
[00:53:45] Gerard Donnelly: So there's no reason why they can't be training normally.
[00:53:48] Abby Jorgensen: Yeah, he's usually, usually outside.
[00:53:51] Abby Jorgensen: There's been a couple of times he hasn't, but.
[00:53:53] Abby Jorgensen: Yeah.
[00:53:54] Abby Jorgensen: But, yeah.
[00:53:58] Abby Jorgensen: Good.
[00:53:59] Gerard Donnelly: Okay.
[00:54:00] Abby Jorgensen: But yeah, he just hit a 70.3 not too long ago, so he's on a good base going.
[00:54:08] Gerard Donnelly: Yeah, he did.
[00:54:13] Gerard Donnelly: When did he do that?
[00:54:20] Gerard Donnelly: There it is.
[00:54:23] Gerard Donnelly: Can you just make a note?
[00:54:25] Gerard Donnelly: Is it not in there?
[00:54:26] Abby Jorgensen: Oh, it is oil man, yeah.
[00:54:28] Abby Jorgensen: He got forced, didn't he?
[00:54:29] Abby Jorgensen: Yeah.
[00:54:30] Abby Jorgensen: Yeah, it is in there, sorry.
[00:54:32] Gerard Donnelly: Yeah.
[00:54:33] Gerard Donnelly: Good.
[00:54:36] Gerard Donnelly: Yep, okay.
[00:54:37] Gerard Donnelly: Sounds like you got...
[00:54:41] Gerard Donnelly: All the time, I'm just really...
[00:54:45] Gerard Donnelly: I don't want them running any intervals, any hills, any tempo, any...
[00:54:50] Gerard Donnelly: If they've got injuries, just get them running again four times a week.
[00:54:55] Gerard Donnelly: But explain why, you know?
[00:54:57] Gerard Donnelly: We're going to get our intensity from the bike, like in...
[00:54:59] Gerard Donnelly: And all...
[00:55:00] Gerard Donnelly: All of the data that we have from anybody who's just done four runs per week, they improve their 5K and 10K times, no problem.
[00:55:08] Gerard Donnelly: So, you know, encourage them, it's okay to do this, and we're protecting your injury.
[00:55:14] Gerard Donnelly: But to run less, if the injury isn't stopping you from running less, is not a good idea.
[00:55:22] Gerard Donnelly: Just run less intensity.
[00:55:24] Abby Jorgensen: Okay.
[00:55:26] Abby Jorgensen: Okay.
[00:55:27] Gerard Donnelly: Jen, the least compliant?
[00:55:29] Gerard Donnelly: Yeah, pretty.
[00:55:31] Abby Jorgensen: Pretty non-compliant.
[00:55:33] Abby Jorgensen: She didn't do a one-around.
[00:55:36] Gerard Donnelly: You're going to have to ask why she's getting coached.
[00:55:41] Gerard Donnelly: That's just hopeless.
[00:55:44] Gerard Donnelly: Yeah.
[00:55:44] Abby Jorgensen: Isn't it?
[00:55:45] Abby Jorgensen: Oh, God.
[00:55:48] Gerard Donnelly: What did she say when...
[00:55:51] Abby Jorgensen: I mean, she just got back to Vancouver, but while she was in London, she was just like, I just went and did whatever my friends did.
[00:55:59] Abby Jorgensen: was in London.
[00:55:59] Abby Jorgensen: Yeah.
[00:56:00] Abby Jorgensen: Didn't have my watch.
[00:56:06] Abby Jorgensen: But I asked her, was like, what do you, because her mom just got back home for a while.
[00:56:11] Abby Jorgensen: I think her mom's leaving again.
[00:56:12] Abby Jorgensen: Yeah.
[00:56:13] Abby Jorgensen: But I didn't know how, I was like, well, you can get on the bike and just ride.
[00:56:19] Abby Jorgensen: I mean, you can't use your mom's computer because then it would download to her mom's stuff.
[00:56:26] Abby Jorgensen: But she's got a running watch, hasn't she?
[00:56:28] Abby Jorgensen: Yeah.
[00:56:28] Gerard Donnelly: And that sure connects.
[00:56:33] Gerard Donnelly: She's not trying, is she?
[00:56:34] Gerard Donnelly: She's just not trying.
[00:56:38] Gerard Donnelly: Yeah, she, I think, yeah.
[00:56:42] Gerard Donnelly: I would be putting stuff in and saying, hey, you know, what's her race?
[00:56:47] Gerard Donnelly: She got a race?
[00:56:48] Gerard Donnelly: It's that Sun, Sunny Coast one.
[00:56:51] Abby Jorgensen: I don't know when that is.
[00:56:53] Abby Jorgensen: It's September.
[00:56:54] Abby Jorgensen: It's September.
[00:56:55] Abby Jorgensen: It's away.
[00:56:57] Gerard Donnelly: It's miles away.
[00:56:58] Gerard Donnelly: Yeah.
[00:56:58] Abby Jorgensen: Yeah.
[00:56:59] Abby Jorgensen: Yeah.
[00:56:59] Abby Jorgensen: Yeah.
[00:57:02] Abby Jorgensen: Just one moment.
[00:57:27] Gerard Donnelly: Yeah, she's got plenty of time, but she's just got the wrong habits.
[00:57:32] Gerard Donnelly: She doesn't have any training habits.
[00:57:36] Gerard Donnelly: I think this is a challenge for you, Abby.
[00:57:38] Gerard Donnelly: This has got to be, you're going to have to start to get her, work your magic here and get her to think differently.
[00:57:53] Gerard Donnelly: To get some fitness and she's just, yeah, I almost hate to say
[00:58:00] Gerard Donnelly: We'd rather coach someone who wants to train than someone like this.
[00:58:06] Gerard Donnelly: It's super frustrating for you, especially when her mom's so opposite.
[00:58:12] Abby Jorgensen: Yeah, mean, her mom's ran into an obstacle this last week with her mom and dad, but she messaged me and she's like, I've been trying, but when her mom broke her hip and something else.
[00:58:30] Abby Jorgensen: Yeah, I'm like, yeah, it's hard.
[00:58:33] Gerard Donnelly: Yeah, but I would be saying to her, you've got your mom's bike there, just get on and ride to RPE.
[00:58:39] Gerard Donnelly: Give her hotel gym bike sessions on it, you know, and, you know, you need to start getting into the training habit, unless you don't want to, Jen.
[00:58:50] Gerard Donnelly: And if you don't want to, then, you know, this isn't for you.
[00:59:00] Gerard Donnelly: More stuff, Abby, give her, you know, a 30-minute ride, you know, five-minute warm-up and a couple of sets, you know, two sets of five by 30 and short warm-down.
[00:59:09] Gerard Donnelly: Just make it achievable and vary the runs, you know.
[00:59:13] Gerard Donnelly: I just don't – I wouldn't be giving her 45-minute runs.
[00:59:16] Gerard Donnelly: She's run once.
[00:59:23] Gerard Donnelly: In three weeks, she's run twice.
[00:59:31] Gerard Donnelly: Yeah, change your mindset.
[00:59:34] Gerard Donnelly: Okay, 20-30-minute runs, 20-30-minute rides, okay?
[00:59:38] Gerard Donnelly: Change the whole thing.
[00:59:39] Gerard Donnelly: Okay.
[00:59:40] Abby Jorgensen: And get her moving.
[00:59:44] Gerard Donnelly: And there'll be a point where, you know, if it's not what you want, Jen, then we'll give you a spot to someone else.
[00:59:53] Gerard Donnelly: But that's a last resort.
[00:59:55] Gerard Donnelly: Yeah.
[00:59:57] Gerard Donnelly: All right, can you redo that week?
[01:00:00] Gerard Donnelly: And give us something to aspire to.
[01:00:03] Gerard Donnelly: You understand?
[01:00:04] Gerard Donnelly: Yeah, no, that makes sense.
[01:00:07] Abby Jorgensen: Okay, Bill.
[01:00:09] Gerard Donnelly: He's good.
[01:00:16] Gerard Donnelly: He seems to be going well, doesn't he?
[01:00:18] Gerard Donnelly: Yeah.
[01:00:19] Abby Jorgensen: I know the last few weeks he's just kind of wanted one session a day to get through the holidays.
[01:00:24] Abby Jorgensen: But other than that, yeah, he had that one bad session.
[01:00:28] Abby Jorgensen: But other than that, this one was really good.
[01:00:37] Gerard Donnelly: He's nailing it.
[01:00:39] Gerard Donnelly: Yeah.
[01:00:41] Abby Jorgensen: And those aren't his favorite either.
[01:00:44] Abby Jorgensen: No.
[01:00:45] Abby Jorgensen: He's oh.
[01:00:49] Gerard Donnelly: And he's testing, is he?
[01:00:52] Abby Jorgensen: Yep.
[01:00:57] Gerard Donnelly: Okay, so he's testing.
[01:00:59] Gerard Donnelly: He's not really moving.
[01:01:00] Gerard Donnelly: He's is he?
[01:01:01] Abby Jorgensen: Mm-mm.
[01:01:02] Gerard Donnelly: He's hovering around the same.
[01:01:06] Abby Jorgensen: He does always have a lot of testing.
[01:01:09] Abby Jorgensen: Like, he goes back and forth with, like, testing anxiety and stuff.
[01:01:15] Abby Jorgensen: Like, he just puts too much pressure on himself.
[01:01:18] Abby Jorgensen: And I've had those conversations that it doesn't – Yeah.
[01:01:21] Abby Jorgensen: I'm just doing this so we have numbers to train to, but he – Yeah.
[01:01:27] Abby Jorgensen: Has he been injured running?
[01:01:29] Gerard Donnelly: Yeah, was injured before the Ironman.
[01:01:31] Abby Jorgensen: Yeah.
[01:01:32] Abby Jorgensen: And then this week it was just because he can only get in one session.
[01:01:39] Abby Jorgensen: Yeah, that's good.
[01:01:42] Abby Jorgensen: Yeah.
[01:01:43] Gerard Donnelly: I would – if he's only doing one session a day, there's no way I'd give him two swims, Abby.
[01:01:48] Gerard Donnelly: Okay.
[01:01:49] Gerard Donnelly: Take care.
[01:01:50] Abby Jorgensen: One swim, three runs, three rides.
[01:01:55] Gerard Donnelly: Yeah.
[01:01:57] Gerard Donnelly: Yeah.
[01:01:59] Gerard Donnelly: Yeah.
[01:01:59] Gerard Donnelly: Yeah.
[01:01:59] Gerard Donnelly: Yeah.
[01:01:59] Gerard Donnelly: Oh, God.
[01:01:59] Gerard Donnelly: You
[01:02:07] Gerard Donnelly: I would even move the FTP to Saturday, getting to run on Friday.
[01:02:21] Gerard Donnelly: Just move that all across.
[01:02:24] Gerard Donnelly: Oh, my gosh.
[01:02:26] Abby Jorgensen: You all right?
[01:02:27] Abby Jorgensen: No, it's the dog.
[01:02:31] Abby Jorgensen: I see somebody outside, and he goes crazy.
[01:02:35] Abby Jorgensen: That's right.
[01:02:37] Abby Jorgensen: Yeah.
[01:02:53] Gerard Donnelly: Yeah, so that way, he's got run on Sunday, run on Friday.
[01:03:00] Gerard Donnelly: Ride, ride, ride.
[01:03:02] Gerard Donnelly: This week he's got two swims.
[01:03:05] Gerard Donnelly: Because of the, yeah.
[01:03:06] Abby Jorgensen: Yeah.
[01:03:07] Gerard Donnelly: And then if that's the case next week, yeah, jump him straight into, yeah.
[01:03:16] Abby Jorgensen: Oh, he's gone.
[01:03:16] Abby Jorgensen: Yeah, he's gone to Myrtle Beach and he can only run.
[01:03:20] Abby Jorgensen: Yeah, okay.
[01:03:22] Abby Jorgensen: I didn't want to run him three days in a row.
[01:03:24] Abby Jorgensen: No, you shouldn't, no.
[01:03:25] Abby Jorgensen: I wouldn't be swimming there.
[01:03:27] Gerard Donnelly: I would be swimming there.
[01:03:31] Gerard Donnelly: If he doesn't have access to a pool, bad luck, don't, don't, you know, where is he staying?
[01:03:37] Gerard Donnelly: These are the questions I'm always asking.
[01:03:38] Gerard Donnelly: Where are you staying?
[01:03:39] Gerard Donnelly: Have you got a gym nearby?
[01:03:41] Gerard Donnelly: Can you jump on a Peloton bike?
[01:03:44] Abby Jorgensen: Yeah, he, he said that he can only run, like, because they're going to a hotel with a water park, but it's, yeah, not a swim, like a lap swimming pool.
[01:03:54] Abby Jorgensen: Yeah.
[01:03:54] Abby Jorgensen: For a, so.
[01:03:57] Abby Jorgensen: Yeah, so once you do.
[01:04:00] Gerard Donnelly: We've got him running and then writing.
[01:04:04] Gerard Donnelly: That's great.
[01:04:05] Gerard Donnelly: And then I would be running here again.
[01:04:08] Gerard Donnelly: Okay.
[01:04:14] Gerard Donnelly: You all right with that?
[01:04:15] Gerard Donnelly: Yeah, fine with that.
[01:04:17] Abby Jorgensen: Yep.
[01:04:23] Gerard Donnelly: Albert.
[01:04:26] Abby Jorgensen: He's good, been super compliant, easy to work with so far.
[01:04:30] Abby Jorgensen: Yep.
[01:04:36] Abby Jorgensen: So testing.
[01:04:40] Gerard Donnelly: Good.
[01:04:41] Gerard Donnelly: So he did 190.
[01:04:45] Gerard Donnelly: I just saw your loom.
[01:04:48] Gerard Donnelly: I watched your loom.
[01:04:49] Abby Jorgensen: So that was really good.
[01:04:52] Gerard Donnelly: And his execution was fine for both ride and run.
[01:04:55] Gerard Donnelly: was great.
[01:04:56] Gerard Donnelly: And he was on the assault treadmill, wasn't he?
[01:04:58] Abby Jorgensen: Yeah.
[01:04:58] Gerard Donnelly: I feel like I'm...
[01:05:26] Gerard Donnelly: So try your best to get his four runs in.
[01:05:30] Gerard Donnelly: If you can, you've got a swim, you've got two swims, which is fine, but as long as you get, you've got four rides, which is fantastic.
[01:05:44] Gerard Donnelly: Just get another run in a, maybe on the Wednesday, it does mean he's running.
[01:05:53] Gerard Donnelly: Two days, I mean, I think two days.
[01:05:55] Gerard Donnelly: You could move that to there, was that a problem, if you moved that to there?
[01:05:58] Gerard Donnelly: Probably not.
[01:05:59] Gerard Donnelly: Yeah.
[01:05:59] Gerard Donnelly: And then...
[01:05:59] Gerard Donnelly: ...
[01:05:59] Abby Jorgensen: ...
[01:05:59] Abby Jorgensen: ...
[01:05:59] Abby Jorgensen: ...
[01:05:59] Abby Jorgensen: ...
[01:06:00] Abby Jorgensen: Can run there?
[01:06:12] Gerard Donnelly: Is that okay?
[01:06:14] Gerard Donnelly: Yeah, that should be fine.
[01:06:16] Abby Jorgensen: Yeah, because this week he's not working, so he has the time.
[01:06:22] Gerard Donnelly: What races have you got coming up?
[01:06:25] Abby Jorgensen: It's a long way away.
[01:06:28] Abby Jorgensen: Yeah, it's a while away.
[01:06:30] Abby Jorgensen: It's a 70.3 main.
[01:06:32] Abby Jorgensen: Yep.
[01:06:35] Gerard Donnelly: Okay.
[01:06:37] Gerard Donnelly: Flying through.
[01:06:38] Gerard Donnelly: Karen?
[01:06:40] Abby Jorgensen: I mean, she got a run in this weekend when she got home.
[01:06:43] Abby Jorgensen: She got home late Friday night and then got a run in Saturday.
[01:06:46] Abby Jorgensen: Yep.
[01:06:47] Gerard Donnelly: She told me just to put some things in and she has time.
[01:06:50] Abby Jorgensen: Yep.
[01:06:51] Abby Jorgensen: She'd get it.
[01:06:52] Abby Jorgensen: Yep.
[01:06:53] Abby Jorgensen: Yep.
[01:06:55] Gerard Donnelly: Just get into the habit of having a communication and saying to them, Look, I'll put put having
[01:07:00] Gerard Donnelly: The training program in, I want you to do your best, and we have an understanding that if you can't get it, we know why, but sometimes if you put nothing in, they're more than likely to do nothing, and you're not putting nothing in, but yeah, just remind them that I understand what you're going through, just do your best.
[01:07:27] Gerard Donnelly: Yeah, all right.
[01:07:30] Gerard Donnelly: Scott?
[01:07:33] Abby Jorgensen: He did really well in his first week.
[01:07:38] Abby Jorgensen: Easy to coach?
[01:07:40] Gerard Donnelly: Yeah, so far so good.
[01:07:42] Abby Jorgensen: Yeah, he did message me this morning that he caught whatever his wife and kids had last week, so he's like, I don't know when I'm, because it, again, apparently it it lasted, whatever's going around there, he's like, it lasted the whole week for them, so he's hoping it doesn't last the whole week for him, but.
[01:08:00] Gerard Donnelly: So there's nothing in your spreadsheet about his name.
[01:08:06] Gerard Donnelly: So just message Mark.
[01:08:08] Abby Jorgensen: Scott is not in there.
[01:08:10] Abby Jorgensen: Scott's not in there.
[01:08:16] Gerard Donnelly: So.
[01:08:22] Abby Jorgensen: And he's doing walk run, is it?
[01:08:26] Gerard Donnelly: Yeah, just because he doesn't have a lot of, just kind of, yeah.
[01:08:35] Gerard Donnelly: Well, he executed fine.
[01:08:39] Gerard Donnelly: Have you done a loon for him yet?
[01:08:41] Gerard Donnelly: Yeah, I did.
[01:08:43] Abby Jorgensen: I must have missed it, sorry.
[01:08:45] Abby Jorgensen: Yeah, just the ride, because he didn't test it.
[01:08:48] Abby Jorgensen: We didn't test him on anything else.
[01:08:50] Gerard Donnelly: Yeah, cadence is good.
[01:08:51] Gerard Donnelly: That's great.
[01:08:52] Gerard Donnelly: And he lifted the last two minutes.
[01:08:55] Gerard Donnelly: Beauty.
[01:08:57] Gerard Donnelly: Very good.
[01:08:59] Gerard Donnelly: Very good.
[01:09:08] Gerard Donnelly: So is this week one, is it, Abby?
[01:09:11] Gerard Donnelly: Yeah.
[01:09:12] Abby Jorgensen: Yep.
[01:09:13] Abby Jorgensen: It would have been if he's not sick the whole week.
[01:09:16] Abby Jorgensen: Yep.
[01:09:17] Abby Jorgensen: Okay.
[01:09:19] Gerard Donnelly: Let's just see how he goes.
[01:09:21] Gerard Donnelly: Yeah.
[01:09:23] Abby Jorgensen: Boston, I think it's in the U.S.
[01:09:25] Abby Jorgensen: that week, I believe.
[01:09:26] Abby Jorgensen: Yep.
[01:09:27] Gerard Donnelly: Has gym, no pool, can also run.
[01:09:33] Gerard Donnelly: Okay.
[01:09:34] Gerard Donnelly: So if he's got the gym.
[01:09:36] Gerard Donnelly: Gym bike.
[01:09:37] Abby Jorgensen: Yep.
[01:09:37] Abby Jorgensen: And he can run.
[01:09:38] Gerard Donnelly: That's great.
[01:09:40] Gerard Donnelly: Good.
[01:09:42] Gerard Donnelly: We'll try to give him, if he's well, try to give him that very first week, the strength and the VO2.
[01:09:50] Gerard Donnelly: And depending on...
[01:09:52] Abby Jorgensen: Remember with him, he wants...
[01:09:54] Abby Jorgensen: He always starts off too hot.
[01:09:57] Abby Jorgensen: I was trying to...
[01:09:58] Abby Jorgensen: Yes.
[01:09:59] Abby Jorgensen: No.
[01:10:00] Gerard Donnelly: So you've reminded me.
