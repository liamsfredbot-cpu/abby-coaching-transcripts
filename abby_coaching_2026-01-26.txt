[00:00:00] Abby Jorgensen: Okay.
[00:00:00] Abby Jorgensen: Yeah, that's one.
[00:00:02] Abby Jorgensen: 45.
[00:00:03] Abby Jorgensen: 45?
[00:00:04] Abby Jorgensen: Yeah.
[00:00:07] Gerard Donnelly: 105, 110.
[00:00:09] Gerard Donnelly: What is that?
[00:00:10] Abby Jorgensen: Let me look.
[00:00:10] Abby Jorgensen: I have you guys on my weather app, or I did at one point.
[00:00:19] Abby Jorgensen: Yeah, it says the high is going to be 114 and the low 61.
[00:00:26] Gerard Donnelly: 114.
[00:00:27] Gerard Donnelly: Oh, my God.
[00:00:29] Abby Jorgensen: That's extreme.
[00:00:30] Abby Jorgensen: Yeah, it's right now it's, let me see, change it to Celsius.
[00:00:41] Abby Jorgensen: Negative seven Celsius right now.
[00:00:44] Abby Jorgensen: Goodness.
[00:00:45] Abby Jorgensen: That's probably the high.
[00:00:47] Abby Jorgensen: That's the high.
[00:00:48] Abby Jorgensen: Yeah, I walked the, I gave in and tried to walk the dogs today, and I was like, let's, they were trying to, you know, sniff and everything.
[00:00:57] Abby Jorgensen: I'm like, we don't have time for this.
[00:00:58] Abby Jorgensen: It's too cold.
[00:00:59] Abby Jorgensen: Thank you.
[00:00:59] Abby Jorgensen: They don't seem to worry about it?
[00:01:02] Gerard Donnelly: They're okay?
[00:01:03] Abby Jorgensen: Yeah, I think they just wanted to get out a little bit more today too because we've been stuck inside for a few days.
[00:01:10] Abby Jorgensen: Is it snow and ice or is it?
[00:01:12] Gerard Donnelly: We just got a dusting of snow.
[00:01:15] Abby Jorgensen: We just got the extreme cold up here, like negative 33 windchill Fahrenheit.
[00:01:22] Abby Jorgensen: So I think that's, I don't know what that is in Celsius, but it's cold.
[00:01:29] Gerard Donnelly: So, yeah, like that way next week or so.
[00:01:33] Abby Jorgensen: Maybe not that extreme, but still cold.
[00:01:36] Gerard Donnelly: Is the outlook better or is it similar?
[00:01:40] Abby Jorgensen: It's supposed to warm up a little bit.
[00:01:42] Abby Jorgensen: By warm up, I mean like maybe into the upper 20s Fahrenheit.
[00:01:49] Abby Jorgensen: Yeah.
[00:01:51] Gerard Donnelly: Well, we've got just north of where we are, the top temperature is going to be 120 Fahrenheit.
[00:01:59] Gerard Donnelly: Yeah.
[00:02:00] Gerard Donnelly: Oh, it's going to be 49.
[00:02:03] Gerard Donnelly: You guys get humidity there or no?
[00:02:06] Abby Jorgensen: No, no humidity.
[00:02:08] Gerard Donnelly: Well, that's good at least.
[00:02:10] Abby Jorgensen: But the sun's like burning you.
[00:02:12] Gerard Donnelly: You can't let the sun on you.
[00:02:15] Gerard Donnelly: You can feel it.
[00:02:17] Gerard Donnelly: If I've got my top off, it's burning my skin within one minute.
[00:02:23] Gerard Donnelly: It's like...
[00:02:26] Gerard Donnelly: I think we're over this.
[00:02:28] Abby Jorgensen: I don't know.
[00:02:29] Abby Jorgensen: I say that.
[00:02:30] Abby Jorgensen: when it was really hot here, was complaining that it was hot here.
[00:02:34] Abby Jorgensen: So...
[00:02:34] Abby Jorgensen: Yeah.
[00:02:36] Gerard Donnelly: We're never happy.
[00:02:38] Gerard Donnelly: Can't win.
[00:02:41] Gerard Donnelly: How are you going?
[00:02:43] Gerard Donnelly: Good.
[00:02:44] Abby Jorgensen: Yeah.
[00:02:45] Abby Jorgensen: Yeah, I feel fine.
[00:02:47] Abby Jorgensen: Yeah.
[00:02:49] Gerard Donnelly: Final week of this block, so you should carry a little bit of fatigue.
[00:02:53] Gerard Donnelly: Yeah.
[00:02:55] Gerard Donnelly: How was the fun event?
[00:02:57] Gerard Donnelly: Yeah, it was fun.
[00:02:58] Abby Jorgensen: It was just, you know, a little quick.
[00:02:59] Abby Jorgensen: Yeah.
[00:03:03] Gerard Donnelly: It was bit hard to look at data, wasn't it?
[00:03:07] Abby Jorgensen: Yeah, I don't even know why my watch and everything wouldn't even.
[00:03:11] Abby Jorgensen: When I got home, I played with my heart rate strap because when I got on my treadmill back here at home to do that extra hour, it was doing the same thing.
[00:03:19] Abby Jorgensen: And so I took out the battery and put it back in and then it worked.
[00:03:24] Abby Jorgensen: So I don't know.
[00:03:25] Abby Jorgensen: So new battery or same battery?
[00:03:27] Gerard Donnelly: Same battery.
[00:03:27] Abby Jorgensen: don't know if it was just wet in there or what.
[00:03:30] Gerard Donnelly: Yeah, okay.
[00:03:33] Gerard Donnelly: It's still a great week.
[00:03:35] Gerard Donnelly: It's still, you know, still got 60-odd K, which is terrific.
[00:03:42] Gerard Donnelly: And it's good you're using the treadmill with the pacing and getting faster.
[00:03:48] Gerard Donnelly: So that's what I was keen on.
[00:03:51] Abby Jorgensen: Yeah, even yesterday, like I ended at nine miles an hour, I probably could have gone faster, but like I just didn't know.
[00:04:00] Abby Jorgensen: I mean, you're two miles and whatever.
[00:04:04] Abby Jorgensen: No, that's fine.
[00:04:10] Gerard Donnelly: Was that a different treadmill that was in the event?
[00:04:15] Abby Jorgensen: I mean, it was a different brand than the one I run here at home.
[00:04:19] Abby Jorgensen: Is it one where you run faster, it goes faster?
[00:04:24] Abby Jorgensen: It was a button one.
[00:04:26] Abby Jorgensen: Yeah.
[00:04:26] Abby Jorgensen: So is that where people really keep pushing the button?
[00:04:29] Abby Jorgensen: Yeah, I mean, I started at eight and then it took it, like, it takes a minute to get going.
[00:04:33] Abby Jorgensen: So you're like, well, you're wasting time that way.
[00:04:35] Abby Jorgensen: And then I immediately went to 8.2 and then just, like, every, like, half mile or so I, like, went up and then towards the end.
[00:04:44] Abby Jorgensen: Well, I probably could have gone faster, but.
[00:04:47] Abby Jorgensen: Yeah.
[00:04:48] Abby Jorgensen: Yeah.
[00:04:48] Gerard Donnelly: And did that have results or was it just a.
[00:04:52] Gerard Donnelly: They had a spreadsheet, but it was just.
[00:04:55] Abby Jorgensen: Impossible to understand.
[00:04:55] Abby Jorgensen: Yeah, they just put everybody's thing in there and then it, yeah, they don't do, like.
[00:05:00] Abby Jorgensen: They didn't do, like, any awards or anything.
[00:05:02] Abby Jorgensen: Yeah, no, that's good.
[00:05:03] Abby Jorgensen: I think I had, like, I think I had the second fastest run of the day.
[00:05:10] Abby Jorgensen: Yeah.
[00:05:11] Gerard Donnelly: How were they measuring the bike?
[00:05:13] Gerard Donnelly: What were they doing there?
[00:05:14] Abby Jorgensen: It was a spin bike, but it had on, I don't know, it had miles.
[00:05:18] Abby Jorgensen: So they just, when you started it and then when the seven miles hit.
[00:05:23] Abby Jorgensen: So.
[00:05:26] Gerard Donnelly: No, that's good.
[00:05:27] Gerard Donnelly: Good fun.
[00:05:31] Gerard Donnelly: Yeah, so, everything feeling okay?
[00:05:34] Gerard Donnelly: Legs feeling okay?
[00:05:36] Abby Jorgensen: Yeah, like yesterday, by the time I got done with my run, they were tired, but I felt fine today.
[00:05:43] Abby Jorgensen: Yeah, good.
[00:05:46] Gerard Donnelly: Good to be off your legs with the swim, too, isn't it?
[00:05:49] Abby Jorgensen: Yeah, that's why I love the Monday swim.
[00:05:52] Abby Jorgensen: Yeah.
[00:05:52] Abby Jorgensen: Always feels good.
[00:05:54] Abby Jorgensen: Yep.
[00:05:55] Gerard Donnelly: Good.
[00:05:55] Gerard Donnelly: Well, I accidentally deleted the session.
[00:05:59] Gerard Donnelly: be be
[00:06:00] Gerard Donnelly: I created last week.
[00:06:02] Gerard Donnelly: That's fine.
[00:06:03] Abby Jorgensen: I was so angry.
[00:06:05] Gerard Donnelly: I was like, oh, you're kidding.
[00:06:07] Gerard Donnelly: I made one for Riley this weekend because he had to go indoors too and he liked it.
[00:06:15] Gerard Donnelly: I might get you to grab that one.
[00:06:18] Gerard Donnelly: Yeah.
[00:06:19] Abby Jorgensen: You can do some variations.
[00:06:21] Abby Jorgensen: Yeah.
[00:06:22] Gerard Donnelly: I want you to progress.
[00:06:23] Gerard Donnelly: Rather than doing up and down, I want you to just gradually progress.
[00:06:32] Gerard Donnelly: Maybe in the first sort of hour and a bit, hour and a half, you can go up and down just for variation.
[00:06:39] Gerard Donnelly: But then the last section, I want you to just gradually get faster.
[00:06:45] Gerard Donnelly: So the last really 30 to 35 minutes, it's just, we just, we can run, you know, each week we can just do the long run.
[00:07:00] Gerard Donnelly: Where if you're outside, you'd just be trying to get time on your feet.
[00:07:03] Gerard Donnelly: But on the trainer, it's just mind-blowingly difficult to run the same pace the whole time.
[00:07:09] Gerard Donnelly: So vary the pace as you've been doing and then start to run with increases.
[00:07:15] Gerard Donnelly: I don't mind how quickly you increase, whether you increase every five minutes for 35 minutes or 10-minute blocks or 15-minute blocks.
[00:07:23] Gerard Donnelly: doesn't matter.
[00:07:23] Gerard Donnelly: Just making sure.
[00:07:25] Gerard Donnelly: And it should feel quite hard.
[00:07:26] Gerard Donnelly: And we're trying to run, you know, at the end at half-marathon pace.
[00:07:34] Gerard Donnelly: Yeah, so build up to marathon pace and then try and finish off the last five or 10 minutes at half-marathon pace, which will be really hard to do.
[00:07:42] Gerard Donnelly: Yeah.
[00:07:42] Gerard Donnelly: What is, what's my predicted marathon pace right now?
[00:07:47] Abby Jorgensen: Yeah, what do we do?
[00:07:49] Gerard Donnelly: Let me look at you.
[00:07:55] Gerard Donnelly: So, it is a while ago since we've...
[00:08:03] Gerard Donnelly: So when was the last 10k, that was 46 minutes, where that predicts you at 3.38 marathon, so 5.10 kilometre pace, Abby, so what's that in miles?
[00:08:24] Abby Jorgensen: Probably like an 8.15 maybe?
[00:08:28] Gerard Donnelly: Yeah, well, yeah, so, and some 5-minute k pace for half marathon, so that would be a bit quicker.
[00:08:37] Abby Jorgensen: Yeah, think half marathon is, my last one was 7.53 per mile.
[00:08:45] Abby Jorgensen: Yes, okay.
[00:08:53] Gerard Donnelly: So, that was the 1.43 run you did?
[00:08:56] Gerard Donnelly: Yeah.
[00:08:56] Gerard Donnelly: Back in October.
[00:08:57] Abby Jorgensen: October.
[00:08:58] Gerard Donnelly: So,.43 run you did.
[00:09:00] Gerard Donnelly: was 453 kilometre pace.
[00:09:02] Gerard Donnelly: So what does that give you in miles?
[00:09:05] Gerard Donnelly: 753, I think.
[00:09:07] Gerard Donnelly: So if you can try to run under 8-minute mile pace for the last 10 to 15 minutes, that would be a good achievement.
[00:09:18] Gerard Donnelly: Okay.
[00:09:19] Gerard Donnelly: After, you know, 1 hour 50 on the treadmill.
[00:09:25] Gerard Donnelly: All right?
[00:09:26] Abby Jorgensen: All right.
[00:09:27] Gerard Donnelly: And then we'll, there's no, there's no, there's no, no events for you.
[00:09:33] Gerard Donnelly: So when we do the next week, when we do the, the 10K run, I'll have to be on the treadmill.
[00:09:40] Abby Jorgensen: Unless we get random warm-up, but.
[00:09:43] Abby Jorgensen: Yeah, unless it's not icy.
[00:09:44] Gerard Donnelly: If it's not icy and it's just cold, the ice is a problem.
[00:09:50] Gerard Donnelly: Oh, the cold's a problem, I'll get to do it.
[00:09:53] Gerard Donnelly: Yeah.
[00:09:54] Gerard Donnelly: So, but yeah, yeah, ideally you just want to pick the best day on, especially.
[00:10:00] Gerard Donnelly: the next week, it's recovery week, so we can move the whole week around, so yeah, the swim's a swim, and the ride's just trying to start conservatively and see if we're maintaining still, but the run we want to actually push it, where you've still got to execute conservatively and finish strong, but we want you to have a mindset, instead of, you know, if we were in July, we would be trying to put you into a 10k race, where you're getting pushed, but you're on your own, it's freezing cold, there's not a lot of expectation of quality, but we want you to feel, so the time's not kind of relevant, it's more, you're really pushing yourself.
[00:10:59] Gerard Donnelly: Thank
[00:11:00] Gerard Donnelly: And remember, it's January and you're not meant to be in, you know, your best form in January.
[00:11:06] Abby Jorgensen: Yeah.
[00:11:07] Abby Jorgensen: I mean, I even felt on that treadmill run yesterday, like my heart rate got up to like 171, I think, or I don't know.
[00:11:14] Abby Jorgensen: But I didn't, I wasn't like breathing heavy, if that makes sense.
[00:11:18] Abby Jorgensen: Yeah, good.
[00:11:20] Abby Jorgensen: Running at that.
[00:11:22] Abby Jorgensen: Yeah.
[00:11:23] Gerard Donnelly: But even doing that race today, as was, it's still a competition where you're not training by yourself you've got others around you where your mindset's different i've got a couple of athletes over here who just blow my mind there's one girl rachel i can't get her to train hard and as soon as she goes to a race i might so when she does like these three ten minute efforts or five by six or any intervals that i give her she's you know
[00:12:00] Gerard Donnelly: Run an eight to half to nine minute mile pace and put her into an event and she can run, you know, 7.30 mile pace.
[00:12:11] Gerard Donnelly: It doesn't make sense.
[00:12:13] Gerard Donnelly: It's just, you can't push yourself by herself.
[00:12:16] Gerard Donnelly: As soon as she's in a race, so I had a prediction for her half marathon at 1.44 and she ran 1.36.
[00:12:26] Abby Jorgensen: It was crazy.
[00:12:29] Gerard Donnelly: You know, I just said to her, what, Rachel, how, I don't understand how you're doing this when you can't do it in training.
[00:12:37] Gerard Donnelly: And she's confused as well.
[00:12:38] Gerard Donnelly: She's going, oh, just, when there's people around me, I just really, I can really push myself.
[00:12:44] Gerard Donnelly: And she still starts conservatively, but becomes something like steam train.
[00:12:50] Gerard Donnelly: So the advantage of having competition is just, it can't be underestimated.
[00:12:57] Gerard Donnelly: And for all of your athletes that you're coaching.
[00:12:59] Gerard Donnelly: you.
[00:12:59] Gerard Donnelly: Thank Thank Thank
[00:13:00] Gerard Donnelly: Any opportunity you get, even in the testing week, know, for cycling, I try to get people into a cycling time trial if there's any around.
[00:13:10] Gerard Donnelly: I ask all my athletes, you know, is there any local events that you can jump into rather than do it by yourself, especially the fun runners.
[00:13:19] Gerard Donnelly: You know, we're lucky in Australia where we've got a park run every Saturday, almost all over Australia.
[00:13:26] Gerard Donnelly: So it's such an advantage to be able to throw people into a park run.
[00:13:30] Gerard Donnelly: Because you know they're there every Saturday and, you know, most, like in Melbourne, there's probably 20 different park runs that you can do.
[00:13:38] Gerard Donnelly: So you only have to travel 10, 15 minutes before you're in another park run area.
[00:13:46] Gerard Donnelly: And I guarantee the majority of people run better in the park run than they would do in a solo at 5K.
[00:13:52] Gerard Donnelly: I mean, I know I do.
[00:13:54] Abby Jorgensen: Yeah, you've just got that competition.
[00:13:56] Gerard Donnelly: And even though you're still running, executing the way you want to.
[00:13:59] Gerard Donnelly: know.
[00:13:59] Gerard Donnelly: know.
[00:13:59] Gerard Donnelly: I
[00:14:00] Gerard Donnelly: It's just that you've got people around you that changes your mindset from, boy, this is hard to, oh, who can I catch?
[00:14:08] Gerard Donnelly: Who can I beat?
[00:14:09] Gerard Donnelly: You're thinking about other things.
[00:14:10] Gerard Donnelly: It's another great example of thinking about the right things rather than the pain you're feeling.
[00:14:17] Gerard Donnelly: And I just did a session this morning on the Validorme and, you know, I was doing five by five minute efforts and I got to two and a half minutes of the last or second last effort.
[00:14:28] Gerard Donnelly: And I was thinking, oh, God, I've got another two and half minutes of this.
[00:14:31] Gerard Donnelly: And then I started thinking pedaling technique and really concentrating on pulling up and pushing down.
[00:14:39] Gerard Donnelly: And before I knew it, I'd done another two laps and, you know, concentrating on something other than this is getting harder.
[00:14:48] Gerard Donnelly: And that's kind of tricking your brain into, you know, concentrating on things are going to be helpful rather than Jesus is getting hard.
[00:14:58] Gerard Donnelly: So, yeah, so they're the thing.
[00:15:00] Gerard Donnelly: If you practice that in training, come race day, it becomes automatic that you start concentrating.
[00:15:05] Gerard Donnelly: In the race, you're concentrating on other things anyway, the wind direction and stuff.
[00:15:13] Gerard Donnelly: Yeah.
[00:15:13] Abby Jorgensen: I think even the FTP, my mindset has changed.
[00:15:17] Abby Jorgensen: doesn't seem to get hard until 14 or 15 now, when before it was like eight minutes in, you're like, oh, no.
[00:15:24] Abby Jorgensen: Yeah.
[00:15:26] Gerard Donnelly: And even then, just think about pedalling technique and pulling up and pushing down and trying to be smooth and, yeah.
[00:15:37] Gerard Donnelly: Anything else?
[00:15:38] Gerard Donnelly: So, we've got, still got a fair bit of time before the big, you know, before the summer season starts.
[00:15:51] Gerard Donnelly: So, but, yeah, doing all this work right now, Abby's going to set you up really well.
[00:15:59] Abby Jorgensen: Yeah.
[00:16:00] Abby Jorgensen: I don't mind not having, like, my big races till later because, yeah, it's going get better.
[00:16:06] Gerard Donnelly: Yeah, it gives you more time.
[00:16:07] Gerard Donnelly: Yeah, not stressed about anything, so.
[00:16:10] Abby Jorgensen: Yeah.
[00:16:12] Gerard Donnelly: How did you go with coaching this week?
[00:16:14] Gerard Donnelly: Good, I think, yeah.
[00:16:16] Abby Jorgensen: I mean, I had to move some things around for people with the weather and stuff, but everybody was almost in the same boat, so it helped.
[00:16:26] Gerard Donnelly: Yeah, and because you're in touch with that, you know, anybody you coached in Australia today, you would be going, why didn't you do your session?
[00:16:34] Gerard Donnelly: And they'd be going, you know, if I didn't train before, like, it's 9 o'clock now, I got up at 5 and trained, I drove to the velodrome, which is a 40-minute drive, so that this afternoon, I don't have that dilemma of, it's too frigging hot to train.
[00:16:52] Gerard Donnelly: So it's done, and they need, you know, you would need to know what's happening in every country is temperature.
[00:16:59] Gerard Donnelly: It's the health.
[00:17:00] Gerard Donnelly: And that's not an easy thing to do.
[00:17:02] Gerard Donnelly: Yeah.
[00:17:03] Gerard Donnelly: So, yeah.
[00:17:05] Gerard Donnelly: Okay.
[00:17:06] Gerard Donnelly: How's Coco going with the camp?
[00:17:14] Abby Jorgensen: I think she's over it, actually.
[00:17:17] Abby Jorgensen: This morning, just didn't, like, she's like, man, they just try to cram everything in, like, a full day instead of, like, actually teaching these athletes things.
[00:17:26] Abby Jorgensen: And I'm like, that's the problem with these type of camps.
[00:17:30] Abby Jorgensen: It's all about just volume and junk miles, the experience versus actually, I think.
[00:17:38] Gerard Donnelly: It's just, it's kind of seeing how hard we can train.
[00:17:41] Gerard Donnelly: Is that what they're sort of doing?
[00:17:42] Abby Jorgensen: Yeah.
[00:17:43] Abby Jorgensen: But I think the rides, I mean, she claims that most of the participants are pretty amateur.
[00:17:48] Abby Jorgensen: So, like, she's complaining that she doesn't think she's riding hard enough.
[00:17:54] Abby Jorgensen: Well, she probably isn't.
[00:17:55] Abby Jorgensen: Yeah, like, you know, like, you're still, like, 35 hours.
[00:18:00] Abby Jorgensen: Stuff, last week.
[00:18:02] Abby Jorgensen: Yeah.
[00:18:08] Gerard Donnelly: It's only got a couple more days, aren't you?
[00:18:11] Gerard Donnelly: Yeah, the rest of this, most of this week.
[00:18:15] Abby Jorgensen: And then she heads away, I guess.
[00:18:18] Abby Jorgensen: Headed to Australia.
[00:18:20] Gerard Donnelly: Tommy, who she's staying with, who I coach, has been sick for two weeks.
[00:18:27] Gerard Donnelly: So she's going to stay with him, hopefully.
[00:18:30] Gerard Donnelly: I don't know what, he just can't get over this virus that he's got.
[00:18:35] Gerard Donnelly: Seems to be a lot of random stuff going around.
[00:18:39] Abby Jorgensen: Yeah.
[00:18:40] Gerard Donnelly: So she's to see Brenton, is she?
[00:18:41] Gerard Donnelly: Fantastic.
[00:18:42] Abby Jorgensen: Yeah.
[00:18:43] Gerard Donnelly: That's really good.
[00:18:45] Abby Jorgensen: Yeah, she set up, yeah, something with him.
[00:18:48] Abby Jorgensen: I know she told me, so.
[00:18:51] Gerard Donnelly: That'd be good to do that.
[00:18:53] Gerard Donnelly: That rice.
[00:18:54] Gerard Donnelly: That one?
[00:18:55] Abby Jorgensen: Okay.
[00:18:55] Abby Jorgensen: Is that there?
[00:18:57] Abby Jorgensen: Is that in Australia?
[00:18:59] Abby Jorgensen: It's in Melbourne,
[00:19:02] Gerard Donnelly: That race, stupidly, Australia doesn't have a lot of races compared to the rest of the world, so Geelong 70.3 is on that day, the race in Melbourne is on that day, and the T100 in the Gold Coast is on that day, so there's three major races on the same day.
[00:19:25] Gerard Donnelly: I mean, you know, we don't have that many races, so spread them out.
[00:19:29] Gerard Donnelly: All the race organisers know that there's races on that day, but they still go ahead and do it.
[00:19:37] Gerard Donnelly: Yeah, so once she's here, we could do that race, but we wouldn't taper her into that race.
[00:19:52] Gerard Donnelly: We get her to do a race-ready big day that day, and she's you know, she's going into the race for...
[00:20:03] Gerard Donnelly: And I know she's competitive and she wants to win things and she probably would go pretty well, but it's not her race, you know, and you have to get that across to her.
[00:20:12] Gerard Donnelly: If you want to do this race, I've talked to Gerard, it's fine to do, but we just want to do it so that we can get, you know, a good 40k time trial into your legs after you've done and do a 10k run.
[00:20:27] Gerard Donnelly: So we'll do a long ride on Saturday with a little run off the bike, but she probably might have a little bit of jet lag anyway, flying, you know, it's a friggin' long way, Abby, on the plane.
[00:20:43] Abby Jorgensen: From where she's coming from?
[00:20:45] Abby Jorgensen: Yeah, it's like 20-something hours, 25 hours of travelling.
[00:20:49] Gerard Donnelly: It's a whole day.
[00:20:54] Abby Jorgensen: It's a day, right?
[00:20:57] Gerard Donnelly: She arrives on Wednesday.
[00:20:58] Gerard Donnelly: She
[00:21:00] Gerard Donnelly: At midnight, so the next possible training day is Thursday.
[00:21:05] Gerard Donnelly: That's what I mean.
[00:21:06] Gerard Donnelly: So she leaves Tuesday, and she arrives midnight Wednesday.
[00:21:12] Gerard Donnelly: Well, thank you.
[00:21:15] Abby Jorgensen: Yeah, I mean, I've always wanted to come over there and visit, but that is a long flight.
[00:21:22] Abby Jorgensen: Yeah.
[00:21:23] Abby Jorgensen: It's probably even longer.
[00:21:25] Gerard Donnelly: Ironically, when we come from here to the States, say I left today at lunchtime, I would get there, like, today at two o'clock.
[00:21:39] Gerard Donnelly: You'd, like, gain it.
[00:21:40] Abby Jorgensen: You wouldn't even lose anything.
[00:21:41] Abby Jorgensen: No, I don't lose anything.
[00:21:42] Abby Jorgensen: And then coming home, I'd lose a whole day.
[00:21:45] Gerard Donnelly: Like, I would leave today and get home two days later.
[00:21:52] Abby Jorgensen: This is bizarre.
[00:21:57] Gerard Donnelly: This is bizarre.
[00:21:57] Gerard Donnelly: This is bizarre.
[00:21:59] Gerard Donnelly: bizarre.
[00:21:59] Gerard Donnelly: bizarre.
[00:21:59] Gerard Donnelly: bizarre.
[00:21:59] Gerard Donnelly: bizarre.
[00:21:59] Gerard Donnelly: This bizarre.
[00:22:00] Gerard Donnelly: So, it would have been a bit of a nightmare for you, trying to schedule this.
[00:22:07] Abby Jorgensen: Yeah, so we, she moved her, she did a 40-20 today, she moved that, she had something tomorrow, but she's getting, she got into Harder Rides last week.
[00:22:22] Abby Jorgensen: Like, Saturday, I had to talk her away from doing, she wanted to do it, like, something else, else hard, and I was like, no, but then she still went and rode three, three hours on Saturday.
[00:22:33] Abby Jorgensen: I was like, you have a long run.
[00:22:40] Abby Jorgensen: I think she just thought that she wasn't going to get enough, and I was like, you're fine, like.
[00:22:46] Gerard Donnelly: Yeah, 500 kilometers, bloody hell, in 65.
[00:22:49] Gerard Donnelly: Yeah, that's what I said, was like, it may be low intensity, but it's still, like, it's a lot of time on the bike.
[00:22:56] Gerard Donnelly: Yeah, I mean, you're really doing the right thing here.
[00:22:58] Gerard Donnelly: Yeah.
[00:23:00] Gerard Donnelly: And she needs, you know, again, if you need me to put in, I will.
[00:23:04] Gerard Donnelly: Yeah.
[00:23:05] Abby Jorgensen: think she, like this morning, she sent me a message.
[00:23:08] Abby Jorgensen: think she, everything's just caught up to her because she doesn't get a, she stays in a bunk with other people too.
[00:23:14] Abby Jorgensen: So that's not, she's not used to that and she doesn't get alone time.
[00:23:19] Abby Jorgensen: And I was like, yeah, that's the price you pay for those type of things, I guess.
[00:23:25] Abby Jorgensen: Yeah.
[00:23:26] Abby Jorgensen: Such a routine person, which I get, but.
[00:23:29] Abby Jorgensen: Yeah.
[00:23:30] Gerard Donnelly: Well, she's not really hitting the numbers.
[00:23:32] Gerard Donnelly: That's purely fatigue, I'd say.
[00:23:34] Abby Jorgensen: Yeah.
[00:23:35] Abby Jorgensen: That's what she was talking about this morning.
[00:23:37] Abby Jorgensen: I was like, yeah, you know, would have been okay for you not to do that today.
[00:23:42] Abby Jorgensen: Yeah.
[00:23:42] Abby Jorgensen: She had already done it by the time I got up, so.
[00:23:45] Abby Jorgensen: Yeah.
[00:23:47] Gerard Donnelly: And like, she's literally 60 watts below the range and her cadence is 80.
[00:23:55] Gerard Donnelly: Yeah.
[00:23:57] Gerard Donnelly: She almost needed a recovery from this, again.
[00:24:01] Gerard Donnelly: You know, you've got to be super careful.
[00:24:08] Gerard Donnelly: Grand final.
[00:24:09] Gerard Donnelly: What's the grand final tour?
[00:24:11] Gerard Donnelly: It's probably the final bike ride that they're doing.
[00:24:14] Abby Jorgensen: I don't know.
[00:24:16] Abby Jorgensen: Okay.
[00:24:17] Abby Jorgensen: That's what I'm guessing.
[00:24:19] Abby Jorgensen: Yeah.
[00:24:22] Gerard Donnelly: All right.
[00:24:22] Gerard Donnelly: Well, I'd be, I'd be with travel and just be careful, Abby.
[00:24:32] Gerard Donnelly: And, you know, how are you and I keep saying, I've discussed this with Gerard, you know, this has been huge volume.
[00:24:41] Gerard Donnelly: Even though you haven't got the intensity you want, you're still carrying massive fatigue.
[00:24:47] Gerard Donnelly: And you just need to trust the process so that, you know, the flight will come at a good time, actually.
[00:24:53] Gerard Donnelly: You'll force it to rest.
[00:24:55] Abby Jorgensen: Yeah.
[00:24:59] Gerard Donnelly: Maybe the...
[00:25:00] Abby Jorgensen: The weather there, too, will force her just to get it over with early in the day, and then she has no other thing but the rest.
[00:25:08] Gerard Donnelly: But that session is the example you use.
[00:25:11] Gerard Donnelly: You know, you couldn't do it.
[00:25:14] Gerard Donnelly: You know, because you've got so much, I can't push.
[00:25:17] Gerard Donnelly: I can't push more, can't increase cadence.
[00:25:22] Gerard Donnelly: You know, I can't do it.
[00:25:24] Gerard Donnelly: And why?
[00:25:26] Gerard Donnelly: Why can't you do it, Coco?
[00:25:27] Gerard Donnelly: Okay, because you're just exhausted.
[00:25:31] Gerard Donnelly: You Yep.
[00:25:35] Gerard Donnelly: You okay with that?
[00:25:36] Gerard Donnelly: Yeah.
[00:25:39] Gerard Donnelly: What?
[00:25:42] Gerard Donnelly: Doogie?
[00:25:44] Abby Jorgensen: I had a good talk with him Saturday.
[00:25:48] Abby Jorgensen: So he said that this week he should be able to, especially the back half of the week, he should be able to get in because he's traveling and stuff.
[00:25:57] Abby Jorgensen: But he definitely was.
[00:26:00] Abby Jorgensen: I was like, if you can find a park run, do it.
[00:26:05] Abby Jorgensen: So he said it depends.
[00:26:07] Abby Jorgensen: Like a lot of them are on trails and really muddy right now.
[00:26:11] Abby Jorgensen: So I was like, yeah, just use the best judgment.
[00:26:16] Gerard Donnelly: And just remind him that he hasn't trained on the bike or running specifically for this.
[00:26:21] Gerard Donnelly: So he needs to have the lowest expectations possible.
[00:26:25] Gerard Donnelly: And you've really got to send that message to him, whether you talk to him or whether you send a text message, you know, whatever you think, drop it.
[00:26:34] Gerard Donnelly: Drop the expectation.
[00:26:36] Abby Jorgensen: Yeah.
[00:26:37] Gerard Donnelly: This is like starting again.
[00:26:39] Gerard Donnelly: For him, you know, we don't care about the mud.
[00:26:42] Gerard Donnelly: It's just going for a solid run, you know.
[00:26:48] Gerard Donnelly: And what was the last, what was the last thing he, it must be a long time ago, wasn't it?
[00:26:56] Gerard Donnelly: October's the last 20 minutes he did.
[00:26:58] Gerard Donnelly: Yeah.
[00:26:59] Abby Jorgensen: He did a few.
[00:27:00] Abby Jorgensen: A like, of those bike swift races that he ended up, like, getting a new FTP out of, but they weren't, like, FTPs.
[00:27:10] Gerard Donnelly: So, you know, I would say he should be starting around 200 watts.
[00:27:16] Gerard Donnelly: Even though his last effort was 265 in October, that's what I'll be saying to him.
[00:27:22] Gerard Donnelly: Just start.
[00:27:22] Gerard Donnelly: Start at ridiculously low number and just keep progressing.
[00:27:26] Gerard Donnelly: But don't start at 260 and finish at 180.
[00:27:33] Gerard Donnelly: His 5K run in November, he ran 22.25, which is not too bad.
[00:27:38] Gerard Donnelly: No.
[00:27:39] Abby Jorgensen: And he's been running, obviously, with high rocks, so.
[00:27:41] Abby Jorgensen: Yeah.
[00:27:42] Gerard Donnelly: But still, get him to start at 450 pace.
[00:27:47] Gerard Donnelly: He ran 4.30 pace.
[00:27:49] Gerard Donnelly: Yeah, I'm trying to remember.
[00:27:50] Abby Jorgensen: You can probably see, I'm trying to remember what his, because there's an app for, I followed his high rocks.
[00:27:57] Abby Jorgensen: I'm trying to remember what he was running, his 1Ks.
[00:28:00] Abby Jorgensen: Yeah.
[00:28:03] Abby Jorgensen: Check that out as well.
[00:28:06] Gerard Donnelly: But just really drum into him.
[00:28:08] Gerard Donnelly: We don't expect anything but you just getting a starting point to train to.
[00:28:18] Gerard Donnelly: And our philosophy is be conservative early and enjoy coming home strong.
[00:28:23] Gerard Donnelly: You know, you want that for yourself.
[00:28:26] Gerard Donnelly: I want that for myself.
[00:28:27] Gerard Donnelly: Like, you know, today's five by five.
[00:28:30] Gerard Donnelly: I think my first one was 265.
[00:28:32] Gerard Donnelly: My last one was 275.
[00:28:33] Gerard Donnelly: You know, even I'm thinking about that every, because I'm unsure, you know, exactly how I'm feeling.
[00:28:40] Gerard Donnelly: I've got actually a new power meter, so it's really screwing everything up.
[00:28:44] Gerard Donnelly: But you just don't know, you know, and you're better off finishing the session strong rather than, you know, going for it early and not finishing.
[00:28:53] Gerard Donnelly: So yeah, he's good.
[00:28:56] Abby Jorgensen: Andrew?
[00:28:57] Gerard Donnelly: He's good.
[00:28:58] Gerard Donnelly: He's in Phoenix right now, but...
[00:28:59] Abby Jorgensen: He's but...
[00:29:00] Abby Jorgensen: We have everything sorted out, so.
[00:29:04] Gerard Donnelly: Is he got enough equipment he can ride?
[00:29:09] Abby Jorgensen: Yeah, he's going to check out the hotel.
[00:29:12] Abby Jorgensen: If not, we're going to figure something out.
[00:29:14] Abby Jorgensen: But I wanted him to at least get his running in because that's our main goal initially.
[00:29:21] Abby Jorgensen: Good.
[00:29:25] Gerard Donnelly: So he's going to get four runs in.
[00:29:27] Gerard Donnelly: That's great, Abby.
[00:29:27] Abby Jorgensen: Yeah.
[00:29:30] Gerard Donnelly: And what did do last week?
[00:29:31] Gerard Donnelly: 28, okay, 30.
[00:29:33] Gerard Donnelly: Yeah, so we want to keep it above that in 17.
[00:29:38] Gerard Donnelly: So that was testing week, though.
[00:29:40] Gerard Donnelly: Yeah, so just keep pushing the duration.
[00:29:44] Gerard Donnelly: Don't worry too much about the intensity, but that's good.
[00:29:50] Gerard Donnelly: How's Shingo?
[00:29:52] Gerard Donnelly: He's good.
[00:29:54] Abby Jorgensen: He says he tests this week.
[00:29:58] Abby Jorgensen: I moved it around.
[00:29:59] Abby Jorgensen: I I
[00:30:00] Abby Jorgensen: He has the day off.
[00:30:00] Abby Jorgensen: He wanted the test on his day off, and he didn't get his swim in today, but he said it's fine, because I just talked to him.
[00:30:10] Abby Jorgensen: But, like, next week, I think he gets his wisdom teeth out next week, I think it was.
[00:30:16] Abby Jorgensen: Yeah, okay.
[00:30:16] Abby Jorgensen: Other than that, that's the only thing where we'll have to move around.
[00:30:23] Abby Jorgensen: Yeah, he's got 13 weeks.
[00:30:25] Gerard Donnelly: It'll come around quickly.
[00:30:26] Abby Jorgensen: Yeah, but he's been doing really good, so.
[00:30:30] Abby Jorgensen: Yeah, he's trying well.
[00:30:32] Abby Jorgensen: He's easy.
[00:30:33] Abby Jorgensen: Chris?
[00:30:34] Gerard Donnelly: He's also easy.
[00:30:35] Abby Jorgensen: I mean, he was in Colorado this weekend, and he missed, he called me.
[00:30:43] Abby Jorgensen: He has that, remember, I don't know if you remember from his interview, he has that extra bone in his foot, and he thinks the half marathon and just kind of pissed it off a little bit.
[00:30:53] Abby Jorgensen: So, he took the weekend off just to give himself.
[00:30:59] Abby Jorgensen: So, Barbara.
[00:30:59] Abby Jorgensen: So, yeah.
[00:30:59] Abby Jorgensen: you.
[00:31:02] Gerard Donnelly: Was he happy with his run?
[00:31:03] Gerard Donnelly: Yeah, it was a PR, so he was very happy with it.
[00:31:11] Gerard Donnelly: Wow.
[00:31:15] Gerard Donnelly: That's unbelievable, isn't it?
[00:31:16] Abby Jorgensen: Yeah, it was a pretty hilly course, too.
[00:31:19] Abby Jorgensen: So he did really well.
[00:31:21] Gerard Donnelly: And his execution is great.
[00:31:23] Gerard Donnelly: Yeah.
[00:31:25] Abby Jorgensen: Almost had PRs within, like, 20 seconds off of PRs, 20, 30 seconds.
[00:31:30] Abby Jorgensen: didn't Yeah.
[00:31:32] Abby Jorgensen: That's really well done.
[00:31:37] Gerard Donnelly: And so he's just started conservatively, and just progressively got quicker.
[00:31:42] Abby Jorgensen: That's fantastic.
[00:31:44] Gerard Donnelly: Did you put that in for math?
[00:31:47] Gerard Donnelly: Yeah, I probably did.
[00:31:49] Abby Jorgensen: Pretty sure I did.
[00:31:49] Abby Jorgensen: That was, like, two weeks ago.
[00:31:51] Abby Jorgensen: Yeah.
[00:31:52] Gerard Donnelly: So.
[00:31:55] Gerard Donnelly: Good.
[00:31:58] Gerard Donnelly: Thanks.
[00:31:59] Gerard Donnelly: Thank
[00:32:00] Gerard Donnelly: Okay.
[00:32:01] Gerard Donnelly: What's he got coming up soon?
[00:32:04] Abby Jorgensen: What do want to call it?
[00:32:06] Abby Jorgensen: Oceanside.
[00:32:06] Abby Jorgensen: Oceanside.
[00:32:08] Abby Jorgensen: You happy with his progress?
[00:32:10] Abby Jorgensen: Yeah.
[00:32:11] Abby Jorgensen: He's very communicative and loves the data.
[00:32:15] Abby Jorgensen: So that's it.
[00:32:16] Abby Jorgensen: It's only eight weeks.
[00:32:18] Gerard Donnelly: It's going to come right in a week.
[00:32:19] Gerard Donnelly: Yeah.
[00:32:20] Gerard Donnelly: It wasn't like his main.
[00:32:21] Abby Jorgensen: He knew when he, remember when he signed up.
[00:32:23] Abby Jorgensen: I know it's not optimal, but.
[00:32:27] Abby Jorgensen: Yep.
[00:32:29] Gerard Donnelly: Is he living in California?
[00:32:31] Gerard Donnelly: Yeah.
[00:32:32] Abby Jorgensen: L.A.
[00:32:33] Abby Jorgensen: Yep.
[00:32:33] Abby Jorgensen: Okay.
[00:32:34] Abby Jorgensen: Right there by Pasadena.
[00:32:36] Abby Jorgensen: Yes, that's right.
[00:32:37] Abby Jorgensen: Yep.
[00:32:38] Gerard Donnelly: Yeah.
[00:32:38] Abby Jorgensen: His pool is, I mean, I'm a big, like, I love football and like he lives right by the Rose Bowl.
[00:32:43] Abby Jorgensen: Oh, does he?
[00:32:44] Abby Jorgensen: I guess there's an outdoor pool right, right there by the Rose Bowl that he swims at.
[00:32:50] Abby Jorgensen: Fantastic.
[00:32:51] Abby Jorgensen: Yeah.
[00:32:53] Abby Jorgensen: Good stuff.
[00:32:55] Gerard Donnelly: Anything else on here?
[00:32:57] Gerard Donnelly: Nope.
[00:32:58] Abby Jorgensen: He's doing good.
[00:33:00] Gerard Donnelly: Kevin?
[00:33:01] Gerard Donnelly: Kevin also doing well.
[00:33:03] Abby Jorgensen: His PT told him he could go a little faster.
[00:33:08] Abby Jorgensen: Jesus, this is a long drawing.
[00:33:10] Abby Jorgensen: Yeah, he goes two more weeks at whatever you're doing.
[00:33:13] Abby Jorgensen: was two weeks or this is this will be the second week at the increased speed.
[00:33:18] Abby Jorgensen: And then he was going to give him something else or take down the incline, I think is what Kevin said.
[00:33:28] Abby Jorgensen: Yeah.
[00:33:28] Abby Jorgensen: Thank God.
[00:33:30] Abby Jorgensen: I know.
[00:33:31] Abby Jorgensen: I can't imagine 12%.
[00:33:36] Gerard Donnelly: That's just – I just don't agree with it.
[00:33:42] Gerard Donnelly: I don't either, but – How's he writing?
[00:33:52] Gerard Donnelly: He's writing really good.
[00:33:54] Abby Jorgensen: He's one that I don't – he's gone from – let me see.
[00:33:58] Abby Jorgensen: Kevin.
[00:33:59] Abby Jorgensen: Kevin.
[00:33:59] Abby Jorgensen: Kevin.
[00:34:00] Abby Jorgensen: Kevin, it's gone from 218 to 295 and that's great.
[00:34:08] Gerard Donnelly: I don't know.
[00:34:09] Abby Jorgensen: What is that?
[00:34:09] Abby Jorgensen: One, two, three, four, five months.
[00:34:12] Abby Jorgensen: Yeah.
[00:34:18] Gerard Donnelly: His swim's going right too.
[00:34:20] Abby Jorgensen: Yeah, his swim, he said something just clicked last time.
[00:34:28] Gerard Donnelly: All right.
[00:34:29] Gerard Donnelly: Yeah.
[00:34:30] Gerard Donnelly: Going good with him?
[00:34:31] Gerard Donnelly: Yeah.
[00:34:33] Gerard Donnelly: Richard?
[00:34:37] Abby Jorgensen: Richard, we were just texting back and forth.
[00:34:40] Abby Jorgensen: trying to figure out the right – I told him his 10 – he's never run a 10K with us because he just switched to wanting to do Olympic distance.
[00:34:51] Abby Jorgensen: Yeah.
[00:34:52] Abby Jorgensen: And so we were trying to – I told him where to start for his 10K and he doesn't know if that's possible, but –
[00:35:00] Abby Jorgensen: Too aggressive, he thinks?
[00:35:02] Gerard Donnelly: Yeah, he thinks it's too aggressive.
[00:35:04] Abby Jorgensen: Did you look at McMillan from what he did in January?
[00:35:07] Gerard Donnelly: Yep.
[00:35:08] Abby Jorgensen: I just had that pulled up.
[00:35:10] Abby Jorgensen: Let's see here.
[00:35:14] Abby Jorgensen: Yeah, it says he can run a 59.22.10K, which is a 9.33 mile pace.
[00:35:22] Abby Jorgensen: Yep.
[00:35:23] Gerard Donnelly: So I told him to start around like 9.45.
[00:35:27] Abby Jorgensen: Yep.
[00:35:28] Abby Jorgensen: And he questioned that, but I was like, then he was like, well, maybe I just need to believe I can do it.
[00:35:33] Abby Jorgensen: I'm like, sometimes that's all it takes if you never really don't know until you try.
[00:35:39] Gerard Donnelly: Yep, good.
[00:35:39] Gerard Donnelly: And telling him to stay there for as long as he needs to and then start to pick it up.
[00:35:48] Abby Jorgensen: At least I was thinking the right thing.
[00:35:50] Abby Jorgensen: Yeah.
[00:35:53] Abby Jorgensen: But yeah, other than that, like he was going to do a race and we had a conversation last night.
[00:35:58] Abby Jorgensen: There was a race in.-hmm.
[00:36:01] Abby Jorgensen: March, we deleted it, and then you decided there's like an actual, this April one he's going to do instead.
[00:36:09] Abby Jorgensen: It just gives them more time to train and get ready for that.
[00:36:16] Gerard Donnelly: Orange County.
[00:36:21] Gerard Donnelly: It's reaching LA as well?
[00:36:24] Gerard Donnelly: Yeah, right around there.
[00:36:26] Abby Jorgensen: So I think those are the only, my only two in there right now since Peter was out in that area, but.
[00:36:45] Abby Jorgensen: Yeah, that was his first time not, like he, he didn't go with the bunch, he slept in, he said, and then went out on his own, so.
[00:36:56] Abby Jorgensen: So I guess that's not really, is that, no, it's outside of LA.
[00:37:00] Abby Jorgensen: little bit.
[00:37:00] Abby Jorgensen: Yeah, it's.
[00:37:03] Gerard Donnelly: Oh, yeah, still kind of.
[00:37:07] Abby Jorgensen: Yeah, Monica area.
[00:37:17] Abby Jorgensen: Arlington Beach.
[00:37:19] Abby Jorgensen: Arlington Beach, Newport.
[00:37:22] Gerard Donnelly: I'm coming in July to stay there.
[00:37:26] Gerard Donnelly: Our friends live there.
[00:37:28] Gerard Donnelly: Yeah, and I've ridden that road there a lot and down all the way down to.
[00:37:36] Gerard Donnelly: I've been to Newport once.
[00:37:38] Abby Jorgensen: Yeah, all the down to there.
[00:37:40] Gerard Donnelly: Quite a good road.
[00:37:42] Gerard Donnelly: It's been a while.
[00:37:45] Gerard Donnelly: I think I've got really good hills in here.
[00:37:49] Gerard Donnelly: Yeah.
[00:37:51] Abby Jorgensen: Fantastic.
[00:37:53] Gerard Donnelly: So that's good.
[00:37:55] Gerard Donnelly: He could also ride in through here if he wanted to.
[00:37:59] Gerard Donnelly: Okay.
[00:37:59] Gerard Donnelly: Thank
[00:38:00] Gerard Donnelly: And you're right, he knows.
[00:38:02] Gerard Donnelly: Yep.
[00:38:06] Gerard Donnelly: So, testing for him?
[00:38:08] Gerard Donnelly: Yep.
[00:38:10] Gerard Donnelly: Okay.
[00:38:12] Gerard Donnelly: How's Mikaela going?
[00:38:17] Abby Jorgensen: She's, I don't I think she's dealing with some other stressors right now, but had somebody pass away.
[00:38:24] Abby Jorgensen: I also didn't realize she kind of opened up, like, her boyfriend is having custody battles with his kid, so that's been, like, draining on her a little bit.
[00:38:36] Abby Jorgensen: So, I think she's still going to do that race, what is it, Wonka, why don't you say that?
[00:38:43] Abby Jorgensen: Wonka.
[00:38:44] Abby Jorgensen: But I encourage her just to do the aqua bike, take the stress off of her with her run, because that's really.
[00:38:53] Abby Jorgensen: So, I think that's what she's going to end up doing with that one, just to take some stress off of her.
[00:38:59] Abby Jorgensen: Okay.
[00:39:01] Gerard Donnelly: Yeah, fine.
[00:39:02] Gerard Donnelly: Yeah.
[00:39:11] Gerard Donnelly: It's really important that they just try to, whenever things not going well, just try to turn up each day and just do some, something of the session, even if it's not perfect.
[00:39:28] Gerard Donnelly: Because she's, you know, she trained three times last week, which is not brilliant.
[00:39:34] Gerard Donnelly: Yeah.
[00:39:36] Gerard Donnelly: She's missed the swim yesterday.
[00:39:38] Abby Jorgensen: On whatever day, there was a day she, at work, she got like dizzy and sick, those two days.
[00:39:46] Abby Jorgensen: Right, okay.
[00:39:48] Abby Jorgensen: So, yeah, they didn't know what was wrong with her, but then she felt fine after that.
[00:39:52] Abby Jorgensen: She, she said she was scared to go to the doctor because if they tell her she has vertigo, she can't fly.
[00:39:59] Gerard Donnelly: Okay, yeah.
[00:40:00] Gerard Donnelly: So it's kind of a touchy, like, thing.
[00:40:04] Gerard Donnelly: Oh, you wouldn't want to fly anyway with your together?
[00:40:06] Abby Jorgensen: I can barely fly without flying.
[00:40:10] Abby Jorgensen: Give me some pills or whatever.
[00:40:15] Gerard Donnelly: Well, you keep monitoring her.
[00:40:18] Gerard Donnelly: Yeah, she just wanted to, like, get some of the fun.
[00:40:21] Abby Jorgensen: I was like, I think you put too much stress on yourself signing up for all these races because you were so gung-ho right after the first race.
[00:40:28] Gerard Donnelly: So, yeah, yeah, it's good advice.
[00:40:58] Abby Jorgensen: I can't hear you.
[00:40:59] Abby Jorgensen: Are you talking?
[00:41:02] Abby Jorgensen: No.
[00:41:19] Abby Jorgensen: Oh, there we go.
[00:41:22] Gerard Donnelly: Can you hear me?
[00:41:23] Gerard Donnelly: Yeah, now I can.
[00:41:25] Abby Jorgensen: I don't know what happened there.
[00:41:28] Gerard Donnelly: I was just saying, is Challenge Wanaka a 70.3?
[00:41:33] Abby Jorgensen: Yes.
[00:41:34] Gerard Donnelly: All right, okay.
[00:41:36] Gerard Donnelly: Yeah.
[00:41:39] Gerard Donnelly: That's a big one.
[00:41:40] Abby Jorgensen: I was like, let's just, like, use it as, like, her swim has been progressing, and now with the new bike, I was like, let's just use it as a, you know, a good, let's just kind of see where you're at, practice the new bike, and then no stress about anything else.
[00:41:55] Abby Jorgensen: So, I agree with that.
[00:41:57] Abby Jorgensen: Yeah.
[00:41:58] Gerard Donnelly: Yep.
[00:42:00] Gerard Donnelly: Good.
[00:42:01] Gerard Donnelly: Blair?
[00:42:04] Abby Jorgensen: He tested last week.
[00:42:06] Abby Jorgensen: His bike, funny enough, he got his best FTP after all that time away for the holidays.
[00:42:15] Abby Jorgensen: Are kidding?
[00:42:16] Abby Jorgensen: No.
[00:42:17] Abby Jorgensen: I was like, I told him where to start.
[00:42:19] Abby Jorgensen: He started conservative and then, yeah.
[00:42:23] Abby Jorgensen: After I looked at it, was like, wait a second.
[00:42:25] Abby Jorgensen: You just had the best.
[00:42:28] Abby Jorgensen: What did you say?
[00:42:30] Abby Jorgensen: He was amazed by it as well.
[00:42:32] Abby Jorgensen: He didn't know, understand why it happened.
[00:42:34] Abby Jorgensen: But I was like, I don't know, maybe all the rest.
[00:42:36] Abby Jorgensen: I don't know.
[00:42:36] Abby Jorgensen: It's hard to tell.
[00:42:40] Gerard Donnelly: Look, by start, like he did, he did in November 240 and he's really started this time at 234, which is great.
[00:42:52] Gerard Donnelly: I think that's, that's, you know, good coaching.
[00:42:56] Gerard Donnelly: I mean, that's what you should be saying to him.
[00:42:58] Gerard Donnelly: You know, the reason...
[00:43:00] Gerard Donnelly: The reason you've gone so close to what you did last time, sorry, beating what you did last time, is because you started conservatively.
[00:43:12] Gerard Donnelly: That's the answer.
[00:43:14] Gerard Donnelly: Yeah.
[00:43:16] Abby Jorgensen: His treadmill didn't go as well.
[00:43:18] Abby Jorgensen: He tried to run on his 5K on a treadmill because they have ice cold too and it just didn't go as planned.
[00:43:30] Gerard Donnelly: Yeah, okay.
[00:43:32] Abby Jorgensen: But I was like, well, it's a treadmill, so it's hard to gauge, but we'll just take it for what it is right now and just get to training.
[00:43:40] Abby Jorgensen: His swim was just normal, like his normal swim.
[00:43:44] Gerard Donnelly: Well, the treadmill runs not registered on his spreadsheet.
[00:43:52] Gerard Donnelly: Okay, I'll tell Marv.
[00:43:53] Abby Jorgensen: He might not have if it says treadmill.
[00:43:56] Abby Jorgensen: Yeah.
[00:43:56] Abby Jorgensen: I'll tell Marv.
[00:43:59] Abby Jorgensen: Oh.
[00:44:00] Abby Jorgensen: Yeah, he just said after the first 2K, just something felt wrong.
[00:44:05] Abby Jorgensen: Yeah.
[00:44:05] Abby Jorgensen: And.
[00:44:07] Abby Jorgensen: It was too hard at each.
[00:44:11] Gerard Donnelly: Three minute K pace.
[00:44:12] Gerard Donnelly: That's just not.
[00:44:13] Gerard Donnelly: Yeah, which I don't know if that can't be right because that's what he.
[00:44:17] Abby Jorgensen: Yeah.
[00:44:18] Abby Jorgensen: He told me where he started.
[00:44:20] Abby Jorgensen: So his watch or whatever was probably reading wrong too there.
[00:44:23] Abby Jorgensen: Yeah.
[00:44:24] Abby Jorgensen: He started at 427.
[00:44:27] Abby Jorgensen: Right, okay.
[00:44:31] Abby Jorgensen: For the first 2K and then felt horrible, like puking and felt tightness in his right hamstring.
[00:44:36] Abby Jorgensen: Oh, God.
[00:44:39] Gerard Donnelly: Yeah.
[00:44:40] Gerard Donnelly: All right.
[00:44:41] Gerard Donnelly: So.
[00:44:42] Abby Jorgensen: Damn it.
[00:44:44] Abby Jorgensen: Yeah.
[00:44:48] Abby Jorgensen: But he's ready just to get to work because he knows.
[00:44:51] Abby Jorgensen: Yeah.
[00:44:55] Abby Jorgensen: I mean, he has a ways, but again, it'll catch up before we know it.
[00:45:03] Gerard Donnelly: Yeah, Peverden.
[00:45:07] Gerard Donnelly: We're good there.
[00:45:08] Abby Jorgensen: think everything's just pretty normal with her.
[00:45:12] Abby Jorgensen: I just switched around to swim today because their pool's closed because Atlanta area got ice.
[00:45:20] Abby Jorgensen: Yeah, that's a funny comment, isn't it?
[00:45:27] Gerard Donnelly: I didn't want to do all those zone two.
[00:45:32] Abby Jorgensen: Yeah, I don't blame you.
[00:45:34] Gerard Donnelly: Yeah.
[00:45:36] Gerard Donnelly: That's great.
[00:45:41] Gerard Donnelly: This is her last week, is it?
[00:45:43] Gerard Donnelly: Yeah.
[00:45:45] Abby Jorgensen: She's going well?
[00:45:46] Gerard Donnelly: Yep.
[00:45:47] Abby Jorgensen: We had a conversation today of post-Chattanooga because her wife's trying to get pregnant.
[00:45:55] Abby Jorgensen: And if her wife doesn't get pregnant, then they're going to...
[00:45:58] Abby Jorgensen: She's...
[00:46:00] Abby Jorgensen: She's to be the one that tries to get pregnant.
[00:46:02] Abby Jorgensen: And so she was telling me all this could happen after Chattanooga, but she still wants to train and all this stuff.
[00:46:09] Abby Jorgensen: So we had an in-depth conversation about that.
[00:46:13] Abby Jorgensen: That's really good.
[00:46:14] Abby Jorgensen: You've got two options to get pregnant.
[00:46:16] Gerard Donnelly: That's a real benefit, isn't it?
[00:46:19] Abby Jorgensen: Usually both, like if it's like, you know, a same  like that, it's usually one doesn't want, like obviously doesn't want to carry.
[00:46:25] Abby Jorgensen: That's right.
[00:46:26] Abby Jorgensen: But yeah.
[00:46:28] Gerard Donnelly: If you want, if you want a child, you'll, you'll have to.
[00:46:31] Gerard Donnelly: Yeah.
[00:46:34] Gerard Donnelly: Well, that's why I have dogs.
[00:46:37] Abby Jorgensen: Are you happy with, happy with where she's going?
[00:46:40] Abby Jorgensen: Yeah.
[00:46:40] Abby Jorgensen: Yeah.
[00:46:41] Abby Jorgensen: She's, she's good.
[00:46:42] Abby Jorgensen: She's not as, she keeps joking that she's like, I must be like super needy.
[00:46:46] Abby Jorgensen: And I'm like, nah, not really.
[00:46:48] Abby Jorgensen: Like, I don't, I don't know what you consider needy, but I, I've had worse.
[00:46:53] Abby Jorgensen: No, that's, that's great.
[00:46:55] Gerard Donnelly: Uh, how's that Glenn going?
[00:46:59] Gerard Donnelly: Oh, Glenn's
[00:47:00] Gerard Donnelly: So he did a 5K.
[00:47:02] Abby Jorgensen: Yep.
[00:47:04] Abby Jorgensen: How'd it go?
[00:47:05] Abby Jorgensen: It went good.
[00:47:06] Abby Jorgensen: Like, that looks like 2001 is the bib time.
[00:47:10] Abby Jorgensen: Yes.
[00:47:11] Gerard Donnelly: That I looked up.
[00:47:13] Abby Jorgensen: His watch will say his 5K was sub 20.
[00:47:17] Abby Jorgensen: So he wants to go off of that.
[00:47:19] Abby Jorgensen: He's claiming that for sure.
[00:47:22] Abby Jorgensen: Yeah, he's claiming that.
[00:47:23] Abby Jorgensen: But yeah, I don't know.
[00:47:26] Abby Jorgensen: I sent the link in the, this link to Marv.
[00:47:31] Gerard Donnelly: Yes.
[00:47:32] Gerard Donnelly: That was a race, was it?
[00:47:33] Gerard Donnelly: Good.
[00:47:34] Gerard Donnelly: Yeah.
[00:47:37] Abby Jorgensen: Oh, to be fair.
[00:47:40] Abby Jorgensen: Yeah.
[00:47:41] Abby Jorgensen: That's what, like, his watch has it that way.
[00:47:43] Abby Jorgensen: But then I'm like, the bib time and then, so I don't know if it was long.
[00:47:49] Abby Jorgensen: He's a long way under.
[00:47:51] Abby Jorgensen: Yeah.
[00:47:51] Gerard Donnelly: The bib time is the real time, but, you know.
[00:47:59] Gerard Donnelly: Yeah.
[00:48:00] Gerard Donnelly: This is what we take.
[00:48:01] Gerard Donnelly: He's right.
[00:48:02] Gerard Donnelly: Every kilometre he's running under, he's running under four-minute K pace.
[00:48:08] Gerard Donnelly: Look, there's not one over four.
[00:48:10] Gerard Donnelly: He did, he paced it just right.
[00:48:13] Gerard Donnelly: Yeah, so he's run 20.04, you know, he's run an extra 190 metres, so he's done well.
[00:48:21] Abby Jorgensen: Yeah.
[00:48:22] Abby Jorgensen: The pace is the thing, Abby.
[00:48:24] Gerard Donnelly: Like, he's run 3.52, you know, and that's well under four-minute K pace.
[00:48:29] Gerard Donnelly: For a 20-minute, was four-minute K pace.
[00:48:31] Gerard Donnelly: Mm-hmm.
[00:48:33] Gerard Donnelly: So that's really good.
[00:48:35] Gerard Donnelly: He did run 19.07 back in May.
[00:48:39] Gerard Donnelly: Yeah, it was, like, off a bike too, wasn't it?
[00:48:43] Abby Jorgensen: There was a 19.57 off a bike.
[00:48:45] Gerard Donnelly: I don't know whether the one above it was either.
[00:48:49] Gerard Donnelly: It didn't say.
[00:48:50] Abby Jorgensen: That's the one we were talking about, me and him together.
[00:48:53] Abby Jorgensen: were talking about something.
[00:48:55] Abby Jorgensen: Yep.
[00:48:55] Abby Jorgensen: Remember.
[00:48:56] Abby Jorgensen: Good.
[00:48:57] Gerard Donnelly: Is he happy with that?
[00:48:58] Gerard Donnelly: Yeah.
[00:48:59] Gerard Donnelly: Yeah.
[00:48:59] Gerard Donnelly: Yeah.
[00:49:00] Abby Jorgensen: So he decided to, he registered for that one, but 70.3 in Hennequin, I don't know, it's a newer city, and it's a new 70.3.
[00:49:18] Abby Jorgensen: Where is it?
[00:49:22] Abby Jorgensen: Somewhere in Indonesia.
[00:49:25] Abby Jorgensen: Indonesia.
[00:49:26] Abby Jorgensen: Yeah, it's like a couple hour drive for him.
[00:49:29] Abby Jorgensen: Yes, okay.
[00:49:30] Abby Jorgensen: Good.
[00:49:31] Abby Jorgensen: Yep, all right.
[00:49:32] Gerard Donnelly: Well, you've got six weeks, he needs to start doing race-ready stuff.
[00:49:36] Abby Jorgensen: Yeah, I have that stuff in, but I have, then he threw in, he has this charity backyard thing this weekend, and I was like, you are not doing more than four to five laps.
[00:49:45] Abby Jorgensen: And he agreed to it, because I was like, you're not, don't be stupid, Glenn.
[00:49:50] Abby Jorgensen: I didn't say that, but he understands the implications of trying to push mentally, because I was like, I know you can mentally.
[00:49:59] Abby Jorgensen: I don't don't know.
[00:49:59] Abby Jorgensen: I know.
[00:49:59] Abby Jorgensen: Thank
[00:50:00] Abby Jorgensen: It would be a disaster for recovery.
[00:50:04] Abby Jorgensen: That's what I told him.
[00:50:05] Abby Jorgensen: I was like, we need to get, you know, into the race ready stuff and we can't be dealing with injuries or anything like that.
[00:50:13] Abby Jorgensen: So, but yeah, we switched some things around because he has to take a boat over to that, wherever that is.
[00:50:21] Abby Jorgensen: So, yeah, other than that, like, he's pretty motivated and feels good.
[00:50:29] Gerard Donnelly: So, okay.
[00:50:32] Gerard Donnelly: Mario?
[00:50:34] Abby Jorgensen: I feel like he's doing, I had a conversation with him, oh, what was that, Friday afternoon?
[00:50:41] Abby Jorgensen: Yeah.
[00:50:44] Abby Jorgensen: He feels like the bike, he felt like the bike finally.
[00:50:49] Abby Jorgensen: That's great.
[00:50:50] Abby Jorgensen: He finally got the erg, he thinks.
[00:50:53] Abby Jorgensen: that's terrific.
[00:50:55] Abby Jorgensen: Well done.
[00:50:57] Gerard Donnelly: That's perfect.
[00:50:58] Gerard Donnelly: perfect.
[00:50:58] Gerard Donnelly: Mm-hmm.
[00:50:59] Gerard Donnelly: And.
[00:50:59] Gerard Donnelly: And.
[00:51:00] Abby Jorgensen: then, so he'll be in New York this week.
[00:51:03] Abby Jorgensen: It's testing week, but we'll test when he gets home.
[00:51:07] Gerard Donnelly: Oh, he's going 205.
[00:51:13] Gerard Donnelly: That's great.
[00:51:15] Gerard Donnelly: Yeah.
[00:51:18] Gerard Donnelly: He's going really well.
[00:51:20] Gerard Donnelly: Everything's working properly.
[00:51:22] Gerard Donnelly: Yeah, that's what he finally thinks.
[00:51:24] Abby Jorgensen: figured he hit some button and he was messing around with it.
[00:51:27] Abby Jorgensen: And he's like, well, it must have worked.
[00:51:30] Abby Jorgensen: Because it doesn't feel like it's taken over or anything like that.
[00:51:43] Gerard Donnelly: Good.
[00:51:44] Gerard Donnelly: Really good.
[00:51:45] Abby Jorgensen: Yep.
[00:51:52] Gerard Donnelly: This is new for him because he's just not used to training like this.
[00:51:55] Gerard Donnelly: Yeah.
[00:51:57] Gerard Donnelly: Yeah.
[00:52:00] Abby Jorgensen: Yeah, they got snow down there in New Mexico.
[00:52:02] Abby Jorgensen: That's how crazy it was.
[00:52:03] Abby Jorgensen: It is crazy, isn't it?
[00:52:11] Gerard Donnelly: He just missed that one run, didn't he?
[00:52:14] Abby Jorgensen: And I think the double days are hard for him, but we've been trying just to see if he can fit it in.
[00:52:19] Abby Jorgensen: So I try to put it on a Friday when it's a Friday.
[00:52:24] Abby Jorgensen: Yeah, and even though he's a pretty poor swimmer, isn't he?
[00:52:27] Abby Jorgensen: Yeah.
[00:52:28] Abby Jorgensen: Yeah, he said something clicked the other day when I was talking to him, and everything's feeling a little better, so hopefully.
[00:52:36] Gerard Donnelly: Good.
[00:52:38] Abby Jorgensen: So this week, I know he registered for a Peloton class there in New York, because that's where the headquarters is, which I think would be fun.
[00:52:49] Abby Jorgensen: He says there's a pool right by his hotel, so he's going to check that out tonight, assuming he got there, because I know New York.
[00:52:58] Abby Jorgensen: He had a rearranged flight thing.
[00:53:00] Abby Jorgensen: I that, so.
[00:53:02] Gerard Donnelly: Abby, he needs to run on the treadmill.
[00:53:04] Gerard Donnelly: I'd be.
[00:53:06] Abby Jorgensen: Right there instead of swim?
[00:53:08] Gerard Donnelly: Yeah, I'd be, like, he's going to end up with only one 30-minute run on a 5K for the week.
[00:53:15] Gerard Donnelly: So as much as we wanted to improve his swimming, get him on the treadmill.
[00:53:21] Abby Jorgensen: Okay.
[00:53:23] Gerard Donnelly: Yeah, you can, you know, give him a variation of a treadmill run, you know, 10-minute warm-up.
[00:53:30] Gerard Donnelly: You know, the stuff you've been doing to yourself.
[00:53:32] Gerard Donnelly: Okay.
[00:53:33] Gerard Donnelly: You know, two minutes at this mile pace, one minute easy, sort of times five or whatever, and then pull down.
[00:53:44] Gerard Donnelly: So, yeah, get him to do something.
[00:53:48] Gerard Donnelly: Okay.
[00:53:48] Gerard Donnelly: If you can swim as well, great, but the run is more important.
[00:53:54] Gerard Donnelly: Okay.
[00:53:55] Gerard Donnelly: Just for that continuity, because he wouldn't really be running until Friday.
[00:54:07] Abby Jorgensen: Yeah, think it cleared up in that night and he got outside, but in the morning, he was like, I don't know if I'll be able to get outside.
[00:54:15] Gerard Donnelly: Yeah, brilliant.
[00:54:18] Gerard Donnelly: So you just need to not have, every week running is so important.
[00:54:22] Gerard Donnelly: doesn't have to be hard, just because you have to.
[00:54:24] Gerard Donnelly: Yeah.
[00:54:27] Gerard Donnelly: Okay.
[00:54:29] Gerard Donnelly: Philippe?
[00:54:31] Abby Jorgensen: He's on recovery week, testing week, so he just messaged me that third pool is closed until the third for broken.
[00:54:41] Abby Jorgensen: Yes.
[00:54:44] Abby Jorgensen: Is he going all right?
[00:54:48] Abby Jorgensen: Do what?
[00:54:49] Abby Jorgensen: Is he going okay?
[00:54:51] Abby Jorgensen: Yeah, yep.
[00:54:54] Abby Jorgensen: Besides, I think some of the weekend ski stuff is catching up to him, but we decided that we were going to swim.
[00:55:00] Abby Jorgensen: On Monday, instead of Ride, but then, of course, the pool closed, so.
[00:55:08] Abby Jorgensen: Yep.
[00:55:09] Abby Jorgensen: It's a little bit of recovery.
[00:55:11] Abby Jorgensen: Well, last weekend, they couldn't go skiing because it was so cold, so we were able to spread out a little bit of stuff for them.
[00:55:18] Gerard Donnelly: That's good.
[00:55:20] Gerard Donnelly: So.
[00:55:20] Gerard Donnelly: Yep.
[00:55:22] Gerard Donnelly: Well, we're just going to get through this January period with this weather.
[00:55:26] Abby Jorgensen: Crazy.
[00:55:27] Abby Jorgensen: It's always.
[00:55:28] Abby Jorgensen: Always.
[00:55:30] Abby Jorgensen: I'm happy with how she's been going, even with travel.
[00:55:36] Abby Jorgensen: She's back.
[00:55:37] Abby Jorgensen: Yeah.
[00:55:38] Gerard Donnelly: Back into routine.
[00:55:40] Gerard Donnelly: Oh, it's good.
[00:55:42] Gerard Donnelly: She's hitting the targets way above.
[00:55:47] Abby Jorgensen: Yeah.
[00:55:47] Abby Jorgensen: I gave her a reduced intensity, but just in case.
[00:55:52] Gerard Donnelly: So that's terrific.
[00:55:55] Gerard Donnelly: Yep.
[00:55:57] Abby Jorgensen: All right.
[00:55:57] Gerard Donnelly: Anything to.
[00:56:00] Gerard Donnelly: Report about her?
[00:56:01] Abby Jorgensen: No, nothing.
[00:56:02] Abby Jorgensen: Then we just got to get through this travel.
[00:56:03] Abby Jorgensen: She said after this week, she shouldn't have to go anywhere crazy.
[00:56:09] Abby Jorgensen: Yep.
[00:56:10] Gerard Donnelly: She's in Abu Dhabi.
[00:56:11] Gerard Donnelly: She's just.
[00:56:12] Gerard Donnelly: Yeah, I know.
[00:56:13] Abby Jorgensen: I don't even know.
[00:56:15] Abby Jorgensen: It's so hard.
[00:56:18] Abby Jorgensen: Well, they got, Philly got, she got out of there before.
[00:56:21] Abby Jorgensen: She was all worried about, because they got, Philly got dumped on as well, like up to, they were supposed to get 20 inches of snow or something like that.
[00:56:29] Gerard Donnelly: Well, she's in the stream now.
[00:56:31] Gerard Donnelly: She's in 40 degrees, which is 105.
[00:56:33] Gerard Donnelly: Yeah.
[00:56:35] Abby Jorgensen: We won't want to go home.
[00:56:38] Gerard Donnelly: How did Riley go with his testing?
[00:56:41] Abby Jorgensen: Good.
[00:56:42] Abby Jorgensen: A six-watt improvement on his FTP.
[00:56:45] Abby Jorgensen: Jesus, Abby, well done.
[00:56:47] Gerard Donnelly: Like, he's gone from 169 to 240.
[00:56:52] Gerard Donnelly: So 162 to 230.
[00:56:55] Gerard Donnelly: That's amazing.
[00:56:57] Abby Jorgensen: Yeah, and then swim, I think the swim was.
[00:57:00] Abby Jorgensen: was like the same, exactly, or like one second or something.
[00:57:05] Abby Jorgensen: He did 1840 in December.
[00:57:16] Gerard Donnelly: That's good.
[00:57:17] Gerard Donnelly: Good files.
[00:57:19] Gerard Donnelly: Yeah, he was like, that one was hard.
[00:57:26] Gerard Donnelly: Do we run test him or is he still?
[00:57:29] Abby Jorgensen: No, because we were going to do the half marathon, and then remember we were like, he just doesn't have the volume.
[00:57:36] Abby Jorgensen: We didn't want to put him under that volume.
[00:57:38] Abby Jorgensen: Plus, it was, he had to do it on a treadmill anyway with their weather.
[00:57:45] Abby Jorgensen: But I gave him, that's his session.
[00:57:48] Abby Jorgensen: If you look at his session, that's a treadmill session I used, I made for him.
[00:57:52] Abby Jorgensen: Okay, that one, yeah, great.
[00:57:55] Abby Jorgensen: I'm not kidding.
[00:57:56] Abby Jorgensen: You used that one.
[00:57:57] Gerard Donnelly: Yeah.
[00:57:59] Abby Jorgensen: Gave him.
[00:58:00] Abby Jorgensen: Some hills and some different things in it.
[00:58:04] Abby Jorgensen: Enjoy that?
[00:58:06] Abby Jorgensen: Yeah, he said it went faster than he thought.
[00:58:11] Abby Jorgensen: Yep.
[00:58:12] Gerard Donnelly: He seems like a good guy to coach.
[00:58:15] Abby Jorgensen: Yeah, he's fun.
[00:58:16] Abby Jorgensen: Like, something clicked with him today, and he did something in a swim today, too.
[00:58:20] Abby Jorgensen: And then he sent me the video that he watched, and yeah.
[00:58:26] Abby Jorgensen: Has he got a race coming?
[00:58:29] Gerard Donnelly: Ironman, Texas.
[00:58:30] Abby Jorgensen: Oh, God.
[00:58:31] Gerard Donnelly: I asked you that last week, too.
[00:58:33] Abby Jorgensen: Yeah.
[00:58:36] Abby Jorgensen: Yeah, we'll start some, assuming the weather starts to clear up some race-ready stuff.
[00:58:42] Abby Jorgensen: We did find out that there is a velodrome there.
[00:58:46] Abby Jorgensen: Yeah?
[00:58:47] Abby Jorgensen: Okay.
[00:58:47] Abby Jorgensen: It doesn't open until, it's under repairs until February.
[00:58:51] Abby Jorgensen: Where's he?
[00:58:52] Abby Jorgensen: Where's Rowling?
[00:58:53] Abby Jorgensen: Like the Woodlands in Texas.
[00:58:55] Abby Jorgensen: Oh, in Texas, yeah, okay.
[00:58:57] Gerard Donnelly: Oh, yeah.
[00:58:58] Gerard Donnelly: Yeah.
[00:58:58] Abby Jorgensen: But they got a little bit of an eye
[00:59:00] Abby Jorgensen: Nice.
[00:59:01] Abby Jorgensen: Yeah.
[00:59:06] Gerard Donnelly: Well, it'd be great if you can get him out.
[00:59:09] Gerard Donnelly: Don't let him do this indoor.
[00:59:12] Gerard Donnelly: If he's going to do indoor, give him a different session, okay?
[00:59:16] Gerard Donnelly: Like a, just like a mix of endurance?
[00:59:20] Gerard Donnelly: Yeah, but make it, you know.
[00:59:23] Gerard Donnelly: How long?
[00:59:24] Gerard Donnelly: Is he on any of the apps?
[00:59:26] Gerard Donnelly: Yeah, he's on Swift.
[00:59:28] Abby Jorgensen: He's on Swift.
[00:59:29] Gerard Donnelly: So get him on one of those long, you know, 80-mile Swift events.
[00:59:37] Gerard Donnelly: If he wanted to join Ruby, then he could, I'm sure Ironman Texas is on Ruby.
[00:59:42] Gerard Donnelly: You would think.
[00:59:45] Gerard Donnelly: But Ironman Texas is pancake flat.
[00:59:48] Abby Jorgensen: Yeah, it is.
[00:59:49] Abby Jorgensen: It's no good.
[00:59:50] Gerard Donnelly: We want variations, just like the treadmill run we want.
[00:59:55] Gerard Donnelly: So, you know, there's a, talk to him about this.
[00:59:57] Gerard Donnelly: You could do a warm-up.
[01:00:00] Gerard Donnelly: For 10 or 15 minutes, then you could do the TrainingPeak session we give you, then cool down, and then go and do an event with Zwift for 30 miles.
[01:00:08] Gerard Donnelly: You know, just go and find an event.
[01:00:10] Gerard Donnelly: And that'll get you four hours on the bike.
[01:00:13] Gerard Donnelly: Okay?
[01:00:14] Gerard Donnelly: You're trying to create just stimulus.
[01:00:21] Gerard Donnelly: If we just gave him those three by one hour on the inside, I couldn't do it.
[01:00:26] Gerard Donnelly: Neither could you.
[01:00:28] Gerard Donnelly: But we can do that outside, no problem, because there's scenery and variation in the terrain and wind.
[01:00:39] Gerard Donnelly: So explain that to him.
[01:00:42] Gerard Donnelly: From this point on, with your race-ready stuff, the sessions we're giving you are for outside.
[01:00:49] Gerard Donnelly: If it's not possible to ride outside, we make that call on a Friday or whatever, and have the option.
[01:00:59] Abby Jorgensen: Yeah.
[01:01:00] Gerard Donnelly: Okay.
[01:01:02] Gerard Donnelly: Anything else on Riley?
[01:01:04] Gerard Donnelly: No.
[01:01:07] Gerard Donnelly: So Peter stopped.
[01:01:11] Gerard Donnelly: Has he stopped paying?
[01:01:13] Gerard Donnelly: I don't think so.
[01:01:14] Gerard Donnelly: Did Jordan?
[01:01:15] Abby Jorgensen: I think Jordan messaged him back.
[01:01:19] Abby Jorgensen: I had a conversation with Peter this weekend, though, just to close things out and just to keep him motivated to keep doing something.
[01:01:30] Abby Jorgensen: So sounds like he has some job options available, so he's hoping to jump back on when he can.
[01:01:39] Abby Jorgensen: But I had a good conversation with him.
[01:01:41] Gerard Donnelly: You give him another program anyway?
[01:01:44] Gerard Donnelly: Yeah, I had that already in, so I didn't.
[01:01:48] Gerard Donnelly: Do want me to take it out or just?
[01:01:50] Abby Jorgensen: No, no.
[01:01:51] Abby Jorgensen: Definitely.
[01:01:53] Gerard Donnelly: Just you've got to point out that, you know, if he's not paying, still, this is what we do.
[01:01:58] Gerard Donnelly: We'll help you out for a week or two.
[01:02:00] Gerard Donnelly: Yeah.
[01:02:01] Abby Jorgensen: Yeah, I kind of, like, just kind of walked him through when I talked to him of, you know, what he should be doing until he comes back because I don't want him to completely fall off.
[01:02:11] Abby Jorgensen: Yeah.
[01:02:12] Gerard Donnelly: Has he got an event soon?
[01:02:15] Abby Jorgensen: That 70.3 in Hawaii, the one he wants.
[01:02:18] Abby Jorgensen: Yes.
[01:02:19] Abby Jorgensen: May something, I think.
[01:02:21] Abby Jorgensen: Yeah, okay.
[01:02:22] Abby Jorgensen: Yeah, the one he wants to qualify for Kona in.
[01:02:24] Abby Jorgensen: Yes, that's right.
[01:02:27] Abby Jorgensen: So, he's pretty, like, him and his, like, it must be his ex-wife that they share custody with the kid.
[01:02:36] Abby Jorgensen: That's why he moved to North Carolina.
[01:02:38] Abby Jorgensen: They bought, he said they just put an offer in, like, a big, big house with, like, a guest house that they can, like, share.
[01:02:47] Abby Jorgensen: And I guess it went through.
[01:02:48] Abby Jorgensen: So, he seems to be in a good place mentally now.
[01:02:52] Abby Jorgensen: It's a bit of a weird setup.
[01:02:55] Abby Jorgensen: Yeah, I mean, he's, like, it has a whole area where I can use.
[01:02:58] Abby Jorgensen: he's, like, whole mean,
[01:03:00] Abby Jorgensen: For my, like, training area, and it has, the property comes with a hot tub and a sauna, and I was like, all right.
[01:03:08] Abby Jorgensen: great.
[01:03:09] Abby Jorgensen: Fantastic.
[01:03:10] Abby Jorgensen: I'll take that.
[01:03:12] Abby Jorgensen: All right.
[01:03:13] Abby Jorgensen: Dan?
[01:03:16] Gerard Donnelly: Dan, he's good.
[01:03:17] Abby Jorgensen: I'll just move some things around for him because of weather as well, but he did the run on Thursday.
[01:03:27] Abby Jorgensen: He did really well.
[01:03:29] Abby Jorgensen: He's weird.
[01:03:29] Abby Jorgensen: I feel like he's like, when his run is bad, his bike is good.
[01:03:33] Abby Jorgensen: When his bike is bad, his run is good.
[01:03:36] Gerard Donnelly: And running before is kind of throws you off a bit too, you know?
[01:03:42] Abby Jorgensen: Yeah.
[01:03:42] Abby Jorgensen: He just, with the weather, it just worked out better.
[01:03:46] Gerard Donnelly: But you have, that would be a reason you would say to him, hey, you know, it's going to affect you 20 minutes.
[01:03:52] Gerard Donnelly: He's run well, 40, 38.
[01:03:54] Gerard Donnelly: Yeah.
[01:03:57] Gerard Donnelly: What's he done?
[01:03:57] Gerard Donnelly: And it's almost.
[01:04:00] Abby Jorgensen: It was the best one.
[01:04:01] Abby Jorgensen: I think it was a few seconds off.
[01:04:04] Abby Jorgensen: Yeah.
[01:04:04] Gerard Donnelly: One in July did 40-51.
[01:04:06] Gerard Donnelly: That seems faster.
[01:04:09] Gerard Donnelly: Is that right?
[01:04:10] Gerard Donnelly: 40.
[01:04:13] Gerard Donnelly: It's a PB, is it?
[01:04:17] Gerard Donnelly: 40-51.
[01:04:19] Abby Jorgensen: And he did 40-38.
[01:04:21] Gerard Donnelly: He did 40-38.
[01:04:23] Abby Jorgensen: Oh, yeah.
[01:04:27] Abby Jorgensen: What was...
[01:04:28] Abby Jorgensen: It's the one we missed.
[01:04:30] Gerard Donnelly: Somewhere.
[01:04:32] Abby Jorgensen: Maybe not.
[01:04:34] Abby Jorgensen: That's pretty good.
[01:04:36] Gerard Donnelly: Yeah.
[01:04:37] Abby Jorgensen: He was really happy with that.
[01:04:44] Gerard Donnelly: How do you go in the swim?
[01:04:52] Abby Jorgensen: About normal.
[01:04:53] Abby Jorgensen: mean...
[01:04:55] Gerard Donnelly: Yep.
[01:04:56] Gerard Donnelly: 20-50.
[01:04:57] Gerard Donnelly: Yep.
[01:04:58] Gerard Donnelly: That's identical.
[01:05:03] Gerard Donnelly: What did you say?
[01:05:12] Gerard Donnelly: Dropouts.
[01:05:15] Abby Jorgensen: He started where I told him to at like 275, 280.
[01:05:19] Abby Jorgensen: Yep.
[01:05:21] Abby Jorgensen: And then he just kind of, I mean, it wasn't terrible execution.
[01:05:26] Abby Jorgensen: It's not like he dropped like completely off, but I don't know.
[01:05:31] Abby Jorgensen: Like, yeah, I guess if the run affected him or.
[01:05:33] Abby Jorgensen: Yeah.
[01:05:34] Abby Jorgensen: Yeah.
[01:05:35] Gerard Donnelly: But last time in December, he started at 290.
[01:05:39] Gerard Donnelly: Yeah.
[01:05:39] Abby Jorgensen: That's why I was like, give yourself a chance.
[01:05:43] Abby Jorgensen: Yeah.
[01:05:44] Abby Jorgensen: I still think maybe the, when he did that first test with his new bike and power meter, I don't know if.
[01:05:53] Gerard Donnelly: I don't know.
[01:05:55] Abby Jorgensen: I don't know.
[01:05:55] Abby Jorgensen: Right.
[01:05:56] Abby Jorgensen: Yeah.
[01:05:57] Gerard Donnelly: Something was wrong with that one.
[01:05:59] Abby Jorgensen: Yeah.
[01:05:59] Abby Jorgensen: Yeah.
[01:06:00] Abby Jorgensen: Yeah, so maybe, because I was like, I just feel like you're like 282 to 280, what is it, 288 for this one?
[01:06:08] Abby Jorgensen: Yeah.
[01:06:10] Abby Jorgensen: So I don't.
[01:06:13] Abby Jorgensen: So he's actually improved, have he?
[01:06:15] Abby Jorgensen: Yeah, he's improved, but compared to like the 302 one.
[01:06:19] Abby Jorgensen: Yeah.
[01:06:20] Abby Jorgensen: When he first got the bike.
[01:06:21] Abby Jorgensen: So I wonder if there's something off with that one.
[01:06:24] Gerard Donnelly: I think you need to mention that to him.
[01:06:26] Gerard Donnelly: Let's stop comparing it to that.
[01:06:28] Gerard Donnelly: Yeah.
[01:06:32] Gerard Donnelly: He's definitely pushed himself.
[01:06:34] Gerard Donnelly: This is the problem with indoor, where if you're outdoor, you can get the real, you know, it could be, he didn't calibrate his new power meter properly on that first one.
[01:06:49] Gerard Donnelly: Mm-hmm.
[01:06:50] Abby Jorgensen: Could be as simple as that.
[01:06:51] Abby Jorgensen: Or maybe it was like positioning was different and got it.
[01:06:55] Abby Jorgensen: Yeah, I don't know.
[01:06:56] Gerard Donnelly: Has he had a bike fit with his new bike?
[01:06:59] Gerard Donnelly: Yeah, he said he
[01:07:00] Abby Jorgensen: He so, but I know he always says he likes to ride outside more than indoors, or like, he feels better outside.
[01:07:09] Abby Jorgensen: Yeah, well, it's great to see.
[01:07:11] Abby Jorgensen: Yeah, I mean, I do too, but.
[01:07:13] Abby Jorgensen: Yeah, where does he live?
[01:07:15] Gerard Donnelly: Is he living in cold climate?
[01:07:17] Abby Jorgensen: No, he lives in Texas as well, but the last few weeks, obviously.
[01:07:21] Abby Jorgensen: Yeah.
[01:07:23] Gerard Donnelly: I think for him, is he doing Texas race?
[01:07:27] Gerard Donnelly: No, he's, yeah, well, he's doing.
[01:07:29] Abby Jorgensen: 3.3, yeah.
[01:07:31] Abby Jorgensen: 70.3.
[01:07:32] Gerard Donnelly: I think the next test is outside for him.
[01:07:36] Gerard Donnelly: Don't do it inside.
[01:07:37] Abby Jorgensen: Okay.
[01:07:43] Gerard Donnelly: He did a 60-minuter in November.
[01:07:49] Gerard Donnelly: At 268, so, was that after he got, that was before he got the new bike?
[01:07:54] Abby Jorgensen: Yeah, he got the new bike and.
[01:07:55] Abby Jorgensen: Yep.
[01:07:57] Abby Jorgensen: After Thanksgiving.
[01:07:58] Abby Jorgensen: Thanksgiving.
[01:08:00] Abby Jorgensen: Yep.
[01:08:02] Gerard Donnelly: Yep.
[01:08:02] Gerard Donnelly: Okay.
[01:08:05] Gerard Donnelly: Anything else on Dan?
[01:08:07] Gerard Donnelly: Nope.
[01:08:09] Gerard Donnelly: Jane?
[01:08:10] Gerard Donnelly: I dread opening it.
[01:08:12] Gerard Donnelly: Oh, my goodness.
[01:08:13] Abby Jorgensen: No, yeah, we've made some progress.
[01:08:15] Abby Jorgensen: You're a legend.
[01:08:21] Abby Jorgensen: I even had a video call with her because we were trying to figure out her Wahoo.
[01:08:26] Abby Jorgensen: And then we figured out that whoever gave her the Wahoo did not give her a power cord.
[01:08:33] Abby Jorgensen: There's got no – she can't plug it in?
[01:08:35] Abby Jorgensen: Yeah, because she can't plug it in.
[01:08:37] Abby Jorgensen: So she ordered a power cord off of Amazon.
[01:08:42] Abby Jorgensen: It's supposed to be Wednesday or their Wednesday.
[01:08:48] Gerard Donnelly: You can't make up her excuses, can you?
[01:08:51] Gerard Donnelly: No.
[01:08:51] Abby Jorgensen: I mean, I witnessed it because I was on a video call with her.
[01:08:56] Abby Jorgensen: It's like the boy who cried wolf, isn't it?
[01:08:58] Abby Jorgensen: You just don't believe anymore.
[01:09:00] Gerard Donnelly: You know, but that's good.
[01:09:02] Abby Jorgensen: You've got it doing something.
[01:09:04] Abby Jorgensen: That's amazing.
[01:09:05] Abby Jorgensen: Yeah.
[01:09:06] Abby Jorgensen: So she has this week off from work or has something, but yeah, we'll see if she gets in.
[01:09:13] Abby Jorgensen: She said she could swim Tuesday, Friday, so we'll see if that happens.
[01:09:18] Gerard Donnelly: I would, when someone's like her, I would be not doing two swims, Abby.
[01:09:23] Gerard Donnelly: I would be just doing one swim and getting her riding and running every other day.
[01:09:27] Gerard Donnelly: Okay.
[01:09:28] Gerard Donnelly: So scrap that other swim.
[01:09:30] Gerard Donnelly: Okay.
[01:09:32] Gerard Donnelly: Give her a little pre-FTP test there.
[01:09:35] Gerard Donnelly: Okay.
[01:09:36] Abby Jorgensen: Hopefully everything comes tomorrow or whatever.
[01:09:39] Gerard Donnelly: Because you imagine she would line up for that FTP test without having ever ridden the kicker with the power and the power cord.
[01:09:49] Gerard Donnelly: So she needs to actually do another ride.
[01:09:52] Gerard Donnelly: So give her a ride on a Friday so that she's done a ride on the kicker and everything works because you just don't want to see her again.
[01:10:00] Gerard Donnelly: First rider on Saturday, right?
[01:10:02] Gerard Donnelly: Okay.
[01:10:03] Gerard Donnelly: Yep.
[01:10:05] Abby Jorgensen: Bill's testing.
[01:10:06] Gerard Donnelly: How's he going?
[01:10:08] Gerard Donnelly: He tests.
[01:10:09] Abby Jorgensen: Well, he tested FTP and then we moved everything else because of weather and everything else.
[01:10:15] Abby Jorgensen: But he got better.
[01:10:20] Abby Jorgensen: What happened?
[01:10:21] Abby Jorgensen: Five watts, maybe?
[01:10:23] Abby Jorgensen: Five watts better on the FTP?
[01:10:24] Abby Jorgensen: 298 last time.
[01:10:27] Gerard Donnelly: Yeah, 303, I believe.
[01:10:30] Abby Jorgensen: Oh, he cracked 300.
[01:10:39] Abby Jorgensen: That was before our time.
[01:10:42] Abby Jorgensen: 2022.
[01:10:43] Abby Jorgensen: Okay.
[01:10:44] Abby Jorgensen: She's getting back up there.
[01:10:47] Gerard Donnelly: Good.
[01:10:50] Gerard Donnelly: That's terrific.
[01:10:55] Gerard Donnelly: Did he run?
[01:10:58] Gerard Donnelly: No, we're going to run this next week.
[01:11:06] Gerard Donnelly: He's a 50-minute 10K runner last time.
[01:11:12] Abby Jorgensen: Is he in okay form?
[01:11:15] Gerard Donnelly: Yeah, he's been running pretty good.
[01:11:16] Abby Jorgensen: He feels, he's felt the best he has in a while on the run.
[01:11:20] Abby Jorgensen: Yep.
[01:11:24] Gerard Donnelly: Good.
[01:11:25] Gerard Donnelly: Okay.
[01:11:26] Gerard Donnelly: Anything else on him?
[01:11:27] Gerard Donnelly: Nope.
[01:11:28] Gerard Donnelly: We're good with him.
[01:11:31] Abby Jorgensen: Uh, Albert?
[01:11:34] Gerard Donnelly: Albert just keeps checking the boxes.
[01:11:37] Abby Jorgensen: He's doing good.
[01:11:38] Abby Jorgensen: Um, yeah.
[01:11:48] Gerard Donnelly: And did he test recently?
[01:11:51] Abby Jorgensen: Yeah, last, or the week before.
[01:11:53] Abby Jorgensen: Yep.
[01:11:53] Abby Jorgensen: You do all right?
[01:11:54] Gerard Donnelly: 206.
[01:11:56] Gerard Donnelly: That's a big jump.
[01:11:57] Gerard Donnelly: 15-1.
[01:11:58] Abby Jorgensen: Let's go.
[01:11:59] Abby Jorgensen: He
[01:12:00] Gerard Donnelly: Are you happy?
[01:12:01] Abby Jorgensen: Yeah, because in his run he had, I think he had a 5K PB inside his 10K, I believe.
[01:12:10] Gerard Donnelly: Where's his run?
[01:12:11] Gerard Donnelly: Where am I?
[01:12:12] Gerard Donnelly: There he is.
[01:12:13] Abby Jorgensen: Yeah.
[01:12:15] Gerard Donnelly: Fantastic.
[01:12:18] Gerard Donnelly: So he did 30-42 last time for his 5K.
[01:12:25] Gerard Donnelly: That's great.
[01:12:26] Gerard Donnelly: He'd be over the moon, wouldn't he?
[01:12:28] Gerard Donnelly: Yeah.
[01:12:30] Gerard Donnelly: That's good.
[01:12:31] Gerard Donnelly: Well done.
[01:12:33] Gerard Donnelly: Happy days.
[01:12:35] Gerard Donnelly: Really good.
[01:12:36] Abby Jorgensen: Yeah.
[01:12:37] Abby Jorgensen: Everybody's doing pretty good.
[01:12:39] Abby Jorgensen: Yep.
[01:12:42] Abby Jorgensen: Karen, she had a little, she went somewhere hiking this past weekend, so, and had her brother in town, and then work.
[01:12:53] Abby Jorgensen: Her work's pretty intensive, but she always messages me, so then at least she's communicating.
[01:13:00] Abby Jorgensen: Yeah, she's missed a few runs.
[01:13:02] Gerard Donnelly: Yeah.
[01:13:06] Gerard Donnelly: It's good testing.
[01:13:10] Gerard Donnelly: So she's only really had one block of training, hasn't she?
[01:13:13] Gerard Donnelly: Yeah.
[01:13:15] Gerard Donnelly: So keep her expectations low as well.
[01:13:20] Abby Jorgensen: Yeah.
[01:13:25] Gerard Donnelly: Yeah, okay.
[01:13:27] Gerard Donnelly: That's good.
[01:13:28] Gerard Donnelly: Scott?
[01:13:30] Gerard Donnelly: Was a bit sick, was he?
[01:13:31] Abby Jorgensen: Yeah, he was sick last week, but he's gotten back on track with everything.
[01:13:40] Abby Jorgensen: Yep.
[01:13:44] Gerard Donnelly: So that's great.
[01:13:45] Gerard Donnelly: He was the one I was always worried about with – his comments are really good.
[01:13:50] Gerard Donnelly: Yeah.
[01:13:51] Gerard Donnelly: He really explains.
[01:13:53] Abby Jorgensen: Yeah.
[01:13:56] Abby Jorgensen: Yeah, I'd be curious what his next FTP is, because Yeah.
[01:14:00] Abby Jorgensen: I think he's a part of the Rangers, isn't he?
[01:14:02] Abby Jorgensen: Yeah.
[01:14:06] Gerard Donnelly: What did he do last time?
[01:14:10] Abby Jorgensen: Scotty Boy.
[01:14:11] Abby Jorgensen: Like 150-something, maybe?
[01:14:14] Abby Jorgensen: 167?
[01:14:15] Abby Jorgensen: 167, yeah.
[01:14:22] Gerard Donnelly: So we've been giving him one hard session, haven't we?
[01:14:27] Abby Jorgensen: I try to give him...
[01:14:30] Abby Jorgensen: I gave him a 30-30, I thought, at one point.
[01:14:34] Abby Jorgensen: Or maybe he was sick and so I moved it.
[01:14:36] Abby Jorgensen: Yeah.
[01:14:37] Gerard Donnelly: That's probably what happened.
[01:14:39] Abby Jorgensen: Yeah.
[01:14:41] Abby Jorgensen: Or, yeah, there.
[01:14:43] Abby Jorgensen: Yeah.
[01:14:43] Abby Jorgensen: Yeah.
[01:14:45] Gerard Donnelly: Yeah, and just keep his expectations low, too.
[01:14:47] Gerard Donnelly: I think that is the answer all the time, really.
[01:14:55] Gerard Donnelly: There you go, 30-30 this week.
[01:14:57] Gerard Donnelly: Good.
[01:14:57] Gerard Donnelly: Yeah.
[01:14:58] Gerard Donnelly: And then...
[01:15:00] Abby Jorgensen: Yeah, going hiking, so I didn't want to, like, double up anything those days, so.
[01:15:09] Gerard Donnelly: Okay, and the new guy, Jimmy.
[01:15:13] Abby Jorgensen: He's good.
[01:15:14] Abby Jorgensen: He's going to be fun to work with.
[01:15:16] Abby Jorgensen: He's, let's see here, gave him 500 meters today.
[01:15:21] Abby Jorgensen: Yep.
[01:15:26] Abby Jorgensen: He, he has the bike, he has, he got, he got some power pedals with it, the garment rallies, and then he was going to look for the cheapest Wahoo Kicker that he can find online, probably, probably Amazon.
[01:15:45] Abby Jorgensen: He'll order that tomorrow.
[01:15:48] Abby Jorgensen: Yep.
[01:15:49] Gerard Donnelly: So he's, he's using the gym bike at the moment, isn't he?
[01:15:52] Abby Jorgensen: Yeah, I mean, it has, it has Watts on it, which is helpful, just to kind of see what he, what he's doing.
[01:15:59] Abby Jorgensen: But yeah.
[01:16:00] Abby Jorgensen: Yeah, he did that on Sunday.
[01:16:02] Abby Jorgensen: If you scroll up, I had him.
[01:16:04] Abby Jorgensen: Yeah.
[01:16:06] Abby Jorgensen: Yeah.
[01:16:07] Abby Jorgensen: On there.
[01:16:08] Abby Jorgensen: it's, I mean.
[01:16:11] Gerard Donnelly: Yep.
[01:16:14] Gerard Donnelly: And that's using the Peloton.
[01:16:17] Abby Jorgensen: Yeah.
[01:16:20] Gerard Donnelly: Yeah, it turns 5K off as well.
[01:16:25] Gerard Donnelly: It's auto lapping every 5K.
[01:16:29] Gerard Donnelly: I mean, think it's on the, on the bike computer.
[01:16:33] Abby Jorgensen: He says it Bluetooth to the gym bike or whatever.
[01:16:37] Abby Jorgensen: So I don't know.
[01:16:39] Gerard Donnelly: That's a setting he can change on his own bike computer.
[01:16:42] Gerard Donnelly: bike or his own.
[01:16:44] Abby Jorgensen: Yep.
[01:16:45] Abby Jorgensen: Did he buy the, because he didn't have a bike computer either.
[01:16:48] Abby Jorgensen: Yeah.
[01:16:49] Abby Jorgensen: I don't, I don't know.
[01:16:50] Abby Jorgensen: He just went into a store today.
[01:16:51] Abby Jorgensen: He said and bought a whole bunch of stuff.
[01:16:53] Abby Jorgensen: Yeah.
[01:16:58] Gerard Donnelly: Yeah.
[01:16:58] Gerard Donnelly: Just check he's got the bike.
[01:17:05] Gerard Donnelly: He should have no trouble with the run, but we, even though he's a really good runner, we don't want to drop his running.
[01:17:11] Gerard Donnelly: Yeah.
[01:17:15] Gerard Donnelly: Good.
[01:17:16] Gerard Donnelly: So once he gets his kicker, then we can test him.
[01:17:19] Gerard Donnelly: Yep.
[01:17:20] Abby Jorgensen: Yep.
[01:17:22] Gerard Donnelly: Yeah, so you're doing a really good job with everybody who starts, but Jordan and I are really going to, we're trying to emphasise to all the coaches, we're getting new people, but we're losing.
[01:17:39] Gerard Donnelly: We've got this churn.
[01:17:42] Gerard Donnelly: So every time we get a new person, someone drops off.
[01:17:46] Gerard Donnelly: So you're not actually, we're not actually going up.
[01:17:50] Gerard Donnelly: So you're doing a great job.
[01:17:53] Gerard Donnelly: This is no criticism, but we've just got to find a way to really get them to trust the process for an extension.
[01:18:00] Gerard Donnelly: Rather than having someone on for 12 weeks or 16 weeks is really not economical for us.
[01:18:07] Gerard Donnelly: spend a lot, you're spending a lot of time teaching them and then they leave after three months.
[01:18:14] Gerard Donnelly: So a guy like James, you know, and Scott, you do this well, but just remind you to make sure that you spend more time with them early on until they get your trust.
[01:18:28] Gerard Donnelly: And then, and then you can, you know, do the normal coaching, but, but really be on top of Jimmy this, you know, these two weeks, reaching out to him a lot, checking how he's going and same as Scott, because Scott was the one who was saying, I needed feedback that coach last time didn't give me, you know, but don't hear me saying this as I'm criticizing you or not, that you're doing, you're doing really well.
[01:18:52] Gerard Donnelly: But I just, I'm, I'm trying to think of ways that we can get their trust so that they're going to stay on.
[01:18:59] Gerard Donnelly: We know this is.
[01:19:00] Gerard Donnelly: Great program for them, but I don't know why it's just this continual revolving door.
[01:19:08] Gerard Donnelly: We get them and we lose them and then we get someone new.
[01:19:11] Gerard Donnelly: So, you know what I'm saying?
[01:19:14] Abby Jorgensen: Yeah.
[01:19:15] Abby Jorgensen: No.
[01:19:16] Abby Jorgensen: Same thing that happens at gyms too.
[01:19:18] Abby Jorgensen: Yeah.
[01:19:19] Abby Jorgensen: Yeah.
[01:19:20] Gerard Donnelly: Yeah.
[01:19:21] Gerard Donnelly: It's trying to figure out.
[01:19:22] Abby Jorgensen: I mean, yeah, the people that trust you, like, they'll be the lifers.
[01:19:27] Abby Jorgensen: Exactly.
[01:19:28] Abby Jorgensen: Yeah.
[01:19:29] Abby Jorgensen: Yep.
[01:19:30] Gerard Donnelly: So I think a lot of it's in the first month of if they're feeling valued, welcomed, care factor.
[01:19:41] Gerard Donnelly: I think if that gets established, then it's really hard for them to not want to keep going.
[01:19:52] Gerard Donnelly: But, you know, you deal with people in your gym industry.
[01:19:56] Gerard Donnelly: So that's why you're good at this.
[01:19:58] Gerard Donnelly: You know.
[01:20:00] Gerard Donnelly: You're a born coach, but you've just got to make sure that, you know, and I know you're doing your best, but we've just got to try and stop this churn rate.
[01:20:13] Gerard Donnelly: We can't have people joining and people leaving at the same time.
[01:20:18] Gerard Donnelly: Otherwise, we just stay at the same level all the time.
[01:20:22] Gerard Donnelly: You know, we've got room to grow, but during the Christmas period, there haven't been any more applications.
[01:20:29] Gerard Donnelly: So we need to get on top of that and start doing some more podcasts.
[01:20:35] Gerard Donnelly: So that seems to be the catalyst for more applications.
[01:20:39] Gerard Donnelly: So we're doing one today.
[01:20:45] Abby Jorgensen: Does it happen a lot over there too with, like, is there certain seasons in Australia that you see it off?
[01:20:53] Abby Jorgensen: Yeah.
[01:20:53] Gerard Donnelly: Yeah, the winter, winter, June, July here, we don't get hardly any applications.
[01:21:00] Gerard Donnelly: But in the States, it's definitely December, January.
[01:21:06] Gerard Donnelly: It's the last thing they're thinking about.
[01:21:09] Gerard Donnelly: Because the summer's so far away.
[01:21:12] Gerard Donnelly: They start to think more about it in February, March, when, oh, God, the races are coming.
[01:21:20] Gerard Donnelly: Whereas most of the applications we get are September, October, November, because the summer season's coming December, January, February.
[01:21:30] Gerard Donnelly: Yeah.
[01:21:32] Gerard Donnelly: Anyway, the high correlation is the more podcasts we do, the more applicants we get.
[01:21:37] Gerard Donnelly: And we've had a bit of a slow period during the last four weeks.
[01:21:43] Gerard Donnelly: But time to pick it up.
[01:21:48] Gerard Donnelly: Are you all good with everything else?
[01:21:49] Gerard Donnelly: Yep.
[01:21:52] Gerard Donnelly: Good job, Abby.
[01:21:53] Gerard Donnelly: Thank you.
[01:21:54] Gerard Donnelly: Yeah.
[01:21:55] Abby Jorgensen: Just let me know, yeah, if there's anything else I can do better, obviously.
[01:21:59] Abby Jorgensen: Yeah.
[01:21:59] Abby Jorgensen: Yeah.
[01:22:00] Abby Jorgensen: No, no.
[01:22:01] Gerard Donnelly: The key is that you communicate and that you're reading all their comments and you're answering any of their questions and that they're improving.
[01:22:09] Gerard Donnelly: And once they improve, they'll enjoy it.
[01:22:12] Gerard Donnelly: Every time I get feedback about they're doing well, you know, and you've had a whole lot of testing happening where they're all doing well.
[01:22:20] Gerard Donnelly: So, and you can make that a better experience, obviously, during the people who are going to test this week, and you've already had a lot of tests last week.
[01:22:29] Gerard Donnelly: But the people who going to test this week, you make sure that they're clear about their race plan.
[01:22:33] Gerard Donnelly: And it is a race plan.
[01:22:35] Gerard Donnelly: It's a strategy.
[01:22:37] Gerard Donnelly: And I find if I let people just, if I don't communicate with them before they've tested, they inevitably screw it up.
[01:22:46] Gerard Donnelly: Whereas if we go in with the plan, and I know it's a little bit more work, but, you know, I don't want them to be spoon fed by me.
[01:22:55] Gerard Donnelly: I'll say to them, hey, Abby, what's your plan tomorrow?
[01:22:58] Gerard Donnelly: Or what's your plan for Thursday?
[01:23:01] Gerard Donnelly: And they have to come back to me with, oh, I actually haven't thought about it.
[01:23:06] Gerard Donnelly: Well, you know, that's your first problem.
[01:23:09] Gerard Donnelly: Or if they come back to you with, you know, and you've looked at their data and they did 200 watts last time and they've come back to you with, oh, I think I might start at, you know, 205 and see and really push on, see if I can.
[01:23:19] Gerard Donnelly: And you'll go, oh, no, I don't think, you know, I don't think that's a good idea.
[01:23:23] Gerard Donnelly: You know, you've not trained that well during this period, Christmas period.
[01:23:27] Gerard Donnelly: So be more conservative.
[01:23:28] Gerard Donnelly: Or you've trained the house down, that's really good, but still start at 198 or 196.
[01:23:34] Gerard Donnelly: So let them tell you first and then give them advice.
[01:23:40] Gerard Donnelly: So the question's always going to be, hey, Abby, what's your plan for, you know, Saturday's 5K?
[01:23:46] Gerard Donnelly: What's your plan for Thursday's 20 minute?
[01:23:50] Gerard Donnelly: And wait for them to respond.
[01:23:55] Gerard Donnelly: And then you can have a good discussion.
[01:23:57] Abby Jorgensen: Yep.
[01:23:58] Abby Jorgensen: plan for?
[01:24:00] Gerard Donnelly: And that way you will ensure that you've both had a real crack at planning this.
[01:24:05] Gerard Donnelly: And if it doesn't go well, then, you know, you've done everything you can.
[01:24:10] Gerard Donnelly: It could be just on the day.
[01:24:14] Gerard Donnelly: Okay.
[01:24:15] Abby Jorgensen: Yep.
[01:24:16] Gerard Donnelly: Terrific.
[01:24:17] Gerard Donnelly: And, yeah, hang in there with the weather.
[01:24:22] Gerard Donnelly: We're trying.
[01:24:23] Abby Jorgensen: We're almost used to it by now, right?
[01:24:25] Abby Jorgensen: Yeah.
[01:24:27] Abby Jorgensen: All right.
[01:24:28] Gerard Donnelly: Good stuff.
[01:24:29] Gerard Donnelly: All right.
[01:24:30] Gerard Donnelly: Yep.
[01:24:30] Gerard Donnelly: All right.
[01:24:30] Abby Jorgensen: you.
[01:24:32] Abby Jorgensen: Thank you.
