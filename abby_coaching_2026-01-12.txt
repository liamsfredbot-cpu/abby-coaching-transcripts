## Transcript

[00:00:00] Gerard Donnelly: Oh, I'd be happy with that.
[00:00:02] Abby Jorgensen: Yeah, I wish it was that way yesterday.
[00:00:05] Abby Jorgensen: Yes.
[00:00:06] Gerard Donnelly: Well done.
[00:00:07] Abby Jorgensen: Yeah, thanks.
[00:00:10] Gerard Donnelly: It would have been freezing, was it?
[00:00:13] Gerard Donnelly: Yeah, it was not.
[00:00:15] Abby Jorgensen: I mean, you kind of warm up, but like there's still like my hands are in my gloves, so cold.
[00:00:22] Abby Jorgensen: Like your feet never really warm up.
[00:00:25] Abby Jorgensen: The guy that he was like, I don't think my feet warmed up till like mile four.
[00:00:30] Abby Jorgensen: Yeah.
[00:00:31] Abby Jorgensen: Did you run with a beanie, with a beanie on?
[00:00:34] Gerard Donnelly: Yeah, I ran with my stocking cap on.
[00:00:36] Gerard Donnelly: Yeah.
[00:00:37] Gerard Donnelly: Yep.
[00:00:38] Gerard Donnelly: With a cap or with a beanie?
[00:00:41] Gerard Donnelly: Just like the TriVelo cap.
[00:00:43] Abby Jorgensen: Yeah, yep, yep, yep.
[00:00:45] Gerard Donnelly: I don't know, sometimes you can always take it off.
[00:00:48] Gerard Donnelly: I reckon a beanie might be, because you lose heat through your hands, your head, and your feet.
[00:00:54] Gerard Donnelly: Yeah.
[00:00:56] Gerard Donnelly: So when you warmed up on the trainer at home, that would have been.
[00:00:59] Gerard Donnelly: Great, but did you do any running before the race?
[00:01:04] Gerard Donnelly: I mean, a little bit, but it was more like just trying to stay warm and go and get registered and then did a couple of slides.
[00:01:12] Gerard Donnelly: Yeah, that's right.
[00:01:14] Gerard Donnelly: Okay.
[00:01:16] Gerard Donnelly: Yeah, it's really hard because it's not normal to run in those temperatures.
[00:01:20] Gerard Donnelly: So the more warmed up you are, the better off you're going to be, obviously.
[00:01:26] Gerard Donnelly: But, yeah, I think, Abby, was great that you did it.
[00:01:35] Gerard Donnelly: And the time doesn't really matter.
[00:01:38] Gerard Donnelly: It's more about, you know, having competition and being pushed and having to work out how to measure your effort.
[00:01:47] Abby Jorgensen: Yeah, there was a, I mean, now that you look at the elevation too, like the first, whatever, three miles, the first half of it, 5K was like, I felt like, I think my heart rate even stayed like in the 150s and I was just cruising on.
[00:02:00] Abby Jorgensen: Along, the second place guy was just like right behind me the whole way so I could hear his footsteps.
[00:02:06] Gerard Donnelly: Yes.
[00:02:07] Abby Jorgensen: And he told me afterwards, he's like, I just used you to pace off of the first half of it or whatever.
[00:02:13] Abby Jorgensen: So we just kind of stayed together.
[00:02:15] Abby Jorgensen: Yeah.
[00:02:16] Gerard Donnelly: And then he sprints.
[00:02:18] Abby Jorgensen: Yeah, the hills kind of, I mean, on the way back, it just like immediately you could feel the elevation.
[00:02:25] Gerard Donnelly: Yeah.
[00:02:26] Gerard Donnelly: So.
[00:02:29] Gerard Donnelly: That's a lot of trust, someone putting.
[00:02:32] Gerard Donnelly: In me.
[00:02:34] Gerard Donnelly: Pacing in someone else.
[00:02:35] Gerard Donnelly: Don't you reckon?
[00:02:37] Gerard Donnelly: Anyway.
[00:02:38] Gerard Donnelly: I mean, I I felt great.
[00:02:40] Abby Jorgensen: I like, especially during the, like, there's like that little flat part.
[00:02:44] Abby Jorgensen: I just felt like, I don't know what I was going.
[00:02:46] Abby Jorgensen: felt like I was going, I think my watch said 720 pace, I mean, 730, 720.
[00:02:54] Gerard Donnelly: Yeah.
[00:02:56] Gerard Donnelly: It comes up, it's really weird how it comes up in kilometers there and miles there.
[00:02:59] Gerard Donnelly: up, comes
[00:03:00] Gerard Donnelly: That's probably for my watch, yeah, because it laps every mile.
[00:03:04] Gerard Donnelly: Yeah, 4.30 is good.
[00:03:08] Gerard Donnelly: 4.30, where do we work out?
[00:03:13] Gerard Donnelly: 4.30, 7, 6, 8, so it's really good.
[00:03:21] Abby Jorgensen: Yeah, maybe even from two to four kilometres, that's where I kind of felt like I was just kind of cruising along.
[00:03:33] Gerard Donnelly: Your heart rate was really steady, wasn't it?
[00:03:35] Gerard Donnelly: Yeah.
[00:03:36] Abby Jorgensen: I mean, it started to jump towards that end, but...
[00:03:39] Gerard Donnelly: Yeah, so it should.
[00:03:42] Gerard Donnelly: Yeah.
[00:03:43] Gerard Donnelly: Good.
[00:03:47] Gerard Donnelly: Top of the podium for the females.
[00:03:51] Gerard Donnelly: There wasn't a lot of people, but still.
[00:03:54] Gerard Donnelly: No, no, that's great.
[00:03:58] Gerard Donnelly: Was it well organised?
[00:04:00] Gerard Donnelly: Yeah, it wasn't too bad.
[00:04:01] Abby Jorgensen: There was also like a 5K and then a half marathon as well.
[00:04:05] Abby Jorgensen: Oh, there's a half, right.
[00:04:06] Gerard Donnelly: Okay.
[00:04:07] Abby Jorgensen: Yeah, so it's like for a while I was like behind the 140 pacer, which I was like, I'm going faster than the 140 pacer.
[00:04:16] Abby Jorgensen: And then I passed him and then for a while I was with like the 130 pacer, but I was like, that should be faster than what I'm going.
[00:04:23] Abby Jorgensen: So it was, I don't know what they were doing.
[00:04:27] Abby Jorgensen: They had nobody with them.
[00:04:28] Abby Jorgensen: So I think they were just running.
[00:04:30] Abby Jorgensen: By themselves at that point.
[00:04:32] Gerard Donnelly: How many people were in the half marathon?
[00:04:35] Gerard Donnelly: I couldn't, I don't know.
[00:04:36] Abby Jorgensen: I didn't look.
[00:04:37] Abby Jorgensen: It didn't seem like there was that many.
[00:04:40] Abby Jorgensen: But I knew a few people like doing it.
[00:04:43] Abby Jorgensen: I saw a few people with a different bib beforehand, but.
[00:04:46] Abby Jorgensen: Good.
[00:04:48] Gerard Donnelly: Well done for finding it.
[00:04:51] Gerard Donnelly: Keep your eyes open for some more.
[00:04:54] Abby Jorgensen: Yeah, there seems to be random ones.
[00:04:56] Abby Jorgensen: Yeah, yeah.
[00:04:58] Gerard Donnelly: You'd be happy with your.
[00:05:00] Gerard Donnelly: FTP test, was really good.
[00:05:02] Abby Jorgensen: Yeah, was happy with the one watt improvement or whatever it was.
[00:05:06] Abby Jorgensen: Great execution, Abby.
[00:05:07] Gerard Donnelly: And look, if you think you've got a little bit more left, start earlier.
[00:05:13] Abby Jorgensen: At that point, I didn't think I did, actually.
[00:05:16] Gerard Donnelly: That's okay.
[00:05:17] Gerard Donnelly: I'm always interested.
[00:05:19] Abby Jorgensen: Yeah, two minutes, I was like, okay, two minutes go up.
[00:05:22] Abby Jorgensen: And then at two minutes, I was like, nope.
[00:05:24] Gerard Donnelly: At 90 seconds, I was like, nope.
[00:05:26] Gerard Donnelly: Okay.
[00:05:27] Gerard Donnelly: And remember, you don't have to go from zero to hero.
[00:05:30] Gerard Donnelly: Like, you're pushing 220s, and then, you know, you're pushing 280s at the end.
[00:05:35] Gerard Donnelly: So, you know, you can always just push up to 230s if you want to.
[00:05:39] Gerard Donnelly: And then don't finish at 280, but finish at 235, 240.
[00:05:44] Gerard Donnelly: Don't think, you know, I would rather you just did this than, yeah.
[00:05:52] Gerard Donnelly: Yeah, so anyway, just take that mentality out of, you know, I've just got it all out.
[00:05:57] Gerard Donnelly: Just try to kind of lift.
[00:06:00] Gerard Donnelly: Four or five watts or six watts, that's actually better than trying to go 50 watts higher.
[00:06:05] Gerard Donnelly: What was your last 10 seconds is like 267, 270.
[00:06:18] Gerard Donnelly: And when you're averaging 194, that's like 80 watts higher.
[00:06:24] Gerard Donnelly: So, you know, if you started earlier to be at 210, 215, then you're going to get three, more watts ahead rather than waiting for 90 seconds.
[00:06:37] Gerard Donnelly: It's just really minor stuff, Abby.
[00:06:39] Gerard Donnelly: It's just not that important.
[00:06:42] Gerard Donnelly: All we want to do is get you used to executing again under pressure.
[00:06:49] Gerard Donnelly: So I think you did a really good job considering, you know, you're basically riding one hard ride a week with an endurance ride.
[00:06:55] Gerard Donnelly: So, and hopefully it's just getting your fitness up.
[00:07:00] Gerard Donnelly: How's your fatigue?
[00:07:01] Gerard Donnelly: I mean, it was fine.
[00:07:04] Abby Jorgensen: I mean, it's fine now.
[00:07:05] Abby Jorgensen: I mean, at the beginning of the week, I definitely knew I was ready for, like, the load.
[00:07:11] Abby Jorgensen: But, yeah, by the middle of week, like, whatever first run I did or even Thursday's run, I was like, well, this felt really easy.
[00:07:21] Abby Jorgensen: Yeah, good.
[00:07:22] Abby Jorgensen: Yeah, but that's the purpose, isn't it?
[00:07:23] Gerard Donnelly: Just to absorb the load.
[00:07:27] Gerard Donnelly: And, you we're not back.
[00:07:28] Gerard Donnelly: What did we do?
[00:07:29] Gerard Donnelly: 49, sorry, 41K running.
[00:07:35] Gerard Donnelly: And, you know, that's coming down from a 70K week.
[00:07:37] Gerard Donnelly: So, you know, we've been gradually building 67.
[00:07:42] Gerard Donnelly: It's really good, 64, 67, 70.
[00:07:45] Gerard Donnelly: And now we need to come back up again to the 70 plus.
[00:07:50] Gerard Donnelly: So, as you see, I've just moved it around a little bit.
[00:07:54] Gerard Donnelly: I'm just worried that I'm worried about this session after a 10K.
[00:07:58] Gerard Donnelly: So, if...
[00:07:59] Gerard Donnelly: if...
[00:07:59] Gerard Donnelly: if...
[00:08:00] Gerard Donnelly: we had this session next week, it wouldn't worry me at all, but you've just run 10K, and then I'm sort of making you run half marathon pace for that.
[00:08:08] Gerard Donnelly: So, Abby, if you run outside tomorrow, would that be – would you be inside?
[00:08:16] Abby Jorgensen: Yeah, I usually do it early in the morning because I'll go to the – yeah, tomorrow's a weird day.
[00:08:22] Gerard Donnelly: So, you know, I've been trying to – I don't know if you saw those.
[00:08:28] Gerard Donnelly: That's nice.
[00:08:30] Gerard Donnelly: Yeah, so I've got this chart that I've – oh, he can't see it, hang on.
[00:08:34] Abby Jorgensen: That's right.
[00:08:35] Abby Jorgensen: Yeah, I have several I've looked at too.
[00:08:37] Abby Jorgensen: I just – some of them are different, so it's hard to – Yeah.
[00:08:41] Gerard Donnelly: Race chart.
[00:08:44] Gerard Donnelly: So all I'm doing is trying to work out what you're doing for those efforts.
[00:08:52] Gerard Donnelly: So 4.46 to 4.58.
[00:08:54] Gerard Donnelly: So really all I'm doing is going in, finding 4.46, which is – got I've tried As I
[00:09:00] Gerard Donnelly: 7.40 pace to 4.58, which is 8-minute mile pace.
[00:09:06] Gerard Donnelly: So set the treadmill speed, sorry, sorry, sorry, sorry, you know what mean, 7-minute mile, 4.58, what is that in terms of kilometres?
[00:09:18] Gerard Donnelly: So speed and then miles.
[00:09:22] Gerard Donnelly: Same, so set the treadmill to that speed if you can.
[00:09:26] Gerard Donnelly: Yeah, okay, I mean, not the 0.2s or whatever, but it just goes up by 0.1s.
[00:09:33] Gerard Donnelly: Yes, so I think that's the best way for anybody, I think, doing… That's what I've been trying to do, similar to that.
[00:09:43] Gerard Donnelly: well, you're ahead of me, so it's something that's frustrated me.
[00:09:48] Abby Jorgensen: I even have a chart that, like, depending on the incline, it tells you what, like, pace it would correspond to outside as well.
[00:09:55] Gerard Donnelly: Send me that one.
[00:09:57] Gerard Donnelly: I really want to nail it.
[00:09:58] Gerard Donnelly: I've got so many people.
[00:10:00] Gerard Donnelly: Northern Hemisphere training on a treadmill.
[00:10:01] Gerard Donnelly: I just didn't know whether they're training properly.
[00:10:06] Gerard Donnelly: Yeah, and it's hard.
[00:10:07] Abby Jorgensen: And I feel like the watch is more accurate the faster you go.
[00:10:12] Abby Jorgensen: And it probably just depends on people's cadence, too.
[00:10:16] Abby Jorgensen: But since I'm a faster cadence runner anyway.
[00:10:20] Abby Jorgensen: How does a watch track it on the treadmill?
[00:10:24] Abby Jorgensen: I think it does through my heart rate monitor because of the...
[00:10:30] Abby Jorgensen: Because of all the things it tracks.
[00:10:31] Abby Jorgensen: Yeah.
[00:10:32] Abby Jorgensen: I think it does like the acceler...
[00:10:34] Abby Jorgensen: Like the oscillations.
[00:10:36] Abby Jorgensen: Yes.
[00:10:37] Gerard Donnelly: Or, yeah, like accelerometer type situation.
[00:10:40] Gerard Donnelly: What type of treadmill are you on at the gym?
[00:10:44] Abby Jorgensen: Nordic track?
[00:10:45] Gerard Donnelly: Right, so it's...
[00:10:46] Gerard Donnelly: Or wait, Proform, actually.
[00:10:50] Abby Jorgensen: Yeah, it's flat, but you can...
[00:10:51] Abby Jorgensen: Yeah, it's not one of the assault runners or anything.
[00:10:55] Abby Jorgensen: We have those at the gym, but...
[00:10:57] Abby Jorgensen: Yeah, but you've got to drive that belt, don't you?
[00:10:59] Gerard Donnelly: it's you.
[00:10:59] Gerard Donnelly: you.
[00:11:00] Abby Jorgensen: Yeah, it doesn't correspond very well to small people because you have to, like, put out more watts to get it to move.
[00:11:08] Abby Jorgensen: Yeah.
[00:11:09] Gerard Donnelly: Yeah.
[00:11:10] Gerard Donnelly: OK.
[00:11:11] Gerard Donnelly: All right.
[00:11:12] Gerard Donnelly: So what we're trying to do now is get something that's, yeah, around that that's a little bit slower pace, but then we do the quicker one with the fartlek session.
[00:11:30] Gerard Donnelly: OK.
[00:11:30] Gerard Donnelly: So it's kind of important that you don't overdo.
[00:11:36] Gerard Donnelly: So if we're looking at the two minute on, two minute off, we want to make sure that you run on those in that range and then, you know, don't let this drop below.
[00:11:48] Gerard Donnelly: I'm using kilometres, which is not helpful, but just don't let it drop below 525, 530.
[00:11:54] Gerard Donnelly: The idea is, you know, don't run so hard here, run 446 pace.
[00:11:59] Gerard Donnelly: And then.
[00:11:59] Gerard Donnelly: And
[00:12:00] Gerard Donnelly: Make sure you're not going past 520s.
[00:12:03] Gerard Donnelly: So it's quite a hard 20-minute run.
[00:12:06] Gerard Donnelly: So it's pretty much just straight 20 minutes of over, under, over, under.
[00:12:11] Gerard Donnelly: Okay.
[00:12:12] Gerard Donnelly: You can manipulate this, Abby, for your coaching purposes.
[00:12:16] Gerard Donnelly: If you wanted someone to run way faster, you could make it 110% for the hard bit.
[00:12:25] Gerard Donnelly: And then for the easy bit, you can make it 85%.
[00:12:27] Gerard Donnelly: So make it a lot harder and a lot easier.
[00:12:31] Gerard Donnelly: And then you can get closer, sort of, you know, just over your threshold, maybe 102, and just under, maybe 95.
[00:12:38] Gerard Donnelly: So, you know, rather than 92.
[00:12:40] Gerard Donnelly: You can manipulate this however you want.
[00:12:43] Gerard Donnelly: So what we're trying to do is just get people not to run steady state, which is, you know, some different run we do when we do the steady state run.
[00:12:50] Gerard Donnelly: We're trying to run the same pace the whole way.
[00:12:52] Gerard Donnelly: We're trying to get your body used to run a little bit hard, having to recover, but not recover.
[00:12:57] Gerard Donnelly: Just slow down a little bit because it could replicate a
[00:13:00] Gerard Donnelly: Rises and Falls on a 10K or a half marathon course where nothing's pancake flat in this world.
[00:13:08] Gerard Donnelly: So you've got little rises, so you've got to get your body used to changing the pace, whereas we wouldn't do that in a race.
[00:13:17] Gerard Donnelly: We would keep the effort the same, but I want you to practice that in training.
[00:13:23] Abby Jorgensen: Makes sense.
[00:13:24] Abby Jorgensen: You good with that?
[00:13:25] Gerard Donnelly: Yep.
[00:13:26] Abby Jorgensen: I was yesterday, I was trying to, like, I knew, like, after going out and back, I was like, I know what was coming ahead of me, and I was, like, trying to recover on the downhills, because the uphills were jacking my heart right up.
[00:13:40] Gerard Donnelly: Yeah, and you've got to try and control the uphill, not to, you know how on a bike we would try to ride the higher end of the power?
[00:13:47] Gerard Donnelly: Well, on a running course, you don't want to do that.
[00:13:50] Gerard Donnelly: You want to keep your heart rate as steady as you can.
[00:13:52] Gerard Donnelly: So if you're averaging, what were you averaging, 720, 725 mile pace, was it?
[00:13:58] Gerard Donnelly: Something like that.
[00:14:00] Gerard Donnelly: So you would expect to be running up the hill at 740 and keeping your heart rate at, what was it, Abby, you run?
[00:14:08] Abby Jorgensen: I would say the majority of the run it was in the low 160s.
[00:14:13] Gerard Donnelly: Yeah, so you're trying to run 715 pace on the downhill and keeping the heart rate the same and running 740 on the uphill.
[00:14:23] Gerard Donnelly: And so people think they need to attack the hill, but you want to keep it like a time trial.
[00:14:32] Gerard Donnelly: And every time you go up the hill harder, that's great if you want to break away from someone or you need to finish, but if you go up the hill harder, you're going to pay the cost.
[00:14:42] Gerard Donnelly: So it's actually, you know, it's a harder way to run, I think.
[00:14:48] Gerard Donnelly: Yeah.
[00:14:50] Gerard Donnelly: Okay, so this week I wanted to, you know, try to add a little bit more time.
[00:14:59] Gerard Donnelly: more time.
[00:14:59] Gerard Donnelly: Thank
[00:15:00] Gerard Donnelly: You know, jump back to where we were before.
[00:15:03] Gerard Donnelly: So, you know, potentially we want to start to increase this run again back up to an hour.
[00:15:11] Gerard Donnelly: But we've got to be super careful after you do this fast run.
[00:15:15] Gerard Donnelly: So, you know, this is just to get your speed going, just the one run.
[00:15:19] Gerard Donnelly: It's only 20 minutes, so it shouldn't be too taxing.
[00:15:23] Gerard Donnelly: No, we should be fine.
[00:15:26] Abby Jorgensen: Yeah, this weekend I was looking at the 40s.
[00:15:30] Abby Jorgensen: I might have to go, like, half and half for that Sunday run.
[00:15:34] Abby Jorgensen: Okay, yep.
[00:15:35] Abby Jorgensen: This is going to get really cold again.
[00:15:38] Abby Jorgensen: Yeah.
[00:15:39] Gerard Donnelly: You know it.
[00:15:40] Gerard Donnelly: You know it.
[00:15:43] Gerard Donnelly: All right.
[00:15:44] Gerard Donnelly: And you've got that little race going up?
[00:15:47] Gerard Donnelly: Yeah.
[00:15:49] Abby Jorgensen: That's a short and sharp.
[00:15:51] Gerard Donnelly: Yeah.
[00:15:52] Abby Jorgensen: I can always maybe do my long run that day or afterwards.
[00:15:58] Abby Jorgensen: Or you can do your right.
[00:16:00] Gerard Donnelly: Ride after that if you wanted to do your long run.
[00:16:02] Gerard Donnelly: But you're probably better off doing your long run after that.
[00:16:05] Gerard Donnelly: After that, okay.
[00:16:06] Gerard Donnelly: So that, you know, if you just do your ride and run that day, then you're kind of fresh for the triathlon.
[00:16:14] Gerard Donnelly: Okay.
[00:16:15] Gerard Donnelly: Yep.
[00:16:15] Gerard Donnelly: Anything else on you?
[00:16:18] Gerard Donnelly: I don't think so.
[00:16:20] Abby Jorgensen: No.
[00:16:21] Gerard Donnelly: Anything else I need to know?
[00:16:22] Gerard Donnelly: No.
[00:16:22] Abby Jorgensen: I mean, I did my swim today, but it… Oh, sorry.
[00:16:26] Gerard Donnelly: Today's already Monday.
[00:16:27] Gerard Donnelly: Oh, yeah.
[00:16:27] Abby Jorgensen: My watch made me go 1,025, so I'm annoyed.
[00:16:36] Gerard Donnelly: What was your pace?
[00:16:36] Gerard Donnelly: doing that lately, too.
[00:16:38] Gerard Donnelly: I don't know why.
[00:16:39] Gerard Donnelly: It's just… The pace is all that matters.
[00:16:42] Gerard Donnelly: Yeah.
[00:16:42] Abby Jorgensen: I don't know.
[00:16:43] Abby Jorgensen: It felt like I was going the same as every other swim I do, but it's hard to tell.
[00:16:49] Gerard Donnelly: Yeah.
[00:16:50] Gerard Donnelly: So you're banging on two minutes, Kay.
[00:16:53] Gerard Donnelly: Two minutes per hundred.
[00:16:55] Gerard Donnelly: And what was the last test you did?
[00:16:57] Gerard Donnelly: Okay.
[00:16:57] Gerard Donnelly: Okay.
[00:16:58] Gerard Donnelly: Okay.
[00:16:58] Gerard Donnelly: Okay.
[00:17:00] Abby Jorgensen: I can't remember.
[00:17:00] Abby Jorgensen: Yeah, I've got it up here.
[00:17:09] Gerard Donnelly: 155, so a little bit slow, but it just doesn't.
[00:17:15] Abby Jorgensen: I never.
[00:17:17] Gerard Donnelly: I felt good.
[00:17:18] Abby Jorgensen: I mean, my 50s before that were fairly fast, so I was feeling good, but who knows.
[00:17:25] Gerard Donnelly: No issues there.
[00:17:26] Gerard Donnelly: Yeah.
[00:17:27] Abby Jorgensen: Swim is what it is.
[00:17:29] Abby Jorgensen: It is.
[00:17:31] Gerard Donnelly: All right.
[00:17:33] Gerard Donnelly: I've got a message from Mark.
[00:17:37] Abby Jorgensen: Mark, yeah, so he's talked to you.
[00:17:39] Abby Jorgensen: Yeah, because I had messaged him and was just trying to feel out his mental state.
[00:17:47] Abby Jorgensen: Yeah.
[00:17:49] Gerard Donnelly: Fair enough.
[00:17:51] Gerard Donnelly: Yeah, hugs for him.
[00:17:52] Abby Jorgensen: I mean, both of us, but it's hard to.
[00:17:57] Abby Jorgensen: Situations like that are hard, I'm sure.
[00:17:59] Abby Jorgensen: here.
[00:17:59] Abby Jorgensen: Thank
[00:18:00] Abby Jorgensen: Yeah, yeah.
[00:18:01] Gerard Donnelly: He's still got a bit of knee pain, has he?
[00:18:04] Abby Jorgensen: Yeah, he has some knee pain.
[00:18:07] Abby Jorgensen: I suggest that he just still bike if he has the time.
[00:18:10] Abby Jorgensen: And he said he would try to and get through this divorce.
[00:18:14] Gerard Donnelly: Yeah, it's quite debilitating, really.
[00:18:19] Abby Jorgensen: Yeah, I mean, he has kids, too, so I can't imagine.
[00:18:25] Gerard Donnelly: Has this been going on for a while, or is it just something that's...
[00:18:29] Abby Jorgensen: I mean, he just told me about the divorce a couple of weeks ago, so, I mean, I'm assuming it has, because ever since Christmas, it's kind of been hit or miss for him.
[00:18:40] Gerard Donnelly: Yeah.
[00:18:41] Gerard Donnelly: Yes.
[00:18:42] Gerard Donnelly: All right.
[00:18:43] Gerard Donnelly: Coco, everything all right there?
[00:18:47] Abby Jorgensen: Oh, yeah.
[00:18:48] Abby Jorgensen: We kind of have to figure out how she's going to train at this other camp, because it looks like a lot of...
[00:18:55] Abby Jorgensen: Like, she'll be on the bike so much, but I just don't know.
[00:18:59] Gerard Donnelly: I mean...
[00:19:00] Abby Jorgensen: And we've looked at our schedule and I've put in some stuff.
[00:19:04] Abby Jorgensen: And so I just don't know how to navigate that.
[00:19:12] Gerard Donnelly: Yeah, but I think, how did she go in the testing just before we go into that?
[00:19:19] Gerard Donnelly: Not too bad.
[00:19:20] Abby Jorgensen: The 20 minute one I felt was some good data.
[00:19:24] Abby Jorgensen: Her 10K was really good.
[00:19:26] Abby Jorgensen: She said for the 60 miniter, the flat area had tons of tour buses and stuff going that day.
[00:19:35] Abby Jorgensen: So she had to, she went up, she did like a 30 minute hill climb, which I'm like, well, I guess it gives us something for niece.
[00:19:45] Gerard Donnelly: She did it out and back, did she?
[00:19:47] Gerard Donnelly: That's her best 60 miniter.
[00:19:49] Abby Jorgensen: I know there was a hill in there, but.
[00:19:52] Gerard Donnelly: So 20 minutes, she was 2.43.
[00:19:57] Gerard Donnelly: It's not in the spreadsheet.
[00:19:59] Gerard Donnelly: She did
[00:20:02] Gerard Donnelly: It is the outdoor one.
[00:20:03] Abby Jorgensen: I just checked.
[00:20:05] Abby Jorgensen: Where am I looking?
[00:20:08] Gerard Donnelly: Oh, I better get the right person.
[00:20:16] Gerard Donnelly: I'm looking at the wrong person, sorry.
[00:20:18] Gerard Donnelly: Okay.
[00:20:18] Abby Jorgensen: I was like, I checked most of them today earlier.
[00:20:22] Gerard Donnelly: Oh, good.
[00:20:23] Gerard Donnelly: Very good.
[00:20:27] Gerard Donnelly: So 36.4.
[00:20:29] Gerard Donnelly: That's not too bad.
[00:20:32] Gerard Donnelly: And she done many at those, so she did.
[00:20:37] Gerard Donnelly: What was that one?
[00:20:39] Abby Jorgensen: The one at the beginning of this one was 248 with some heavy wind.
[00:20:44] Abby Jorgensen: Yeah, and she only did one direction, wasn't it?
[00:20:47] Gerard Donnelly: Yeah.
[00:20:47] Gerard Donnelly: Yeah, that's why the speed is.
[00:20:49] Gerard Donnelly: she finally.
[00:20:52] Abby Jorgensen: Yeah.
[00:20:53] Gerard Donnelly: That's So, yeah.
[00:20:55] Gerard Donnelly: yeah.
[00:20:58] Gerard Donnelly: yeah.
[00:20:58] Gerard Donnelly: Yeah.
[00:21:02] Gerard Donnelly: So she's hovering around the same, let's see how, you're looking at the same spreadsheets, mean, see how, you know, when you do this one direction thing, you just can't, like, you can't make sense of whether 243 is better than 248, you know?
[00:21:19] Gerard Donnelly: Yeah, that's what I was like, I told her, I was like, it's hard to tell because of your speed, you're going into, if you're going into a heavy headwind, it's going to change a lot of things, tires.
[00:21:30] Gerard Donnelly: Yep, so how did she execute the 60 minute?
[00:21:43] Gerard Donnelly: Did she go out and back, Abby?
[00:21:44] Gerard Donnelly: Did you work out?
[00:21:46] Abby Jorgensen: She kind of did, but then she said she had to avoid, she had to avoid whatever was happening on the main road, so she went out and then came back great thing that down And With
[00:22:00] Abby Jorgensen: And then did Hill.
[00:22:03] Abby Jorgensen: There's some change of direction in there.
[00:22:06] Abby Jorgensen: You can tell by the speed.
[00:22:15] Gerard Donnelly: Yeah.
[00:22:20] Gerard Donnelly: Um.
[00:22:27] Gerard Donnelly: 208.
[00:22:28] Abby Jorgensen: Yeah, her last one was like 180 or something like that, so.
[00:22:32] Abby Jorgensen: Yeah.
[00:22:34] Gerard Donnelly: And, uh, it had 400 meters of elevation.
[00:22:39] Gerard Donnelly: Oh, my goodness.
[00:22:42] Gerard Donnelly: That's, that's a lot.
[00:22:44] Gerard Donnelly: That's lot?
[00:22:46] Gerard Donnelly: Yeah.
[00:22:47] Gerard Donnelly: Yeah.
[00:22:49] Gerard Donnelly: That's like a thousand feet.
[00:22:53] Gerard Donnelly: Okay.
[00:22:56] Gerard Donnelly: Um.
[00:22:58] Gerard Donnelly: Thank you.
[00:22:58] Gerard Donnelly: you.
[00:22:59] Gerard Donnelly: Thank Thank Thank Thank Thank Thank Thank
[00:23:00] Gerard Donnelly: All right.
[00:23:01] Gerard Donnelly: What did do here?
[00:23:04] Gerard Donnelly: I know.
[00:23:05] Abby Jorgensen: That was 150, I think.
[00:23:06] Abby Jorgensen: Yeah.
[00:23:09] Gerard Donnelly: I don't know how I remember that.
[00:23:11] Gerard Donnelly: What was that?
[00:23:12] Abby Jorgensen: I said, I don't know how I remembered that.
[00:23:15] Abby Jorgensen: No, that's pretty impressive.
[00:23:18] Abby Jorgensen: Because I looked at it probably.
[00:23:21] Gerard Donnelly: How did the run go?
[00:23:23] Gerard Donnelly: I mean, good.
[00:23:25] Abby Jorgensen: I mean, 37 minutes or something like that.
[00:23:28] Abby Jorgensen: But-wise, really good.
[00:23:30] Abby Jorgensen: So she hadn't really, I don't think she's done maybe one other 10K with us just because of all of her injuries.
[00:23:42] Abby Jorgensen: Yes.
[00:23:44] Abby Jorgensen: But what is that, like a six-minute mile or something like that?
[00:23:48] Abby Jorgensen: I don't know.
[00:23:49] Abby Jorgensen: Six?
[00:23:50] Gerard Donnelly: 347.
[00:23:50] Gerard Donnelly: So what's that?
[00:23:53] Abby Jorgensen: I guess I could look at mine.
[00:23:55] Gerard Donnelly: I'll look at mine, yeah.
[00:23:56] Gerard Donnelly: It's six or seven.
[00:23:59] Gerard Donnelly: Yeah.
[00:24:02] Gerard Donnelly: It's pretty good.
[00:24:05] Gerard Donnelly: Yeah, so what did she do?
[00:24:13] Gerard Donnelly: 354, 341.
[00:24:14] Gerard Donnelly: That's really good, considering she'd be tired from the day before.
[00:24:16] Gerard Donnelly: So she's done three tests in three days.
[00:24:22] Abby Jorgensen: Yeah, and she, yeah.
[00:24:28] Abby Jorgensen: Yeah.
[00:24:30] Abby Jorgensen: She always, always talks about how our muscles are just always, like, which I never, I don't know if she just builds up lactate so quickly, but, like, it's not necessarily, like, a bad thing.
[00:24:57] Gerard Donnelly: What's Cardio Pum?
[00:24:59] Gerard Donnelly: Is that her?
[00:25:00] Gerard Donnelly: Just like cardiovascular.
[00:25:03] Gerard Donnelly: Yeah.
[00:25:04] Gerard Donnelly: Never heard of it called.
[00:25:05] Gerard Donnelly: Oh, no, I don't.
[00:25:07] Abby Jorgensen: That's the doctor in her, suppose.
[00:25:10] Gerard Donnelly: Great.
[00:25:11] Gerard Donnelly: Oh, that's some good testing.
[00:25:12] Gerard Donnelly: How did she swim?
[00:25:14] Gerard Donnelly: A little slower, but it was non-wetsuit.
[00:25:17] Abby Jorgensen: She said she swam wetsuit first time, non-wetsuit this time.
[00:25:20] Gerard Donnelly: Yeah.
[00:25:21] Gerard Donnelly: Was she in a pool or she had on a...
[00:25:25] Abby Jorgensen: It looked like a pool to me.
[00:25:30] Gerard Donnelly: I'm 43, yes.
[00:25:35] Gerard Donnelly: A little bit slower.
[00:25:36] Gerard Donnelly: Yeah.
[00:25:37] Abby Jorgensen: I mean, I know she's been working on some things and wanted to put those into play, so as long as she's working on things.
[00:25:45] Abby Jorgensen: She swam two 1Ks.
[00:25:47] Gerard Donnelly: She swam so much.
[00:25:51] Abby Jorgensen: I mean, I know it's not a lot on the body, but it still builds up fatigue, especially on the shoulders.
[00:25:57] Abby Jorgensen: Yeah.
[00:26:00] Gerard Donnelly: Well, only 30 seconds rest and she's gone.
[00:26:05] Gerard Donnelly: Geez, I wouldn't know about that, but anyway.
[00:26:18] Gerard Donnelly: Alright, so she flies home and then goes back out.
[00:26:21] Gerard Donnelly: Yeah.
[00:26:26] Abby Jorgensen: So I try to make this week fit in everything because I know when she gets back to Sweden, it'll be cold.
[00:26:35] Abby Jorgensen: So she'll go to indoor session.
[00:26:38] Gerard Donnelly: Abby, what were you thinking after doing the 10K?
[00:26:41] Gerard Donnelly: Did you want to give it a run straight away?
[00:26:44] Gerard Donnelly: It should have been really a ride there.
[00:26:49] Abby Jorgensen: I think I was thinking when I was trying to figure out how to fit everything in with her traveling.
[00:27:00] Gerard Donnelly: Yeah, I would have just given her an easy ride in the swim, which would have been fine.
[00:27:10] Gerard Donnelly: And then, because she's done the 10K, which is going to be hard on her legs, and then just done this ride with a little run off the bike.
[00:27:20] Gerard Donnelly: Anyway, just for future, if someone runs a 10K, don't get them running the next day.
[00:27:25] Abby Jorgensen: Okay.
[00:27:27] Gerard Donnelly: You know, give them a coffee ride.
[00:27:29] Gerard Donnelly: That coffee ride would have been perfect there.
[00:27:32] Gerard Donnelly: But that's fine from now on.
[00:27:33] Gerard Donnelly: She's got through that, but I'd say she'd be pretty, her legs would be pretty stuffed.
[00:27:37] Gerard Donnelly: What'd she say?
[00:27:40] Gerard Donnelly: My legs are over.
[00:27:43] Gerard Donnelly: So, yeah, just be super careful.
[00:27:45] Gerard Donnelly: That's how we injure people.
[00:27:50] Gerard Donnelly: And, yeah, I understand you're trying to fit it in with the travel, which totally makes sense.
[00:27:58] Gerard Donnelly: But, yeah, I think, yeah, I
[00:28:00] Gerard Donnelly: And I think with her camp, there's got to be down periods where you can't be on the bike all day.
[00:28:07] Gerard Donnelly: And what are they doing the rest of the time?
[00:28:09] Gerard Donnelly: That would be the question.
[00:28:10] Gerard Donnelly: What's her role the rest of the day?
[00:28:13] Abby Jorgensen: Yeah, I mean, she says, so if you scroll to the next week, we kind of put in like her responsibilities.
[00:28:20] Abby Jorgensen: Like she's on the bike like one, two, three, four, like five days a week.
[00:28:27] Abby Jorgensen: And they're like long.
[00:28:29] Abby Jorgensen: She says most of them are easy rides, but I'm like, it's still three or four hours on a bike.
[00:28:34] Abby Jorgensen: Yeah.
[00:28:39] Abby Jorgensen: So she just went in and edited some of the stuff, like gave me an idea of what she gave me a schedule, but it's all in Dutch or whatever language.
[00:28:52] Abby Jorgensen: German or German.
[00:28:53] Abby Jorgensen: German, yeah.
[00:28:54] Abby Jorgensen: Yeah.
[00:28:57] Gerard Donnelly: Yep.
[00:28:59] Gerard Donnelly: That's true.
[00:29:00] Gerard Donnelly: Two weeks.
[00:29:10] Gerard Donnelly: There's no swimming at all?
[00:29:11] Gerard Donnelly: It's just a bike camp, is it?
[00:29:13] Gerard Donnelly: No, there's swimming.
[00:29:14] Abby Jorgensen: Like, she says she's allowed to swim one hour anytime during the day that they're not out doing their coaching stuff.
[00:29:24] Abby Jorgensen: Yeah.
[00:29:24] Gerard Donnelly: What do they mean one hour?
[00:29:26] Gerard Donnelly: Like, are they putting a curfew on her swimming time?
[00:29:29] Gerard Donnelly: No.
[00:29:29] Gerard Donnelly: I think that's just when they have available for their swim.
[00:29:32] Abby Jorgensen: I don't know.
[00:29:33] Gerard Donnelly: That's what she told me.
[00:29:35] Gerard Donnelly: Yes.
[00:29:36] Gerard Donnelly: So we want to just try to run every second day.
[00:29:40] Gerard Donnelly: That's actually what we're trying to do.
[00:29:43] Gerard Donnelly: And if she's going to be on the bike for long periods of time, I would just get her to do some easy running.
[00:29:49] Gerard Donnelly: So I don't know.
[00:29:51] Gerard Donnelly: I would sort of need to know.
[00:29:52] Gerard Donnelly: Are they starting at 8 o'clock in the morning or 9 o'clock when they're doing their rides?
[00:29:56] Gerard Donnelly: It's like a time or something.
[00:29:59] Gerard Donnelly: What'd you say then?
[00:29:59] Gerard Donnelly: then?
[00:30:00] Abby Jorgensen: It's like 10.
[00:30:00] Abby Jorgensen: They start at like 10.30 and then go till, you know, 2 or 3.30 in the afternoon.
[00:30:06] Gerard Donnelly: Right.
[00:30:06] Gerard Donnelly: Well, I would be saying to it, on Tuesday, you run at 8 or 7.
[00:30:12] Gerard Donnelly: Where are they?
[00:30:17] Abby Jorgensen: Shoot, I don't know.
[00:30:18] Abby Jorgensen: It's in a different language.
[00:30:23] Gerard Donnelly: I'm just asking about the really...
[00:30:26] Gerard Donnelly: The weather.
[00:30:27] Gerard Donnelly: Weather, yeah.
[00:30:32] Gerard Donnelly: I'm guessing it's warm.
[00:30:34] Gerard Donnelly: Yeah.
[00:30:38] Gerard Donnelly: Is it...
[00:30:39] Gerard Donnelly: I don't know that's the name of the town or is that...
[00:30:44] Gerard Donnelly: Just the name of the camp.
[00:30:48] Gerard Donnelly: Oh, forte means in Spanish, strong, loud, or intense.
[00:30:55] Abby Jorgensen: So it's not a place.
[00:30:57] Gerard Donnelly: Let's see.
[00:30:58] Gerard Donnelly: Let's Thank you.
[00:31:01] Gerard Donnelly: Anyway, I think if she's riding, say, from 10 o'clock in the morning, she's better off running first.
[00:31:07] Gerard Donnelly: That's what I would be doing.
[00:31:08] Gerard Donnelly: Okay.
[00:31:09] Gerard Donnelly: And Abby, I would just say to her, during this camp period, let's just run easy, varying from 30 minutes to an hour every second day, depending on your fatigue.
[00:31:21] Gerard Donnelly: Okay.
[00:31:22] Gerard Donnelly: So, whatever time they have breakfast, say, get her run over before she has breakfast, and then they have breakfast, so I imagine at eight, or I'm just imagining, I'll be running at seven, or, you know, and then having breakfast, and then jumping on the bike.
[00:31:38] Gerard Donnelly: And then that's her done for the day.
[00:31:40] Abby Jorgensen: Okay, so you wouldn't, because she was asking, like, if it's an easy day, do we do any, like, hard intensity on the bike, or do we just, they'll just let her do whatever she's supposed to do on the bike, and leave it as that?
[00:31:53] Gerard Donnelly: I think, I think if you feel, if she feels that the rides are a waste of time, and it's just rolling along, Thank Thank Thank you.
[00:31:59] Gerard Donnelly: Thank
[00:32:01] Gerard Donnelly: I think you have to wait and see.
[00:32:02] Gerard Donnelly: Yeah, that's what we've been talking.
[00:32:05] Gerard Donnelly: It's hard to know until she gets there.
[00:32:07] Gerard Donnelly: Just say to her, know, Gerard wants to see what happens on, you know, what is happening with the intensity.
[00:32:13] Gerard Donnelly: And then you can make decisions about that.
[00:32:15] Gerard Donnelly: If she wants to run in the afternoon, that's great.
[00:32:17] Gerard Donnelly: I'm happy with that.
[00:32:18] Gerard Donnelly: But I'm just trying to make it so that she's on the bike for four hours.
[00:32:22] Gerard Donnelly: You know, the last thing you want to do is, buddy, go for a run.
[00:32:26] Gerard Donnelly: But I'm happy for her to do either.
[00:32:28] Gerard Donnelly: But we need, in her free time, to be running, okay?
[00:32:34] Gerard Donnelly: Okay.
[00:32:35] Abby Jorgensen: Yeah, I know there's some, like, run-off-the-bike sections, too.
[00:32:39] Abby Jorgensen: She said she doesn't always have to do them, but, again, she doesn't know which one she has to do with them and which one she doesn't.
[00:32:46] Gerard Donnelly: Yep, all right.
[00:32:47] Gerard Donnelly: Well, I think you just have to keep communicating with her a bit.
[00:32:53] Gerard Donnelly: And if you feel that there's not enough intensity but she's still tired, then you have to say that.
[00:33:00] Gerard Donnelly: Look, it's pointless as, you know, doing any hard stuff if you're just carrying too much fatigue.
[00:33:06] Gerard Donnelly: It's just, we don't want to run you into the ground.
[00:33:10] Abby Jorgensen: Yeah, if you're averaging, what, 15 hours on the bike a week or whatever it's going to be, it's a lot.
[00:33:18] Gerard Donnelly: You know, the best things you could do is just something really short, like, you know, just revving your legs, 30, 15s, two sets.
[00:33:30] Gerard Donnelly: You know, one set even, just to, you know, we know that if people do endurance and just do one VO2 set each week, they improve.
[00:33:42] Gerard Donnelly: Okay?
[00:33:43] Gerard Donnelly: Okay.
[00:33:48] Gerard Donnelly: All right, so when in doubt, just throw a VO2 set in.
[00:33:52] Gerard Donnelly: Okay.
[00:33:55] Gerard Donnelly: Just once.
[00:33:56] Gerard Donnelly: You wouldn't want to do more than that.
[00:33:59] Gerard Donnelly: Okay.
[00:34:00] Abby Jorgensen: All right, any more on her?
[00:34:03] Gerard Donnelly: No, that was a big thing, just trying to navigate that camp, but I think it's going to come down to, like, day-to-day communication.
[00:34:11] Gerard Donnelly: Yeah, keep me updated on that, Abby.
[00:34:12] Gerard Donnelly: I'm happy to help you with that.
[00:34:14] Gerard Donnelly: Okay.
[00:34:16] Gerard Donnelly: All right, we better fly through the rest.
[00:34:17] Gerard Donnelly: Doogie?
[00:34:19] Gerard Donnelly: I talked to him.
[00:34:21] Abby Jorgensen: We're just trying to get him through high rocks.
[00:34:24] Abby Jorgensen: I told him, I'm like, I need you to at least turn your watch on.
[00:34:28] Abby Jorgensen: He did yesterday, today, I guess it would be.
[00:34:32] Abby Jorgensen: And he's like, put some running in for me, because there's not enough running in the strength class that he does.
[00:34:39] Abby Jorgensen: Yeah.
[00:34:40] Gerard Donnelly: So, let's see.
[00:34:41] Abby Jorgensen: Last week, he was going to do the bike, but he missed the weigh-in or something for those races.
[00:34:46] Gerard Donnelly: Yes.
[00:34:48] Abby Jorgensen: So he couldn't participate or something.
[00:34:50] Gerard Donnelly: I don't understand that.
[00:34:52] Gerard Donnelly: You can just join any race.
[00:34:53] Gerard Donnelly: You don't have to do a weigh-in.
[00:34:54] Gerard Donnelly: I don't know.
[00:34:55] Abby Jorgensen: It's some group that he's a part of.
[00:34:59] Abby Jorgensen: I don't know.
[00:34:59] Abby Jorgensen: Thank
[00:35:00] Gerard Donnelly: Yeah, well, that's a team thing, but so, you know, telling him if you miss that, just do a Zwift Race.
[00:35:06] Gerard Donnelly: Okay.
[00:35:07] Gerard Donnelly: You know, or give him a training session.
[00:35:11] Gerard Donnelly: This is really weird coaching.
[00:35:14] Gerard Donnelly: Yeah.
[00:35:15] Gerard Donnelly: Not really what we want.
[00:35:17] Abby Jorgensen: Yeah.
[00:35:19] Abby Jorgensen: Anyway, just go along.
[00:35:21] Gerard Donnelly: But once he's finished that, we just need to say to him, hey, listen, you know, what else is he doing?
[00:35:27] Abby Jorgensen: He's got some triathlons that he has on his calendar or on his radar.
[00:35:34] Gerard Donnelly: Yeah.
[00:35:34] Gerard Donnelly: Okay.
[00:35:35] Gerard Donnelly: Andrew?
[00:35:38] Abby Jorgensen: He's good.
[00:35:39] Abby Jorgensen: tested last week.
[00:35:43] Abby Jorgensen: Tested really well, I would say.
[00:35:47] Gerard Donnelly: His swim was like one second slower or like one second per hundred slower.
[00:35:55] Abby Jorgensen: FTP was up.
[00:35:58] Abby Jorgensen: Yeah.
[00:35:59] Abby Jorgensen: He, he, he, he, he,
[00:36:00] Gerard Donnelly: You too hard, Abby.
[00:36:01] Gerard Donnelly: Yeah, I talked to him about that.
[00:36:03] Abby Jorgensen: I asked him, was like, did you start at two?
[00:36:06] Abby Jorgensen: He's like, yeah, I know.
[00:36:10] Gerard Donnelly: Yeah, it's frustrating when they keep repeating that.
[00:36:13] Gerard Donnelly: Like, I don't even know.
[00:36:14] Gerard Donnelly: Is he looking what he did last time, 216?
[00:36:16] Gerard Donnelly: Why would you start at 225?
[00:36:19] Abby Jorgensen: We even talked about it.
[00:36:21] Abby Jorgensen: So I don't know if he thought he just felt good and went.
[00:36:24] Abby Jorgensen: But yeah.
[00:36:26] Gerard Donnelly: My problem would be, I don't know if he's looking at his lap power.
[00:36:30] Gerard Donnelly: Like, do you know he was doing 225?
[00:36:33] Gerard Donnelly: You know?
[00:36:34] Gerard Donnelly: Like, you and I would be looking at that first two or three minutes.
[00:36:38] Gerard Donnelly: If we did 216 last test, no way in hell you or I would be writing, looking down, saying 225.
[00:36:45] Gerard Donnelly: Would we?
[00:36:46] Gerard Donnelly: No.
[00:36:48] Gerard Donnelly: So I would ask him, are you looking at lap power?
[00:36:51] Gerard Donnelly: Okay.
[00:36:54] Gerard Donnelly: Because there can't be any other reason.
[00:36:56] Gerard Donnelly: Why would you self-sabotage like that?
[00:37:06] Gerard Donnelly: It's even 229, Abby, for the first 90 seconds, you know, 15 watts above what he did last time.
[00:37:17] Gerard Donnelly: Anyway, all that happens is, it's great that he improved, but he would have got more.
[00:37:25] Gerard Donnelly: He's done himself out of some watts.
[00:37:27] Gerard Donnelly: How did he run?
[00:37:30] Abby Jorgensen: Really well.
[00:37:33] Abby Jorgensen: It's a PB, isn't it?
[00:37:34] Gerard Donnelly: Yeah.
[00:37:37] Abby Jorgensen: How did he execute?
[00:37:38] Gerard Donnelly: Can you remember?
[00:37:39] Gerard Donnelly: I'm looking at it now.
[00:37:40] Gerard Donnelly: 48 series run.
[00:37:43] Abby Jorgensen: Good.
[00:37:45] Gerard Donnelly: It's good.
[00:37:46] Gerard Donnelly: 454 pace, 452 second half.
[00:37:49] Gerard Donnelly: Well done.
[00:37:49] Gerard Donnelly: That's really good.
[00:37:52] Gerard Donnelly: That's good testing, Abby.
[00:37:53] Gerard Donnelly: Happy with that.
[00:37:54] Gerard Donnelly: Yeah.
[00:37:55] Gerard Donnelly: Yeah.
[00:37:56] Abby Jorgensen: We talked about the FTP, and he knew right away, because I didn't even say, I'm I'm going
[00:38:00] Abby Jorgensen: Anything.
[00:38:00] Abby Jorgensen: I was just like, he's like, I know, before you say it, I'm like, yeah, that's great.
[00:38:09] Gerard Donnelly: So what's his race?
[00:38:11] Gerard Donnelly: Indy Mini Marathon, Muncie, July.
[00:38:14] Gerard Donnelly: Oh, good.
[00:38:15] Gerard Donnelly: That's Tyler's doing that race as well that I catch.
[00:38:21] Gerard Donnelly: Um, so, yeah, he's, he's a 48 minute 10K runner.
[00:38:32] Gerard Donnelly: So, um, so you're going to give him strength efforts and VO2.
[00:38:38] Gerard Donnelly: That's great.
[00:38:39] Gerard Donnelly: Um, is he, where's he live, Abby?
[00:38:43] Abby Jorgensen: Um, Muncie, or Fort Wayne, Indiana.
[00:38:46] Abby Jorgensen: Indiana.
[00:38:47] Gerard Donnelly: It's Central America, is it?
[00:38:48] Gerard Donnelly: Yeah, it's not far from here.
[00:38:51] Abby Jorgensen: It's, they get the same, they get our weather to like, Okay.
[00:38:55] Gerard Donnelly: Yep.
[00:38:55] Gerard Donnelly: Okay.
[00:38:56] Gerard Donnelly: So he's indoor.
[00:38:57] Gerard Donnelly: He's indoor.
[00:38:57] Gerard Donnelly: Uh, for the most part.
[00:38:59] Abby Jorgensen: Yeah, he.
[00:39:00] Abby Jorgensen: If they get periods like us where we can go outside, it just depends.
[00:39:03] Abby Jorgensen: Yeah, he's run that 10K outside, hasn't he?
[00:39:06] Abby Jorgensen: Yeah, they got a decent day on whatever day it's Saturday.
[00:39:10] Abby Jorgensen: Yep.
[00:39:12] Gerard Donnelly: My geography's no good.
[00:39:15] Abby Jorgensen: I mean, mine isn't outside of the U.S.
[00:39:18] Abby Jorgensen: either, so.
[00:39:19] Abby Jorgensen: You're over here, aren't you?
[00:39:20] Gerard Donnelly: Yep.
[00:39:22] Gerard Donnelly: Yep, so it's the same latitude as you.
[00:39:25] Gerard Donnelly: Yeah, it's like 11-hour drive.
[00:39:28] Abby Jorgensen: Yep, okay.
[00:39:30] Gerard Donnelly: All right.
[00:39:31] Gerard Donnelly: So he's happy?
[00:39:32] Abby Jorgensen: Yep, he's good, and so we'll focus on that half marathon coming up in May.
[00:39:39] Abby Jorgensen: We'll swim just once a week.
[00:39:41] Abby Jorgensen: He wanted to just swim once a week for now because his swim is kind of like mine and just kind of stay steady.
[00:39:50] Gerard Donnelly: Don't be afraid to – what's his longest run?
[00:39:54] Gerard Donnelly: Has it been 70?
[00:39:57] Gerard Donnelly: Yep.
[00:39:58] Gerard Donnelly: Thank you.
[00:40:00] Gerard Donnelly: Yeah.
[00:40:01] Gerard Donnelly: When's the half marathon?
[00:40:02] Gerard Donnelly: May, is it?
[00:40:03] Gerard Donnelly: May.
[00:40:04] Gerard Donnelly: Yeah.
[00:40:05] Gerard Donnelly: Yeah, don't be afraid to push you a bit more on the run, you know, 110 maybe.
[00:40:10] Gerard Donnelly: Okay.
[00:40:11] Gerard Donnelly: And maybe a bit longer here, Abby.
[00:40:14] Gerard Donnelly: Okay.
[00:40:16] Gerard Donnelly: Make the runs sort of 50 and then 55, then 60, you know, 60 minutes.
[00:40:21] Gerard Donnelly: So 60, 60, you know, 70, 80, 90 over the three weeks.
[00:40:26] Gerard Donnelly: Okay.
[00:40:27] Gerard Donnelly: Okay?
[00:40:28] Gerard Donnelly: Yep.
[00:40:30] Gerard Donnelly: Sin?
[00:40:32] Gerard Donnelly: He's good.
[00:40:32] Abby Jorgensen: He went up to the mountains and forgot to tell me on Saturday, Sunday, but he's back.
[00:40:38] Gerard Donnelly: Yep.
[00:40:41] Abby Jorgensen: Because when I texted him, he's like, I forgot to tell you, I was going back to the mountains.
[00:40:44] Abby Jorgensen: So it's fine.
[00:40:46] Gerard Donnelly: At least he did arrive when he got back.
[00:40:49] Gerard Donnelly: Yeah, that's what I was like.
[00:40:50] Abby Jorgensen: At least you did something when you got home.
[00:40:52] Gerard Donnelly: I always just jam in there just to make sure it looks like he's done something.
[00:40:58] Gerard Donnelly: I've done that occasionally.
[00:40:59] Gerard Donnelly: I've done I've just...
[00:41:00] Abby Jorgensen: I checked, he did something random on Slipped.
[00:41:06] Gerard Donnelly: He has run, so.
[00:41:11] Gerard Donnelly: Can you hear that noise, Abby?
[00:41:13] Gerard Donnelly: Yeah.
[00:41:15] Gerard Donnelly: Sorry, there's a guy sanding the weather boards one meter away from me.
[00:41:19] Gerard Donnelly: I'm sorry.
[00:41:20] Gerard Donnelly: No, you're fine.
[00:41:21] Abby Jorgensen: Sometimes my dogs make noises and I...
[00:41:24] Abby Jorgensen: Yeah.
[00:41:26] Gerard Donnelly: Okay.
[00:41:26] Gerard Donnelly: Okay, so the same, VO2 and strength, that's great.
[00:41:33] Abby Jorgensen: Yeah, he has Wednesdays off now, so I made Wednesdays a little longer for him, so.
[00:41:41] Gerard Donnelly: So is he, does he know about Zwift?
[00:41:44] Gerard Donnelly: Yeah, he's on Zwift all the time.
[00:41:46] Gerard Donnelly: Yeah, so can he do a Zwift race or...
[00:41:52] Gerard Donnelly: So if he's indoor, it's hard to ride for two hours, that's what I'm saying.
[00:41:56] Abby Jorgensen: Oh, I can ask him, yeah.
[00:41:58] Gerard Donnelly: With that structure, I wouldn't...
[00:41:59] Gerard Donnelly: wouldn't...
[00:42:00] Gerard Donnelly: give anybody just a two-hour indoor session unless they're joining a race or an event or something.
[00:42:06] Gerard Donnelly: Okay.
[00:42:09] Gerard Donnelly: So if you've given him that on a Saturday, try to give him something like, if he's on Zwift, this is a good one, I'd get him to do Alpe d'Huez.
[00:42:32] Abby Jorgensen: Oh, yeah.
[00:42:34] Gerard Donnelly: And just add a longer warm-up and cool-down.
[00:42:37] Gerard Donnelly: That would be something that he's, you know, he can try to stay in the ranges.
[00:42:41] Gerard Donnelly: you want to try that?
[00:42:43] Gerard Donnelly: Yeah.
[00:42:43] Abby Jorgensen: I like that one.
[00:42:44] Abby Jorgensen: And it usually is sometimes longer than an hour 20 for some people.
[00:42:48] Abby Jorgensen: Just depends, I guess.
[00:42:49] Gerard Donnelly: Plus a warm-up and cool-down and you get these two hours.
[00:42:51] Gerard Donnelly: Yeah.
[00:42:52] Gerard Donnelly: It's really good pressure on the pedals.
[00:42:54] Gerard Donnelly: Okay.
[00:42:55] Gerard Donnelly: Yep.
[00:42:59] Abby Jorgensen: That is- isn't
[00:43:00] Abby Jorgensen: I if a strength one on Tuesday and like the hill on Wednesday.
[00:43:06] Gerard Donnelly: Yeah, it's early in his season, so it's January, so it's okay.
[00:43:11] Gerard Donnelly: And, you know, these are at threshold and this is at zone two, so he should try to have a higher cadence if he can.
[00:43:21] Gerard Donnelly: We're not trying to do a strength effort here.
[00:43:27] Gerard Donnelly: Unless I say that.
[00:43:28] Gerard Donnelly: Oh, yeah, strength effort.
[00:43:29] Gerard Donnelly: Yeah, I mean, one of them is not one.
[00:43:32] Abby Jorgensen: I think it says non-strength.
[00:43:35] Gerard Donnelly: Yeah, or you muck around with that one.
[00:43:38] Abby Jorgensen: Yeah, I'll put a note in here.
[00:43:43] Gerard Donnelly: Okay.
[00:43:47] Gerard Donnelly: Chris?
[00:43:48] Abby Jorgensen: Chris, he's doing, he tested too and he did awesome as well.
[00:43:57] Abby Jorgensen: His swim went really well.
[00:43:58] Abby Jorgensen: He does.
[00:43:59] Abby Jorgensen: Yeah.
[00:43:59] Abby Jorgensen: Yeah.
[00:43:59] Abby Jorgensen: Okay.
[00:44:00] Abby Jorgensen: Increased FTP, and then his 10K was...
[00:44:03] Gerard Donnelly: That's great.
[00:44:04] Gerard Donnelly: Well done.
[00:44:05] Gerard Donnelly: It's a 9-watt, 8-watt improvement.
[00:44:08] Gerard Donnelly: Mm-hmm.
[00:44:11] Gerard Donnelly: And then, yeah.
[00:44:13] Gerard Donnelly: Good 10K.
[00:44:16] Abby Jorgensen: I just told him, yeah, his final 5K was only 10 seconds off his best 5K, or his first 5K he did at those.
[00:44:24] Gerard Donnelly: So 23, 26.
[00:44:26] Gerard Donnelly: Wow.
[00:44:27] Gerard Donnelly: That's good, isn't it?
[00:44:28] Gerard Donnelly: Mm-hmm.
[00:44:30] Abby Jorgensen: Well done.
[00:44:31] Gerard Donnelly: You'd be happy?
[00:44:32] Gerard Donnelly: Yeah.
[00:44:34] Abby Jorgensen: He's said that it must be working.
[00:44:38] Gerard Donnelly: He told me that.
[00:44:39] Gerard Donnelly: Yeah, very good.
[00:44:40] Gerard Donnelly: Yep.
[00:44:40] Gerard Donnelly: Yeah.
[00:44:41] Gerard Donnelly: he swum better as well.
[00:44:43] Gerard Donnelly: swum a minute and a half quicker.
[00:44:45] Gerard Donnelly: That's great.
[00:44:48] Gerard Donnelly: And he's outside in his long rides?
[00:44:51] Gerard Donnelly: Yeah, he's in California, so.
[00:44:53] Gerard Donnelly: Lucky man.
[00:44:55] Gerard Donnelly: I know.
[00:44:56] Gerard Donnelly: No.
[00:44:58] Gerard Donnelly: No.
[00:44:58] Gerard Donnelly: Thank you.
[00:45:00] Gerard Donnelly: Oh, yeah.
[00:45:08] Gerard Donnelly: That's good.
[00:45:16] Gerard Donnelly: What's his event?
[00:45:20] Abby Jorgensen: He's got a half marathon, has he?
[00:45:22] Gerard Donnelly: Yeah, but his main event is Oceanside.
[00:45:27] Abby Jorgensen: Yeah, that's eight, nine, ten weeks away.
[00:45:31] Gerard Donnelly: Is that the 70.3 Oceanside, is it?
[00:45:33] Gerard Donnelly: Yeah.
[00:45:34] Gerard Donnelly: Yeah.
[00:45:35] Gerard Donnelly: Thank goodness.
[00:45:38] Gerard Donnelly: So have you got a bit of a plan for his half?
[00:45:41] Abby Jorgensen: Yeah, we talked what day was that Saturday night.
[00:45:46] Abby Jorgensen: He wants to, he's more using it for a training run.
[00:45:49] Abby Jorgensen: Yeah, great.
[00:45:51] Abby Jorgensen: But we have a little bit of a plan.
[00:45:56] Gerard Donnelly: So where do you run, 48.07?
[00:45:59] Gerard Donnelly: Is that where you run?
[00:46:01] Gerard Donnelly: Yeah, what did I tell him, because I went to Macmillan.
[00:46:05] Gerard Donnelly: Yeah, what did it say?
[00:46:07] Gerard Donnelly: I'll text it in.
[00:46:17] Gerard Donnelly: I can't find it.
[00:46:20] Gerard Donnelly: That's alright.
[00:46:21] Gerard Donnelly: 48.
[00:46:27] Gerard Donnelly: Okay.
[00:46:30] Gerard Donnelly: No, 147.
[00:46:32] Gerard Donnelly: Oh yeah, that's right.
[00:46:33] Gerard Donnelly: Yep.
[00:46:34] Gerard Donnelly: So, I'd be saying to him, aiming for 150.
[00:46:39] Gerard Donnelly: Yep, that was 150 to 151.
[00:46:42] Abby Jorgensen: Yep, great.
[00:46:43] Gerard Donnelly: Yep.
[00:46:44] Gerard Donnelly: Well done.
[00:46:47] Gerard Donnelly: Abby, I'm just going to, I've got to put the bin out.
[00:46:52] Gerard Donnelly: You're on fine.
[00:46:55] Gerard Donnelly: I'm going Go.
[00:46:57] Gerard Donnelly: Go.
[00:46:58] Gerard Donnelly: Go.
[00:46:59] Gerard Donnelly: Go.
[00:47:07] Gerard Donnelly: Thank you.
[00:47:30] Abby Jorgensen: Thank you.
[00:48:05] Gerard Donnelly: Thank you.
[00:48:07] Gerard Donnelly: Thank you.
[00:48:23] Gerard Donnelly: Sorry.
[00:48:24] Gerard Donnelly: It's fine.
[00:48:28] Gerard Donnelly: Alright, so that's a good plan?
[00:48:31] Gerard Donnelly: Yeah.
[00:48:33] Gerard Donnelly: And he's not changing the week's program for it?
[00:48:36] Gerard Donnelly: Yeah.
[00:48:36] Gerard Donnelly: He told me he just wants to train right through it.
[00:48:38] Abby Jorgensen: Yeah.
[00:48:39] Gerard Donnelly: So.
[00:48:40] Abby Jorgensen: I gave him a little bit on Friday.
[00:48:43] Gerard Donnelly: Yes.
[00:48:43] Gerard Donnelly: Yeah.
[00:48:46] Gerard Donnelly: Yeah.
[00:48:47] Gerard Donnelly: Maybe just that pre-race one.
[00:48:50] Gerard Donnelly: I'd just, I'd just bump that up to six minutes.
[00:48:55] Gerard Donnelly: Okay.
[00:48:57] Gerard Donnelly: So, I don't know, it's 66.
[00:48:59] Gerard Donnelly: 66.
[00:49:07] Gerard Donnelly: Good.
[00:49:08] Gerard Donnelly: All right.
[00:49:11] Abby Jorgensen: Fantastic.
[00:49:12] Gerard Donnelly: Kevin?
[00:49:15] Abby Jorgensen: Should be in a deload week this week.
[00:49:18] Abby Jorgensen: Or wait.
[00:49:18] Abby Jorgensen: Yeah.
[00:49:20] Abby Jorgensen: I think so.
[00:49:22] Abby Jorgensen: Yeah.
[00:49:23] Abby Jorgensen: Yep.
[00:49:23] Abby Jorgensen: And testing.
[00:49:24] Abby Jorgensen: Yep.
[00:49:24] Gerard Donnelly: OK.
[00:49:26] Gerard Donnelly: You happy with the way he's going?
[00:49:28] Gerard Donnelly: Yeah.
[00:49:29] Gerard Donnelly: I messaged him today.
[00:49:31] Abby Jorgensen: I'm trying to figure out if we can do anything different with his running.
[00:49:36] Gerard Donnelly: So.
[00:49:37] Gerard Donnelly: Yeah.
[00:49:38] Gerard Donnelly: He's coming back from injury, is he?
[00:49:40] Gerard Donnelly: Yeah.
[00:49:41] Gerard Donnelly: He's been doing the incline running.
[00:49:43] Gerard Donnelly: Yeah.
[00:49:46] Gerard Donnelly: Which I asked around and they are so confused with it.
[00:49:52] Gerard Donnelly: Yeah.
[00:49:52] Abby Jorgensen: All of them and me too.
[00:49:54] Abby Jorgensen: So.
[00:49:55] Abby Jorgensen: Yeah.
[00:49:58] Gerard Donnelly: Good.
[00:49:58] Gerard Donnelly: That's fine.
[00:49:59] Gerard Donnelly: fine.
[00:50:00] Gerard Donnelly: Yeah.
[00:50:00] Gerard Donnelly: Richard?
[00:50:02] Gerard Donnelly: He's doing well.
[00:50:04] Abby Jorgensen: I'm trying to think.
[00:50:06] Abby Jorgensen: I think we just had a normal week.
[00:50:08] Abby Jorgensen: I'm trying to...
[00:50:09] Gerard Donnelly: Yeah, that's okay.
[00:50:11] Gerard Donnelly: What are we up to?
[00:50:12] Gerard Donnelly: Week two.
[00:50:13] Gerard Donnelly: You hit week two?
[00:50:15] Gerard Donnelly: So he's just resumed after...
[00:50:18] Gerard Donnelly: After just...
[00:50:20] Gerard Donnelly: Yep, he got back to 200 watts, didn't he, for his FTP?
[00:50:24] Gerard Donnelly: And he ran a 5K, a little bit slower, wasn't it?
[00:50:27] Gerard Donnelly: But that's...
[00:50:28] Gerard Donnelly: Yeah, but he was coming off of, like, a run injury, so he's kind of back to...
[00:50:33] Gerard Donnelly: Yeah.
[00:50:35] Gerard Donnelly: So descending in 30s, yep, good.
[00:50:37] Gerard Donnelly: Yeah.
[00:50:39] Gerard Donnelly: He's been feeling good, too, so...
[00:50:41] Gerard Donnelly: Are you one run short there?
[00:50:42] Gerard Donnelly: No, he keeps missing that Monday, does he?
[00:50:45] Gerard Donnelly: No, it's not done yet.
[00:50:48] Abby Jorgensen: Yes.
[00:50:50] Gerard Donnelly: It's a block there.
[00:50:51] Gerard Donnelly: Exactly what I did last week.
[00:50:56] Gerard Donnelly: See, your memory is getting better.
[00:50:58] Abby Jorgensen: I know.
[00:50:58] Abby Jorgensen: So just add...
[00:51:00] Gerard Donnelly: One more run off the bike here, okay?
[00:51:02] Gerard Donnelly: One more?
[00:51:03] Gerard Donnelly: You have.
[00:51:04] Gerard Donnelly: You've already done it.
[00:51:05] Gerard Donnelly: I'm looking at the wrong one.
[00:51:05] Gerard Donnelly: I should shut up and just keep going.
[00:51:09] Gerard Donnelly: So I'm happy with that.
[00:51:10] Gerard Donnelly: That's great.
[00:51:10] Gerard Donnelly: Anything on Richard?
[00:51:12] Abby Jorgensen: I don't know.
[00:51:13] Abby Jorgensen: Like, I think he keeps telling me he's feeling like he's feeling the best he has in a while, so.
[00:51:19] Gerard Donnelly: Fantastic.
[00:51:21] Abby Jorgensen: Yeah, he has, like, some Olympic distance races, some sprints, so nothing bigger than Olympic distance, so.
[00:51:27] Abby Jorgensen: Yep.
[00:51:29] Gerard Donnelly: That's good.
[00:51:29] Gerard Donnelly: He's training well, then, for that.
[00:51:32] Abby Jorgensen: How long should the long runs be for that?
[00:51:34] Abby Jorgensen: Not much over an hour, like hour 15, maybe?
[00:51:37] Abby Jorgensen: Yeah, don't think of it like that.
[00:51:38] Gerard Donnelly: Think of it like, I want to get you running fit, and we just want to progress the run up to 90 minutes.
[00:51:46] Gerard Donnelly: Whether you're running a 5K, an 800 meter, or a 10K, a half marathon, you just want to increase your running endurance run over years.
[00:51:57] Gerard Donnelly: You want to, you want to make.
[00:51:59] Gerard Donnelly: Thank you.
[00:52:00] Gerard Donnelly: An hour 30 easy, then an hour 45 becomes easy, then two hours becomes easy.
[00:52:04] Gerard Donnelly: As a runner, you want to develop the endurance run.
[00:52:07] Gerard Donnelly: It doesn't matter what, you know, I've got guys who are doing 1500 metres on a track, and I've got them running their long run hour 30.
[00:52:16] Gerard Donnelly: So, you know, it's super important that you just gradually progress that long run.
[00:52:21] Gerard Donnelly: Yeah, that makes sense.
[00:52:24] Gerard Donnelly: I know like eight miles seems like nothing to me anymore.
[00:52:27] Abby Jorgensen: Yeah, because, you know, you're used to running four hours.
[00:52:31] Gerard Donnelly: So, how did Michaela go?
[00:52:34] Gerard Donnelly: Testing.
[00:52:35] Abby Jorgensen: I mean, her FTP was a lot lower, but, I mean.
[00:52:39] Gerard Donnelly: Is it a new bike, was it, or?
[00:52:42] Abby Jorgensen: Yeah, it's a new TT bike.
[00:52:43] Abby Jorgensen: She hasn't ever been on a TT bike.
[00:52:45] Abby Jorgensen: Yes, great.
[00:52:47] Abby Jorgensen: Yeah, I was like, first off, you can't push as much power usually in TT position versus.
[00:52:54] Gerard Donnelly: And she learned at that?
[00:52:55] Gerard Donnelly: So, your advice was spot on, which is.
[00:52:59] Gerard Donnelly: Yeah.
[00:53:00] Gerard Donnelly: Yeah.
[00:53:00] Abby Jorgensen: She just, you know, like when you're mentally at a 180.
[00:53:04] Gerard Donnelly: Yes.
[00:53:05] Gerard Donnelly: I had a walk through it.
[00:53:07] Gerard Donnelly: Her heart rate was 183, 188.
[00:53:10] Gerard Donnelly: Last time was 189, 194.
[00:53:13] Gerard Donnelly: So she's fractionally lower in the heart rate.
[00:53:16] Gerard Donnelly: Cadence is fine.
[00:53:20] Gerard Donnelly: No, it's a new line in the sand.
[00:53:23] Gerard Donnelly: That's great.
[00:53:23] Gerard Donnelly: Yeah, that's what I told her.
[00:53:26] Gerard Donnelly: Same with her, her swim.
[00:53:29] Abby Jorgensen: But then, like, she was, she was upset.
[00:53:31] Abby Jorgensen: And then we got talking and then she's like, well, it wasn't a 50 meter pool.
[00:53:35] Abby Jorgensen: And I'm like, why didn't you lead with that?
[00:53:38] Abby Jorgensen: Yes.
[00:53:39] Gerard Donnelly: Yeah.
[00:53:39] Gerard Donnelly: Like, it's gonna be slower.
[00:53:41] Abby Jorgensen: She's like, oh.
[00:53:43] Gerard Donnelly: Yeah, it's way slower.
[00:53:45] Gerard Donnelly: Yeah.
[00:53:46] Abby Jorgensen: So.
[00:53:47] Gerard Donnelly: We didn't run test her because she's been injured.
[00:53:50] Gerard Donnelly: Yep.
[00:53:50] Gerard Donnelly: She's just coming off an ankle issue.
[00:53:53] Gerard Donnelly: But.
[00:53:55] Gerard Donnelly: Yep.
[00:53:56] Gerard Donnelly: It's better now.
[00:53:57] Abby Jorgensen: Yep.
[00:53:58] Abby Jorgensen: So she's starting her.
[00:54:00] Gerard Donnelly: program again?
[00:54:01] Gerard Donnelly: Yeah.
[00:54:03] Abby Jorgensen: Yeah.
[00:54:03] Abby Jorgensen: And look, just be careful, Abby.
[00:54:05] Gerard Donnelly: Just don't do these back-to-back runs.
[00:54:07] Gerard Donnelly: That's a run, run, run.
[00:54:09] Gerard Donnelly: And she's missed yesterday's run.
[00:54:11] Gerard Donnelly: Anyway.
[00:54:13] Gerard Donnelly: She was traveling, so we didn't know.
[00:54:16] Abby Jorgensen: Yeah.
[00:54:16] Abby Jorgensen: Okay.
[00:54:18] Gerard Donnelly: Go swim.
[00:54:19] Gerard Donnelly: I'd do a run or a shorter ride.
[00:54:21] Gerard Donnelly: Yeah.
[00:54:21] Gerard Donnelly: So I'd be definitely giving her a run, a shorter ride, just because she's run there.
[00:54:30] Gerard Donnelly: Run there.
[00:54:30] Gerard Donnelly: You know, you wouldn't want to do three days in row.
[00:54:32] Gerard Donnelly: Just be careful of that, okay?
[00:54:34] Gerard Donnelly: Okay.
[00:54:35] Gerard Donnelly: We've got to try and avoid any opportunity to injure our athletes.
[00:54:39] Gerard Donnelly: And really good runners can afford to run three days in a row.
[00:54:44] Gerard Donnelly: You're in that category now.
[00:54:46] Gerard Donnelly: But people have been susceptible to injury.
[00:54:49] Gerard Donnelly: There's no way.
[00:54:50] Gerard Donnelly: We shouldn't, you know, I'm always trying to give them to run alternate days.
[00:54:53] Gerard Donnelly: And then maybe on the weekend, they run Sunday, Sunday.
[00:54:56] Gerard Donnelly: Okay.
[00:54:57] Gerard Donnelly: But we never want to run them Friday, Sunday, Sunday, Monday.
[00:54:59] Gerard Donnelly: Bye.
[00:54:59] Gerard Donnelly: Bye.
[00:55:00] Gerard Donnelly: Stuff like that.
[00:55:02] Gerard Donnelly: Okay.
[00:55:02] Gerard Donnelly: And if she says, you know, I could do a shorter ride or run, great.
[00:55:06] Gerard Donnelly: Just do the ride.
[00:55:07] Gerard Donnelly: Okay.
[00:55:08] Gerard Donnelly: And I'd rather she did the ride than Pilates.
[00:55:10] Gerard Donnelly: But anyway, that's fine.
[00:55:11] Gerard Donnelly: I mean, yeah, I don't know what.
[00:55:13] Abby Jorgensen: At least she did something.
[00:55:14] Gerard Donnelly: That's absolutely fine.
[00:55:17] Gerard Donnelly: She's better off doing the Pilates than running, by the way.
[00:55:19] Gerard Donnelly: That's how I would.
[00:55:21] Gerard Donnelly: Yeah.
[00:55:22] Abby Jorgensen: I mean, with her, she lacks the strength too.
[00:55:24] Abby Jorgensen: So that's why she keeps getting injured.
[00:55:28] Abby Jorgensen: Yes.
[00:55:32] Gerard Donnelly: Maybe, maybe we'd swap that.
[00:55:35] Gerard Donnelly: Like it's, it's lunchtime there in New Zealand.
[00:55:39] Gerard Donnelly: Now, I'd choose.
[00:55:41] Gerard Donnelly: So maybe I would swap that, Abby, to have a longer run.
[00:55:46] Gerard Donnelly: She's going to message me and be like, oh.
[00:55:50] Gerard Donnelly: Well, she hasn't done it yet.
[00:55:53] Gerard Donnelly: So just text her saying, because we missed yesterday's run, just going to add another 10 minutes.
[00:55:59] Gerard Donnelly: Okay?
[00:56:00] Gerard Donnelly: Okay.
[00:56:06] Gerard Donnelly: And just be careful, you're giving her two sub-thresholds?
[00:56:10] Gerard Donnelly: What's going on here?
[00:56:13] Abby Jorgensen: Well, she's in, she traveled and is not going to have an indoor trainer, so I just was trying to, because she has a 70.3 coming up.
[00:56:23] Abby Jorgensen: Yep.
[00:56:24] Abby Jorgensen: I was trying to get her used to.
[00:56:26] Gerard Donnelly: Yes.
[00:56:27] Gerard Donnelly: Yep.
[00:56:28] Gerard Donnelly: But is that outside?
[00:56:30] Gerard Donnelly: Is that what you're doing?
[00:56:31] Gerard Donnelly: Yeah, they're outside.
[00:56:32] Gerard Donnelly: Yeah, but don't do the same session.
[00:56:34] Gerard Donnelly: Okay.
[00:56:34] Gerard Donnelly: mean, they both pick something else.
[00:56:38] Gerard Donnelly: So, you know, I would be getting her to do something like over-under threshold.
[00:56:46] Gerard Donnelly: So she's got a time trial on Sunday, Saturday, is that right?
[00:56:49] Gerard Donnelly: Yeah.
[00:56:51] Gerard Donnelly: Yeah.
[00:56:53] Gerard Donnelly: Should we just do another easy route?
[00:56:55] Abby Jorgensen: No, no, so it's either VO2 or threshold.
[00:56:58] Gerard Donnelly: You want to do, like, something...
[00:56:59] Gerard Donnelly: You
[00:57:00] Gerard Donnelly: Has she done many VO2 sets?
[00:57:06] Gerard Donnelly: Just get her to rev her legs.
[00:57:15] Gerard Donnelly: She's going to be outside, isn't she?
[00:57:17] Gerard Donnelly: Yeah, that's why I was debating what the… Yeah, well, maybe.
[00:57:21] Gerard Donnelly: Trying to get her used to that TT bike as well.
[00:57:24] Abby Jorgensen: Yeah.
[00:57:26] Gerard Donnelly: But… No, you're right, but we just never want to do the same session twice in one week.
[00:57:32] Gerard Donnelly: We've got… I would say she's got a good outdoor course to do, is she right?
[00:57:40] Abby Jorgensen: I think so, from the way it sounded.
[00:57:44] Gerard Donnelly: I would give her this session.
[00:57:47] Gerard Donnelly: Okay.
[00:57:52] Gerard Donnelly: It's actually training stress score less.
[00:57:58] Gerard Donnelly: Okay?
[00:57:59] Gerard Donnelly: Even though it's got…
[00:58:00] Gerard Donnelly: But you know why that's changed?
[00:58:02] Gerard Donnelly: Because it's the warm-up and cool-down is shorter.
[00:58:05] Gerard Donnelly: Yeah.
[00:58:10] Gerard Donnelly: So, yeah, I mean, just make that 15 minutes.
[00:58:15] Gerard Donnelly: If she's got the time.
[00:58:17] Gerard Donnelly: Yeah, she should.
[00:58:18] Abby Jorgensen: She's there for training and vacation.
[00:58:22] Gerard Donnelly: Yeah.
[00:58:24] Gerard Donnelly: You can actually make that 20 if you wanted to, just at the end.
[00:58:26] Gerard Donnelly: just getting used to the TT bike position.
[00:58:30] Gerard Donnelly: Okay?
[00:58:30] Gerard Donnelly: Okay.
[00:58:35] Gerard Donnelly: Good.
[00:58:36] Gerard Donnelly: All right.
[00:58:36] Gerard Donnelly: That's great.
[00:58:42] Gerard Donnelly: Yes.
[00:58:45] Gerard Donnelly: Who are up to?
[00:58:46] Gerard Donnelly: Blair?
[00:58:48] Gerard Donnelly: Just getting back.
[00:58:51] Abby Jorgensen: So I just started him with a, like, a nice, easy week.
[00:58:56] Gerard Donnelly: Yeah, great.
[00:58:57] Abby Jorgensen: To get back into things.
[00:59:00] Abby Jorgensen: Yeah.
[00:59:01] Gerard Donnelly: Yeah.
[00:59:01] Gerard Donnelly: When's the last time he tested?
[00:59:06] Gerard Donnelly: Quite a while.
[00:59:07] Gerard Donnelly: Yeah.
[00:59:07] Abby Jorgensen: That's why he needs to be tested, but I wasn't going to.
[00:59:11] Abby Jorgensen: Yeah.
[00:59:11] Gerard Donnelly: Like.
[00:59:12] Gerard Donnelly: Yeah.
[00:59:13] Gerard Donnelly: So test him next week, Abby.
[00:59:14] Gerard Donnelly: That was the plan.
[00:59:16] Gerard Donnelly: Yeah.
[00:59:16] Gerard Donnelly: Good.
[00:59:17] Gerard Donnelly: Yeah.
[00:59:18] Gerard Donnelly: Yeah.
[00:59:19] Gerard Donnelly: All right.
[00:59:20] Gerard Donnelly: Pemberton.
[00:59:22] Abby Jorgensen: She tested as well last week.
[00:59:25] Abby Jorgensen: A very good, good testing week for her.
[00:59:31] Gerard Donnelly: Yeah.
[00:59:31] Gerard Donnelly: She's not improving on the bike, is she?
[00:59:34] Gerard Donnelly: What's going on?
[00:59:35] Abby Jorgensen: Well, so we figured out that she was using the kicker power, which is 10 watts higher.
[00:59:47] Abby Jorgensen: So this one is with her actual pedals.
[00:59:52] Abby Jorgensen: Yes.
[00:59:53] Gerard Donnelly: I'm going to put that in the spreadsheet.
[00:59:55] Gerard Donnelly: So.
[00:59:55] Gerard Donnelly: Okay.
[00:59:57] Gerard Donnelly: So the first test was with her.
[01:00:00] Abby Jorgensen: The first two were with her kicker because she was wondering why her – because her other sessions, she said, felt hard and we were trying to figure out why and we finally figured out it was connecting with the kicker.
[01:00:19] Gerard Donnelly: Yeah, well, that's great then.
[01:00:20] Gerard Donnelly: So that's really – that's like – add 10 watts, it's like 214, isn't it?
[01:00:26] Gerard Donnelly: Yeah, that's what she said.
[01:00:27] Abby Jorgensen: So the kicker would have been 214.
[01:00:30] Gerard Donnelly: Yeah.
[01:00:31] Gerard Donnelly: And she would have – Yeah.
[01:00:34] Gerard Donnelly: And run-wise?
[01:00:37] Abby Jorgensen: Also very, like, very happy with her run.
[01:00:41] Abby Jorgensen: Yeah.
[01:00:42] Abby Jorgensen: The last 10K she did wasn't with us, but she ran, walked it.
[01:00:46] Abby Jorgensen: So this one, she ran the whole distance.
[01:00:49] Gerard Donnelly: Yeah, that's great.
[01:00:50] Gerard Donnelly: It's a good time.
[01:00:53] Gerard Donnelly: Very good.
[01:00:57] Gerard Donnelly: Chattanooga in May, okay.
[01:00:58] Gerard Donnelly: So – So too.
[01:01:00] Abby Jorgensen: And then our swim improved to, I think, 45 seconds.
[01:01:03] Abby Jorgensen: Well done, Abby.
[01:01:04] Gerard Donnelly: That's three great training efforts.
[01:01:08] Gerard Donnelly: So week one, new block.
[01:01:14] Gerard Donnelly: Yeah.
[01:01:15] Gerard Donnelly: So one run there, one run there, one run there, one run there, okay.
[01:01:21] Gerard Donnelly: What's her longest run been?
[01:01:25] Abby Jorgensen: Longest continuous one?
[01:01:26] Abby Jorgensen: Yeah, 40.
[01:01:27] Gerard Donnelly: 40, is it?
[01:01:28] Gerard Donnelly: Yep.
[01:01:28] Gerard Donnelly: Yeah.
[01:01:29] Gerard Donnelly: You're just bringing her along, actually.
[01:01:31] Gerard Donnelly: That's what we're doing, yep.
[01:01:33] Gerard Donnelly: Because she was run walking up until, like, two weeks ago still.
[01:01:36] Gerard Donnelly: Yeah, that's great.
[01:01:37] Gerard Donnelly: Yep.
[01:01:38] Gerard Donnelly: Yep, fantastic.
[01:01:41] Gerard Donnelly: Your program's fine.
[01:01:43] Abby Jorgensen: And I think she's traveling this week, but she took our trainer with her, so we have it all figured out.
[01:01:49] Gerard Donnelly: Brilliant.
[01:01:50] Gerard Donnelly: Anything on her?
[01:01:52] Gerard Donnelly: Nope.
[01:01:52] Abby Jorgensen: She's doing good.
[01:01:55] Gerard Donnelly: Okay.
[01:01:57] Gerard Donnelly: What's that worth going?
[01:01:59] Gerard Donnelly: Okay.
[01:01:59] Gerard Donnelly: Um...
[01:02:00] Abby Jorgensen: I mean, besides, I mean, he's back on, he tested last week too, so he, I think his FTP was like one lower than, which I was like, to only be one lower after an Ironman and basically taking a full month of not doing a whole lot.
[01:02:20] Gerard Donnelly: Yeah, that's great.
[01:02:22] Abby Jorgensen: And his 10K was, I feel like it was really well ran.
[01:02:27] Gerard Donnelly: He actually executed it perfectly.
[01:02:29] Gerard Donnelly: I'm just looking at his execution, Abby, and his FTP.
[01:02:34] Gerard Donnelly: His first five minutes, 225, last five minutes, 270.
[01:02:39] Gerard Donnelly: So I'd say he left a lot.
[01:02:42] Gerard Donnelly: Yeah, we didn't know, like, with him coming on Ironman.
[01:02:47] Gerard Donnelly: I totally agree.
[01:02:49] Gerard Donnelly: Yeah.
[01:02:50] Gerard Donnelly: I think he would have been pleasantly surprised.
[01:02:52] Gerard Donnelly: Oh, look at that.
[01:02:53] Gerard Donnelly: That's great.
[01:02:54] Gerard Donnelly: Well done.
[01:02:57] Gerard Donnelly: 10K, Ryan, how'd it go?
[01:02:59] Abby Jorgensen: He...
[01:02:59] Abby Jorgensen: He...
[01:03:00] Abby Jorgensen: He executed it perfectly.
[01:03:02] Abby Jorgensen: I think he has negative split it.
[01:03:04] Gerard Donnelly: think there might have been one in there and it wasn't, but.
[01:03:08] Gerard Donnelly: 430, 412.
[01:03:09] Gerard Donnelly: right.
[01:03:10] Gerard Donnelly: She's got to be happy with that.
[01:03:13] Abby Jorgensen: Yeah.
[01:03:14] Abby Jorgensen: He wants his running to improve, so.
[01:03:16] Gerard Donnelly: Yeah.
[01:03:18] Abby Jorgensen: He had, like, I moved, I don't know where he moved the, they had flooding there yesterday, so.
[01:03:25] Abby Jorgensen: Just moved to the screen, yeah.
[01:03:26] Abby Jorgensen: Yeah, they had, like, his back, like, wall, landscape wall, it all came down from the flooding, so.
[01:03:35] Gerard Donnelly: What's he training for now?
[01:03:37] Gerard Donnelly: Sprint try.
[01:03:39] Abby Jorgensen: Sprint, and then just some questionable, like, he just doesn't know.
[01:03:45] Abby Jorgensen: Some 73s and some other random stuff.
[01:03:51] Abby Jorgensen: All right.
[01:03:52] Abby Jorgensen: I gave him some strength work to do.
[01:03:55] Abby Jorgensen: Yeah.
[01:03:56] Abby Jorgensen: As well, so.
[01:03:57] Abby Jorgensen: Well done.
[01:03:58] Gerard Donnelly: done.
[01:04:05] Gerard Donnelly: Good.
[01:04:09] Gerard Donnelly: Mario, how's he coming along?
[01:04:12] Gerard Donnelly: He's good.
[01:04:12] Abby Jorgensen: He's getting pretty consistent with everything.
[01:04:18] Abby Jorgensen: I still don't understand.
[01:04:20] Abby Jorgensen: like, during his Tuesday session, he was like, the trainer didn't take over.
[01:04:25] Abby Jorgensen: Like, he did that how it was supposed to.
[01:04:29] Abby Jorgensen: He said the second he started the FTP, he could feel the trainer take over.
[01:04:36] Gerard Donnelly: Yeah.
[01:04:37] Gerard Donnelly: So that's it.
[01:04:40] Gerard Donnelly: So, yeah.
[01:04:41] Abby Jorgensen: And then, so I was like, that's fine.
[01:04:44] Abby Jorgensen: Let's just do a block of training.
[01:04:46] Abby Jorgensen: Hopefully, we figure out why the trainer is taking over for just the FTP test.
[01:04:52] Abby Jorgensen: I don't know why.
[01:04:57] Gerard Donnelly: No, I'd say.
[01:04:58] Gerard Donnelly: don't don't know.
[01:04:59] Gerard Donnelly: fine.
[01:05:00] Gerard Donnelly: That's him.
[01:05:02] Gerard Donnelly: Would you?
[01:05:04] Gerard Donnelly: This is all ergo.
[01:05:06] Gerard Donnelly: Yeah.
[01:05:08] Gerard Donnelly: And that's not.
[01:05:09] Gerard Donnelly: I don't know.
[01:05:09] Abby Jorgensen: He said he felt like the trainers started to take over.
[01:05:15] Gerard Donnelly: Oh, what the hell?
[01:05:20] Gerard Donnelly: I was only doing eight minutes.
[01:05:22] Gerard Donnelly: What's going on?
[01:05:26] Gerard Donnelly: So he only did eight minutes.
[01:05:27] Gerard Donnelly: Yeah.
[01:05:28] Gerard Donnelly: Because he said that he, the trainer took over.
[01:05:30] Abby Jorgensen: So he didn't want to do the same thing that happened last time when the trainer took over.
[01:05:36] Gerard Donnelly: So he needs to do that again, Abby.
[01:05:40] Gerard Donnelly: Don't do another training block.
[01:05:41] Gerard Donnelly: Don't do any training without him doing another test.
[01:05:44] Gerard Donnelly: He needs to do it again.
[01:05:46] Gerard Donnelly: Okay.
[01:05:46] Gerard Donnelly: He needs to have a practice session.
[01:05:49] Gerard Donnelly: So he's not using Zwift or anything, is he?
[01:05:55] Gerard Donnelly: Uh, no.
[01:05:58] Gerard Donnelly: So I can't figure out.
[01:06:00] Gerard Donnelly: Yeah, if he's just using the Wahoo app, the Wahoo app's totally controlling him, so get him off the Wahoo app.
[01:06:07] Gerard Donnelly: Don't have that off.
[01:06:09] Gerard Donnelly: Yeah, that's what I told him.
[01:06:10] Abby Jorgensen: Like, he said he did, so I don't know.
[01:06:15] Abby Jorgensen: If that's the power he can ride, then great.
[01:06:17] Gerard Donnelly: Just keep riding that, but do it for 20 minutes.
[01:06:21] Gerard Donnelly: That looks fine to me.
[01:06:24] Gerard Donnelly: Was he struggling, was he, with the power, with the effort?
[01:06:28] Gerard Donnelly: Like, his heart rate's only 129.
[01:06:36] Gerard Donnelly: When did he get the kicker?
[01:06:39] Abby Jorgensen: He tried the test last week.
[01:06:41] Abby Jorgensen: Yeah, this is where, so we tried it, and then I looked at it, and I was like, that's, the trainer went into the funeral of death or whatever.
[01:06:51] Gerard Donnelly: Yeah, that's right, yeah.
[01:06:53] Abby Jorgensen: So then we tried it again, and he said he felt the same thing starting to happen.
[01:06:59] Abby Jorgensen: But on this one
[01:07:00] Abby Jorgensen: And he said it didn't.
[01:07:01] Abby Jorgensen: So that's why I was confused.
[01:07:05] Gerard Donnelly: Yeah, well, don't get him to do it again.
[01:07:07] Abby Jorgensen: Yeah, I was like, if you're hitting these numbers, we'll just go with it.
[01:07:12] Abby Jorgensen: Because we used the number from the last one just to get him a number.
[01:07:20] Abby Jorgensen: And he's aware his cadence was too high for these.
[01:07:25] Abby Jorgensen: But I was like, well, we did a session and we got it to work.
[01:07:30] Gerard Donnelly: His heart rate was 126, 133.
[01:07:33] Gerard Donnelly: And in the run, his heart rate was 137, 146.
[01:07:38] Gerard Donnelly: So it's not stressing him that much, these efforts.
[01:07:46] Gerard Donnelly: So I would be, if we're not going to test him, Abby, I would be changing his FTP up a little bit.
[01:07:54] Gerard Donnelly: Okay.
[01:07:55] Gerard Donnelly: Because that, you know, when he's running, he can get a heart rate of 146.
[01:07:59] Gerard Donnelly: His average is 146.
[01:07:59] Gerard Donnelly: So
[01:08:02] Gerard Donnelly: He's average in this is 126, so that's like 11 beats lower.
[01:08:11] Gerard Donnelly: And he's at 93 RPM, so it'll actually be lower if he rides lower cadence.
[01:08:19] Gerard Donnelly: What's it set at?
[01:08:24] Abby Jorgensen: 150 something, maybe?
[01:08:26] Abby Jorgensen: 154.
[01:08:27] Abby Jorgensen: 150.
[01:08:30] Gerard Donnelly: And what was he doing in those five minute effects?
[01:08:32] Gerard Donnelly: No, there's one.
[01:08:47] Gerard Donnelly: 147, that's okay.
[01:08:53] Abby Jorgensen: And he was holding that 180 in that test before the.
[01:08:57] Abby Jorgensen: Yes.
[01:08:58] Abby Jorgensen: Bye, Roland.
[01:08:59] Gerard Donnelly: Bye,
[01:09:00] Gerard Donnelly: Yeah, I think, maybe just bump it up a little bit.
[01:09:06] Gerard Donnelly: Yeah.
[01:09:07] Gerard Donnelly: Maybe 160.
[01:09:09] Gerard Donnelly: 160.
[01:09:17] Gerard Donnelly: Okay.
[01:09:19] Gerard Donnelly: See how it goes with that.
[01:09:21] Gerard Donnelly: Okay.
[01:09:21] Abby Jorgensen: He'll have his first 30-15 session too, so really kind of see where.
[01:09:27] Gerard Donnelly: Yeah.
[01:09:30] Gerard Donnelly: So now he's riding 150 to 160, so that'll be all right.
[01:09:34] Gerard Donnelly: Good.
[01:09:36] Gerard Donnelly: All right.
[01:09:37] Gerard Donnelly: Running-wise, he's going all right?
[01:09:39] Gerard Donnelly: Yeah.
[01:09:41] Abby Jorgensen: He missed one run Friday.
[01:09:45] Abby Jorgensen: But other than that, he's gotten pretty consistent, so.
[01:09:55] Abby Jorgensen: Okay.
[01:09:56] Abby Jorgensen: Good.
[01:09:57] Gerard Donnelly: It's the swimming that I worry about, but.
[01:10:06] Gerard Donnelly: We have time, though.
[01:10:07] Gerard Donnelly: July is his race, so.
[01:10:09] Gerard Donnelly: Yes.
[01:10:11] Gerard Donnelly: Just keep encouraging him.
[01:10:17] Gerard Donnelly: He's using the pool buoy, is he?
[01:10:19] Gerard Donnelly: A little bit, yeah.
[01:10:26] Gerard Donnelly: He's getting to alternate pool buoy in, pool buoy out, I think that's what you're doing anyway, isn't it?
[01:10:30] Gerard Donnelly: Yeah.
[01:10:31] Abby Jorgensen: And if you think, if he sees Mr.
[01:10:33] Gerard Donnelly: Run, you know, add another, you can't really add another run.
[01:10:40] Gerard Donnelly: Yeah, based on his schedule, too.
[01:10:44] Abby Jorgensen: It's kind of, he can run at lunchtime or has kids' sports and stuff, so.
[01:10:52] Gerard Donnelly: Yeah.
[01:10:53] Gerard Donnelly: So he couldn't do that right on a Monday?
[01:10:56] Gerard Donnelly: Would that be too difficult?
[01:10:59] Gerard Donnelly: On Monday?
[01:11:00] Abby Jorgensen: Friday, he runs Sunday.
[01:11:02] Abby Jorgensen: He could probably, he probably hasn't missed that run yet because it's, he's still two hours behind me as well.
[01:11:11] Gerard Donnelly: Yeah.
[01:11:12] Gerard Donnelly: Yes, okay.
[01:11:13] Gerard Donnelly: Yeah.
[01:11:14] Gerard Donnelly: Yeah.
[01:11:16] Gerard Donnelly: Yeah, I'm, again, it's just.
[01:11:18] Gerard Donnelly: The back-to-back running.
[01:11:20] Gerard Donnelly: He did miss Friday, so he hasn't run since Wednesday.
[01:11:24] Gerard Donnelly: Ah, sorry.
[01:11:25] Abby Jorgensen: He ran last, yesterday.
[01:11:27] Abby Jorgensen: Yep.
[01:11:29] Gerard Donnelly: Okay.
[01:11:29] Gerard Donnelly: Okay.
[01:11:30] Gerard Donnelly: So Mark's leaving, so not much we can say about that.
[01:11:34] Gerard Donnelly: It's unfortunate.
[01:11:36] Gerard Donnelly: Yep.
[01:11:36] Gerard Donnelly: So I'll just take him out of there.
[01:11:41] Gerard Donnelly: Pause.
[01:11:44] Gerard Donnelly: Disappointing.
[01:11:45] Gerard Donnelly: Hopefully he comes back.
[01:11:47] Gerard Donnelly: Yep.
[01:11:49] Gerard Donnelly: Where are we?
[01:11:50] Gerard Donnelly: Oh, all right.
[01:11:51] Gerard Donnelly: Philip.
[01:11:55] Gerard Donnelly: Mr.
[01:11:56] Gerard Donnelly: Consistency.
[01:11:57] Abby Jorgensen: Yep.
[01:11:59] Abby Jorgensen: Um, um, um, um, um, um, um, um, um, um, um
[01:12:00] Abby Jorgensen: He did have his first ride today.
[01:12:05] Abby Jorgensen: I think some of the skiing's catching up to him.
[01:12:08] Abby Jorgensen: Yes, I can.
[01:12:09] Abby Jorgensen: I was like, I told him today, I was like, I was wondering when that was going to happen.
[01:12:17] Gerard Donnelly: Took one bottle of 500 milligrams of sodium and no sugar.
[01:12:21] Gerard Donnelly: Oh.
[01:12:25] Gerard Donnelly: That's not bad.
[01:12:26] Gerard Donnelly: Yeah, I was like, could have been worse.
[01:12:28] Abby Jorgensen: I think, I think that's a good reason if they're going to start failing sessions, Abby.
[01:12:34] Gerard Donnelly: When's the last time he tested?
[01:12:36] Gerard Donnelly: He tested there not long ago, second of January.
[01:12:40] Gerard Donnelly: So, so what did he do?
[01:12:45] Gerard Donnelly: Who was it?
[01:12:46] Abby Jorgensen: He warmed up before that.
[01:12:50] Abby Jorgensen: He did 10, 10 watts more.
[01:12:54] Gerard Donnelly: And so, so he's, he should be able to do that session.
[01:12:59] Gerard Donnelly: He
[01:13:01] Gerard Donnelly: That's weird.
[01:13:02] Abby Jorgensen: He said he got behind on his nutrition over the weekend, too.
[01:13:07] Abby Jorgensen: So he told me he just didn't eat like they got out there on the mountains and didn't have enough.
[01:13:13] Abby Jorgensen: And so he thinks he just was in debt from the weekend, too.
[01:13:18] Abby Jorgensen: So I told him for the run, I was like, if you're feeling still fatigued later today when you do the run, don't do it and we'll move it around.
[01:13:28] Abby Jorgensen: And if he's fatigued, so you can run tomorrow.
[01:13:33] Gerard Donnelly: Yeah.
[01:13:35] Abby Jorgensen: All right.
[01:13:39] Gerard Donnelly: But other than that, it is normally good.
[01:13:43] Gerard Donnelly: Aaron, she we talked last week about getting her to.
[01:13:48] Gerard Donnelly: She did.
[01:13:49] Gerard Donnelly: She did find a random bike.
[01:13:52] Abby Jorgensen: She just rode for 30 minutes.
[01:13:54] Abby Jorgensen: But I guess, yeah, I could have paired that with.
[01:13:59] Abby Jorgensen: Yeah.
[01:13:59] Gerard Donnelly: It doesn't.
[01:14:00] Gerard Donnelly: Doesn't want to do it.
[01:14:01] Gerard Donnelly: I think it's because she might have added it.
[01:14:03] Abby Jorgensen: I don't know.
[01:14:04] Abby Jorgensen: There's nothing there.
[01:14:05] Gerard Donnelly: That's right.
[01:14:07] Gerard Donnelly: So we can just give her green for 30 minutes if she's done something.
[01:14:15] Abby Jorgensen: She even sent me a picture of her on the bike.
[01:14:20] Abby Jorgensen: But, yeah, last week in Australia.
[01:14:24] Gerard Donnelly: I'm surprised that she's not running.
[01:14:26] Gerard Donnelly: I mean, it's been harsh here.
[01:14:27] Abby Jorgensen: Well, she says they're doing a lot of, like, you know, sightseeing and walking and doing a whole bunch of other stuff, too.
[01:14:34] Abby Jorgensen: So.
[01:14:37] Gerard Donnelly: Yeah.
[01:14:38] Gerard Donnelly: Okay.
[01:14:38] Gerard Donnelly: We just.
[01:14:39] Gerard Donnelly: Yeah.
[01:14:40] Abby Jorgensen: She has some kind of some goals and races once she gets back.
[01:14:46] Abby Jorgensen: So at least we'll have something.
[01:14:47] Abby Jorgensen: Yeah.
[01:14:49] Abby Jorgensen: To work towards now.
[01:14:50] Abby Jorgensen: Yeah.
[01:14:51] Gerard Donnelly: It's a real pity that she hasn't really run.
[01:14:55] Gerard Donnelly: She's run 10k.
[01:14:58] Gerard Donnelly: right.
[01:14:58] Gerard Donnelly: you.
[01:15:00] Gerard Donnelly: 4K.
[01:15:01] Gerard Donnelly: Oh my God.
[01:15:02] Gerard Donnelly: It's really detrimental.
[01:15:05] Gerard Donnelly: Anyway, that's what she's done.
[01:15:09] Gerard Donnelly: Yep.
[01:15:10] Gerard Donnelly: The main man, Riley.
[01:15:14] Abby Jorgensen: He's going well, isn't he?
[01:15:16] Gerard Donnelly: Yeah.
[01:15:16] Gerard Donnelly: I mean, he was sick.
[01:15:18] Abby Jorgensen: Was it last week or two weeks ago?
[01:15:20] Abby Jorgensen: Whatever it was.
[01:15:22] Abby Jorgensen: Yep.
[01:15:22] Gerard Donnelly: Sick.
[01:15:24] Abby Jorgensen: But kind of back in the swing of things.
[01:15:28] Gerard Donnelly: Yep.
[01:15:31] Gerard Donnelly: So how did he go after his sickness with the efforts?
[01:15:36] Gerard Donnelly: I reduced the intensity on the day, which is fine.
[01:15:42] Gerard Donnelly: Yeah, he managed those.
[01:15:44] Abby Jorgensen: He still said he could feel like he was glad that they were lower.
[01:15:48] Abby Jorgensen: And then he did fine on Thursday.
[01:15:56] Gerard Donnelly: Yeah, well, right.
[01:15:57] Gerard Donnelly: Okay.
[01:15:57] Gerard Donnelly: Okay.
[01:16:00] Gerard Donnelly: Very good.
[01:16:02] Gerard Donnelly: Cadence is alright.
[01:16:05] Gerard Donnelly: Power 292.
[01:16:07] Gerard Donnelly: Good.
[01:16:08] Gerard Donnelly: Well done.
[01:16:09] Gerard Donnelly: Very good.
[01:16:11] Gerard Donnelly: And he's back running four times.
[01:16:15] Gerard Donnelly: Good.
[01:16:16] Gerard Donnelly: Alright.
[01:16:20] Gerard Donnelly: Yep.
[01:16:22] Gerard Donnelly: So run in the afternoon, steady state, run off the bike.
[01:16:26] Gerard Donnelly: Really, very good.
[01:16:27] Gerard Donnelly: That's great.
[01:16:28] Gerard Donnelly: Uh, Peter?
[01:16:31] Abby Jorgensen: Um, we finally got a good FTP out of him.
[01:16:36] Abby Jorgensen: Um.
[01:16:39] Gerard Donnelly: Uh, okay.
[01:16:41] Gerard Donnelly: So 308.
[01:16:42] Gerard Donnelly: no.
[01:16:42] Gerard Donnelly: no.
[01:16:43] Gerard Donnelly: No.
[01:16:44] Gerard Donnelly: That's, uh, I texted Marv already.
[01:16:46] Gerard Donnelly: Thank you.
[01:16:47] Gerard Donnelly: Yep.
[01:16:48] Gerard Donnelly: Yeah.
[01:16:48] Abby Jorgensen: Uh, was 2, 90 something maybe?
[01:16:57] Abby Jorgensen: 280.
[01:16:58] Abby Jorgensen: 280.
[01:17:00] Gerard Donnelly: He's executed okay, he?
[01:17:02] Gerard Donnelly: Yeah.
[01:17:04] Abby Jorgensen: Yeah.
[01:17:05] Gerard Donnelly: Well done.
[01:17:06] Gerard Donnelly: Good.
[01:17:07] Gerard Donnelly: Did he bugger up last FTP?
[01:17:10] Gerard Donnelly: Yeah.
[01:17:11] Gerard Donnelly: Yeah, he just...
[01:17:12] Gerard Donnelly: We made him do it again.
[01:17:14] Gerard Donnelly: Yeah.
[01:17:16] Gerard Donnelly: And so he ended up with 280.
[01:17:17] Gerard Donnelly: Did he end up finishing that one?
[01:17:20] Gerard Donnelly: No.
[01:17:25] Gerard Donnelly: That's a warm down, it?
[01:17:31] Abby Jorgensen: He did, like, 12 minutes, maybe?
[01:17:34] Abby Jorgensen: Yeah, at 200, 300 or something, wasn't it?
[01:17:36] Gerard Donnelly: Yeah.
[01:17:38] Gerard Donnelly: Oh.
[01:17:40] Gerard Donnelly: Oh, my God.
[01:17:46] Gerard Donnelly: 2.92, isn't he?
[01:17:50] Abby Jorgensen: Well done.
[01:17:52] Gerard Donnelly: He's like that.
[01:17:53] Gerard Donnelly: That's good.
[01:17:54] Gerard Donnelly: Yeah.
[01:17:56] Abby Jorgensen: He's doing...
[01:17:57] Gerard Donnelly: He wasn't feeling well, okay?
[01:18:00] Gerard Donnelly: Yeah, but other than that, he's kind of back on.
[01:18:04] Gerard Donnelly: So he adjusted the FTP down, yeah?
[01:18:08] Gerard Donnelly: Yep.
[01:18:08] Gerard Donnelly: Did you check?
[01:18:09] Gerard Donnelly: Yep.
[01:18:10] Gerard Donnelly: Yep.
[01:18:10] Gerard Donnelly: Great.
[01:18:11] Gerard Donnelly: Okay.
[01:18:13] Gerard Donnelly: Strength?
[01:18:14] Gerard Donnelly: Yep, good.
[01:18:17] Gerard Donnelly: So one run, two run, three run, four run.
[01:18:20] Gerard Donnelly: So he could possibly still do it.
[01:18:21] Gerard Donnelly: He's in California.
[01:18:22] Gerard Donnelly: Oh, no.
[01:18:22] Gerard Donnelly: Where is he now?
[01:18:24] Gerard Donnelly: North Carolina.
[01:18:25] Gerard Donnelly: I just talked to him, though, so he should be fine.
[01:18:28] Gerard Donnelly: Yeah.
[01:18:28] Gerard Donnelly: Yeah, just, yeah.
[01:18:32] Abby Jorgensen: He usually works out at night, usually, so.
[01:18:35] Gerard Donnelly: So you're happy with him?
[01:18:36] Abby Jorgensen: Yeah, he's definitely back on.
[01:18:39] Abby Jorgensen: Yep.
[01:18:41] Gerard Donnelly: Communicating well and all that stuff, so.
[01:18:43] Abby Jorgensen: So Dan's, how's Dan going?
[01:18:45] Gerard Donnelly: Dan's good.
[01:18:47] Abby Jorgensen: Dan's Mr.
[01:18:48] Gerard Donnelly: Consistent as well.
[01:18:49] Gerard Donnelly: He's knowing everything.
[01:18:51] Gerard Donnelly: Good.
[01:18:51] Abby Jorgensen: Why do your swims always come up yellow?
[01:18:54] Abby Jorgensen: Is it because of yards versus meters?
[01:18:56] Gerard Donnelly: No, no, no, Abby, because there's no time.
[01:18:59] Gerard Donnelly: No,
[01:19:00] Gerard Donnelly: So if you wanted to change that for someone who's really particular, that's all I would do.
[01:19:05] Gerard Donnelly: And then if you're happy with it, you know, sometimes I know someone's really  about that.
[01:19:12] Gerard Donnelly: I would go, I would be going through each week going, you know, you did, you did the session.
[01:19:18] Gerard Donnelly: So you deserve to get green.
[01:19:21] Gerard Donnelly: Yeah.
[01:19:22] Gerard Donnelly: So he's that sort of, he's that sort of personality, isn't he?
[01:19:25] Gerard Donnelly: Yeah.
[01:19:26] Gerard Donnelly: I just, yeah.
[01:19:26] Abby Jorgensen: Never understood why it would come out.
[01:19:29] Abby Jorgensen: Because our session doesn't come up.
[01:19:32] Gerard Donnelly: I don't know why it doesn't come up with the time.
[01:19:34] Gerard Donnelly: I think maybe because the drills are in there and the drills don't have time.
[01:19:38] Gerard Donnelly: Maybe.
[01:19:40] Abby Jorgensen: So I've never understood why.
[01:19:42] Gerard Donnelly: anyway.
[01:19:42] Gerard Donnelly: People ask me and I'm like, the swimming stuff confuses me.
[01:19:46] Abby Jorgensen: Yeah.
[01:19:46] Gerard Donnelly: Just say.
[01:19:47] Abby Jorgensen: Meters or yards, sometimes it throws it off as well.
[01:19:50] Gerard Donnelly: It says duration, nothing.
[01:19:52] Gerard Donnelly: And I think that's because we've got drills with nothing in it.
[01:19:57] Gerard Donnelly: I think, whereas all the rest of us have got time.
[01:19:59] Gerard Donnelly: I
[01:20:00] Gerard Donnelly: Yeah.
[01:20:01] Gerard Donnelly: So maybe.
[01:20:02] Abby Jorgensen: Like mine will come up with, when you put them in mine, sometimes it comes up with time.
[01:20:08] Gerard Donnelly: Yeah.
[01:20:09] Gerard Donnelly: I don't know.
[01:20:10] Gerard Donnelly: No, actually, I don't really know.
[01:20:12] Gerard Donnelly: I'm just guessing.
[01:20:13] Gerard Donnelly: Yeah, I was too.
[01:20:15] Gerard Donnelly: As soon as I put a time in, it fixes it.
[01:20:17] Gerard Donnelly: Yeah.
[01:20:18] Gerard Donnelly: I mean, I've done that for people because it drives me crazy too.
[01:20:22] Gerard Donnelly: Yeah.
[01:20:22] Gerard Donnelly: Some people don't worry about it.
[01:20:24] Gerard Donnelly: I don't care.
[01:20:24] Gerard Donnelly: But the people who I know are particular about having green everywhere, I'll make sure that okay.
[01:20:31] Gerard Donnelly: The worst athlete.
[01:20:32] Gerard Donnelly: Still the worst athlete.
[01:20:36] Gerard Donnelly: She's leaving soon.
[01:20:37] Gerard Donnelly: Yeah.
[01:20:38] Gerard Donnelly: Hopefully.
[01:20:39] Abby Jorgensen: Fingers crossed that when she gets back to Australia, we can get something going.
[01:20:44] Gerard Donnelly: Yeah.
[01:20:46] Gerard Donnelly: That's just horrible.
[01:20:48] Gerard Donnelly: And her mom hasn't got any problems.
[01:20:51] Abby Jorgensen: No, her mom is actually, you know, considering what her mom is going through or wasn't through.
[01:20:55] Abby Jorgensen: Like, yeah, doing well.
[01:20:59] Abby Jorgensen: They They were.
[01:20:59] Abby Jorgensen: Thank
[01:21:00] Abby Jorgensen: You've got a bet going.
[01:21:01] Gerard Donnelly: on.
[01:21:02] Gerard Donnelly: I went to her parents.
[01:21:05] Abby Jorgensen: She texted me while she was on.
[01:21:07] Abby Jorgensen: I don't understand how Vancouver, like, there's an island her parents live off of, and like, you have to take her car on the ferry to, so she was on the ferry coming back and was messaging me.
[01:21:22] Abby Jorgensen: It was weird to me, but I don't know how, geography-wise, I don't understand that.
[01:21:28] Gerard Donnelly: It's freezing up there.
[01:21:31] Gerard Donnelly: Well, not in Vancouver, it's not.
[01:21:33] Abby Jorgensen: Vancouver is western side.
[01:21:38] Abby Jorgensen: Yeah, but it's still above Seattle.
[01:21:41] Gerard Donnelly: Yeah.
[01:21:42] Gerard Donnelly: It's above you.
[01:21:43] Abby Jorgensen: No, that's way west.
[01:21:46] Abby Jorgensen: So she says, like, there are 50s, 60s all the time, maybe 70s, but we're, yeah.
[01:21:57] Abby Jorgensen: From a geography standpoint.
[01:22:07] Gerard Donnelly: So you're here.
[01:22:13] Gerard Donnelly: She's more north than you are.
[01:22:15] Gerard Donnelly: Yeah.
[01:22:17] Gerard Donnelly: So she's got cold, believe me.
[01:22:20] Gerard Donnelly: I mean, she's right next to Whistler, which is the biggest ski field in the world.
[01:22:24] Abby Jorgensen: I don't know, it's 50 and raining there right now.
[01:22:26] Abby Jorgensen: Yeah.
[01:22:28] Abby Jorgensen: So it's her cold versus my cold, I guess.
[01:22:32] Abby Jorgensen: Yeah.
[01:22:33] Gerard Donnelly: So that's different to Montreal, you know, and Toronto, which is on the other side of the country.
[01:22:39] Gerard Donnelly: I know.
[01:22:41] Abby Jorgensen: Like Albert and Blair and Philippe, they're all more over like New York.
[01:22:50] Abby Jorgensen: Yes.
[01:22:51] Gerard Donnelly: Yeah.
[01:22:52] Gerard Donnelly: Yeah.
[01:22:52] Gerard Donnelly: So, you know, it's still high up, you know.
[01:22:58] Gerard Donnelly: But anyway, that's...
[01:22:59] Gerard Donnelly: Thank you.
[01:22:59] Gerard Donnelly: Thank
[01:23:03] Gerard Donnelly: Oh, look, I'm just happy you've got her going again.
[01:23:05] Gerard Donnelly: That's great.
[01:23:07] Gerard Donnelly: Yeah.
[01:23:09] Gerard Donnelly: Yeah.
[01:23:10] Gerard Donnelly: Go on.
[01:23:11] Gerard Donnelly: What are you guys?
[01:23:14] Gerard Donnelly: What are you guys?
[01:23:15] Abby Jorgensen: Bill's good too, yeah.
[01:23:18] Abby Jorgensen: Yeah, Bill's good?
[01:23:18] Gerard Donnelly: Yep.
[01:23:27] Gerard Donnelly: He's in his last week.
[01:23:28] Gerard Donnelly: What's his race?
[01:23:30] Gerard Donnelly: May?
[01:23:31] Gerard Donnelly: Good.
[01:23:32] Gerard Donnelly: Yep.
[01:23:35] Gerard Donnelly: Okay.
[01:23:38] Gerard Donnelly: That's great.
[01:23:38] Gerard Donnelly: You get those eight-minute efforts in the 60-60s.
[01:23:41] Gerard Donnelly: That's terrific.
[01:23:42] Abby Jorgensen: Yeah, those have been helping him quite a bit.
[01:23:45] Abby Jorgensen: Good.
[01:23:47] Gerard Donnelly: Albert.
[01:23:51] Gerard Donnelly: Just in his race.
[01:23:52] Gerard Donnelly: Yeah.
[01:23:53] Abby Jorgensen: Yep.
[01:23:54] Abby Jorgensen: We just had a conversation with him today about, you know, where he's starting and all that stuff.
[01:23:59] Abby Jorgensen: Yep.
[01:24:00] Gerard Donnelly: He's in the main part of it.
[01:24:02] Gerard Donnelly: He's actually going okay with the sessions.
[01:24:04] Gerard Donnelly: Yeah.
[01:24:07] Gerard Donnelly: Considering his crazy work schedule.
[01:24:11] Abby Jorgensen: Yeah, he just started classes this week too, but he said they're all online, so he doesn't have to – it shouldn't affect his training too much.
[01:24:19] Abby Jorgensen: Yep.
[01:24:21] Gerard Donnelly: I'm just checking out his last FTP.
[01:24:24] Gerard Donnelly: So this is the second FTP for him?
[01:24:27] Gerard Donnelly: Yep.
[01:24:27] Gerard Donnelly: And do you think he deserves to be confident to be moving up?
[01:24:36] Gerard Donnelly: Yeah.
[01:24:36] Abby Jorgensen: Let's see.
[01:24:37] Abby Jorgensen: What did I tell him?
[01:24:39] Abby Jorgensen: So he did 191 last time.
[01:24:42] Gerard Donnelly: Yeah.
[01:24:43] Gerard Donnelly: So I told him to start right around.
[01:24:45] Abby Jorgensen: He wanted to start higher – or wait.
[01:24:48] Abby Jorgensen: Yeah, he wanted to start 195 to 200.
[01:24:52] Abby Jorgensen: I told him to start 191 and then feel it out.
[01:24:55] Abby Jorgensen: Okay.
[01:24:56] Gerard Donnelly: I told him to He
[01:25:08] Gerard Donnelly: Yeah, he's nailing those, isn't he?
[01:25:11] Gerard Donnelly: Yeah.
[01:25:12] Abby Jorgensen: I was like, in the first one or two minutes, if you know right out of the gate that that's all I can go, but don't suck.
[01:25:21] Gerard Donnelly: Yeah, what you just said is perfect.
[01:25:23] Gerard Donnelly: The first two or three minutes, that's...
[01:25:26] Gerard Donnelly: You'll know by then.
[01:25:35] Abby Jorgensen: I think you missed a couple of these, I remember.
[01:25:39] Abby Jorgensen: But I think sometimes it comes down to that first one, just finding the right deer.
[01:25:44] Gerard Donnelly: No, he's fine.
[01:25:45] Gerard Donnelly: Yeah.
[01:25:46] Gerard Donnelly: Good.
[01:25:47] Gerard Donnelly: He should be good.
[01:25:49] Gerard Donnelly: And Scott?
[01:25:49] Abby Jorgensen: concern was...
[01:25:51] Abby Jorgensen: So if you look at...
[01:25:52] Abby Jorgensen: I just wanted to...
[01:25:53] Abby Jorgensen: Yeah, Albert.
[01:25:54] Abby Jorgensen: If you look at Sunday...
[01:25:56] Abby Jorgensen: Yes.
[01:25:57] Abby Jorgensen: Because he runs on...
[01:25:58] Gerard Donnelly: He runs on...
[01:26:00] Abby Jorgensen: This next Sunday, he runs on those, the salt runner, those slated treadmills.
[01:26:05] Abby Jorgensen: Oh, yes.
[01:26:07] Gerard Donnelly: He was kind of worried about a 10K on it.
[01:26:10] Abby Jorgensen: So I took out, I put him on the bike, kind of like you did with me, just a warm up.
[01:26:16] Abby Jorgensen: So he's not spending cold and icy there.
[01:26:21] Abby Jorgensen: So, um, yep.
[01:26:25] Gerard Donnelly: Where's he?
[01:26:29] Abby Jorgensen: He's, uh, somewhere in Canada.
[01:26:32] Gerard Donnelly: So the colder parts of Canada.
[01:26:34] Gerard Donnelly: He's in Montreal, I think, isn't he?
[01:26:36] Gerard Donnelly: Yeah.
[01:26:36] Abby Jorgensen: It's, he's icy and snowy there.
[01:26:39] Abby Jorgensen: Yeah.
[01:26:39] Gerard Donnelly: So, so getting to do it on the treadmill.
[01:26:42] Gerard Donnelly: Yeah.
[01:26:43] Gerard Donnelly: Yep.
[01:26:43] Gerard Donnelly: That's, he said, I asked him if he can go outside.
[01:26:45] Abby Jorgensen: He's like, yeah, probably not.
[01:26:47] Abby Jorgensen: I think he sent me the weather.
[01:26:49] Abby Jorgensen: And was like.
[01:26:51] Gerard Donnelly: But.
[01:26:52] Gerard Donnelly: Yeah.
[01:26:53] Gerard Donnelly: Yeah.
[01:26:54] Gerard Donnelly: Even, Abby, even if you wanted to, uh, you know.
[01:26:59] Gerard Donnelly: I, I, I
[01:27:00] Gerard Donnelly: Push his run to Thursday, if you wanted to, and we can do the swim next Monday.
[01:27:07] Gerard Donnelly: Okay.
[01:27:08] Gerard Donnelly: If you, you know, ask him if there's a better day with weather.
[01:27:22] Abby Jorgensen: No, negative 13 degrees Celsius.
[01:27:25] Gerard Donnelly: Yeah.
[01:27:26] Gerard Donnelly: What is it on Sunday?
[01:27:28] Abby Jorgensen: Negative 13, and then Thursday is negative 13, and chance of snow and rain.
[01:27:32] Abby Jorgensen: Yeah, forget it.
[01:27:33] Abby Jorgensen: It doesn't matter.
[01:27:34] Gerard Donnelly: Yeah, whole week.
[01:27:35] Gerard Donnelly: It's not good.
[01:27:37] Gerard Donnelly: I thought my weather was bad.
[01:27:39] Gerard Donnelly: That's cold.
[01:27:41] Abby Jorgensen: Okay.
[01:27:42] Gerard Donnelly: Scott is the biggest worry.
[01:27:45] Abby Jorgensen: Yeah, but he's, I feel like he's doing really well, especially even while he was traveling.
[01:27:53] Abby Jorgensen: That's great.
[01:27:54] Gerard Donnelly: did everything.
[01:27:58] Abby Jorgensen: So, yeah, he was on.
[01:28:00] Abby Jorgensen: He was on a Peloton, so he was looking at power, but he knew that it wasn't probably close, but he just used all PE.
[01:28:09] Gerard Donnelly: Yeah, that's good.
[01:28:11] Abby Jorgensen: Still was able to get everything in.
[01:28:20] Gerard Donnelly: Yeah, okay.
[01:28:27] Gerard Donnelly: And he's back.
[01:28:29] Gerard Donnelly: Yep.
[01:28:34] Abby Jorgensen: We're trying to figure out, because he has the Wahoo Kicker, has the Wahoo Snap, but he has his, the Kicker is on one of the virtual, the COG mode, or he has a COG, he doesn't have cassette.
[01:28:49] Gerard Donnelly: Yeah.
[01:28:50] Abby Jorgensen: So he's trying to figure out the virtual gearing versus everything.
[01:28:57] Abby Jorgensen: Yeah.
[01:28:57] Abby Jorgensen: Yeah.
[01:28:58] Abby Jorgensen: So.
[01:28:59] Abby Jorgensen: So.
[01:28:59] Abby Jorgensen: So.
[01:29:09] Gerard Donnelly: So get him off smoothing.
[01:29:18] Gerard Donnelly: Oh, yeah, it's turned it off.
[01:29:19] Gerard Donnelly: Great.
[01:29:23] Gerard Donnelly: All right, well.
[01:29:25] Abby Jorgensen: Yeah, we're just trying to because it with that cog, it just like jumps up the gearing so weird that it yeah messes him up a little bit like bikes, but the cassette is the best way to train.
[01:29:40] Gerard Donnelly: Yeah, that's what I told him.
[01:29:41] Abby Jorgensen: He said he could switch it out or he could just go to the snap and gear itself.
[01:29:47] Abby Jorgensen: So he's going to try like all different methods and see which one works best.
[01:29:50] Gerard Donnelly: Yeah, well, what the main thing, Abby, is whatever's going to happen on race day.
[01:29:56] Gerard Donnelly: That's what you should be doing in training.
[01:29:58] Gerard Donnelly: Yep.
[01:29:59] Abby Jorgensen: And we don't have a.
[01:30:00] Abby Jorgensen: Cog on race day.
[01:30:01] Gerard Donnelly: So that would be for me is, you know, the Cog, got the stupid buttons on your, you know, just use your, just get the cassette on, use your gears, you know, just replicate race day.
[01:30:19] Gerard Donnelly: Uh, I'm really pleased with, cause he was, he was felt that he wasn't being heard by his other coach.
[01:30:26] Gerard Donnelly: Uh, you know, fatigue was massive for him.
[01:30:30] Gerard Donnelly: He was just, so you just keep, keep doing the way you're doing it.
[01:30:34] Gerard Donnelly: So.
[01:30:34] Gerard Donnelly: Yeah.
[01:30:35] Abby Jorgensen: I only added like one day, like a double day, one double day because of schedule.
[01:30:42] Gerard Donnelly: Yes.
[01:30:42] Gerard Donnelly: It should be fine.
[01:30:44] Abby Jorgensen: swim run should be.
[01:30:46] Abby Jorgensen: Yep.
[01:30:47] Gerard Donnelly: And just keep asking him, let me know how your fatigue is.
[01:30:49] Gerard Donnelly: Are you getting enough sleep?
[01:30:50] Gerard Donnelly: Are you getting enough fuel?
[01:30:52] Gerard Donnelly: Um, and you know, and say those words, I will adjust your program if I feel you're getting too tired.
[01:31:00] Gerard Donnelly: Scott, but you need to tell me.
[01:31:04] Gerard Donnelly: Don't stay so long.
[01:31:07] Gerard Donnelly: Okay.
[01:31:08] Gerard Donnelly: Anything else on anybody else?
[01:31:10] Gerard Donnelly: I don't think so.
[01:31:12] Abby Jorgensen: You're okay with your own program for this week?
[01:31:14] Gerard Donnelly: Yeah.
[01:31:15] Gerard Donnelly: Yeah, it should work fine.
[01:31:17] Abby Jorgensen: I mean, my hamstrings and ankles were a little stiff this morning, but after the run, but I'm also, I feel like, well, I am 44.
[01:31:32] Abby Jorgensen: Are you looking for a sauna?
[01:31:34] Gerard Donnelly: I am.
[01:31:35] Gerard Donnelly: Yeah.
[01:31:36] Gerard Donnelly: Yeah.
[01:31:36] Gerard Donnelly: They're great.
[01:31:38] Abby Jorgensen: Yeah.
[01:31:39] Gerard Donnelly: We're actually going to try and see if we can get someone from the sauna industry to sponsor us.
[01:31:45] Gerard Donnelly: That'd be nice.
[01:31:47] Gerard Donnelly: And try and push, push some, a company to athlete.
[01:31:51] Gerard Donnelly: So.
[01:31:53] Gerard Donnelly: Yeah.
[01:31:54] Abby Jorgensen: My best friend has, like, one of the outdoor ones that gets to, like, 195.
[01:32:00] Abby Jorgensen: Oh, wow.
[01:32:02] Gerard Donnelly: Yeah.
[01:32:02] Gerard Donnelly: Yeah.
[01:32:03] Abby Jorgensen: But I was looking into like just a single person one for the house.
[01:32:08] Abby Jorgensen: Yes.
[01:32:09] Abby Jorgensen: Like 150 infrared.
[01:32:13] Abby Jorgensen: So.
[01:32:14] Gerard Donnelly: Yeah.
[01:32:14] Gerard Donnelly: Have you done much research on the difference between the hot coals and the infrared?
[01:32:17] Abby Jorgensen: I mean, the hot coals get, it gets hot a lot.
[01:32:22] Gerard Donnelly: It takes longer.
[01:32:23] Gerard Donnelly: Yeah.
[01:32:24] Abby Jorgensen: You can do steam with it because you can throw water on it.
[01:32:29] Abby Jorgensen: Infrared is supposed to heat you up from the inside faster or something, but it doesn't get as hot.
[01:32:37] Abby Jorgensen: So like some of the research is saying what 170, 165 is optimal, but I don't know.
[01:32:43] Abby Jorgensen: I mean, I think as long as you sweat and get that adaptation.
[01:32:48] Gerard Donnelly: Yeah.
[01:32:49] Gerard Donnelly: I've got a little portable one, Abby, that costs $200 and it's only a little square, it's sort of plastic and you sit with your head out and you just...
[01:32:59] Gerard Donnelly: Okay.
[01:32:59] Gerard Donnelly: All right.
[01:33:00] Gerard Donnelly: It looks weird, but that certainly cooks you, cooks your body, but yeah, yeah, so, anything else?
[01:33:16] Abby Jorgensen: Nope, I think that's, that's it, did that one guy ever, did you interview any?
[01:33:21] Gerard Donnelly: Nope, nope, I'm still waiting, I'm about to send Floyd in a question on how, what's his name?
[01:33:35] Gerard Donnelly: I can't remember him.
[01:33:37] Gerard Donnelly: Adam Tanvis, so, yeah, I'll get Floyd to follow up on him.
[01:33:47] Gerard Donnelly: Okay.
[01:33:49] Gerard Donnelly: But someone's just applied, literally, like, this morning.
[01:33:53] Gerard Donnelly: Okay.
[01:33:54] Gerard Donnelly: From the US.
[01:33:57] Gerard Donnelly: Let me read it.
[01:33:58] Gerard Donnelly: Libby.
[01:34:00] Gerard Donnelly: Libby, I've listened to the podcast.
[01:34:02] Gerard Donnelly: I really like the way you talk about your clients and your approach to triathlon.
[01:34:08] Gerard Donnelly: I'm interested in coach for triathlon.
[01:34:09] Gerard Donnelly: My big goal is the T100 World Champs in Qatar.
[01:34:14] Gerard Donnelly: I've already made the selection for Dubai.
[01:34:16] Gerard Donnelly: I've deferred it to 26.
[01:34:18] Gerard Donnelly: My big limiter is my bike.
[01:34:21] Gerard Donnelly: I had a coach for about three months last year.
[01:34:23] Gerard Donnelly: was not a good fit.
[01:34:24] Gerard Donnelly: The main issue was communication and inability to adapt my life.
[01:34:27] Gerard Donnelly: I travel a bit for work.
[01:34:29] Gerard Donnelly: Also, I didn't feel like I was being heard when I thought the plan was too challenging or completely too easy.
[01:34:38] Gerard Donnelly: A bit more detail.
[01:34:40] Gerard Donnelly: I live in Hong Kong.
[01:34:41] Gerard Donnelly: Sorry, she doesn't live in the US.
[01:34:45] Gerard Donnelly: I did four hours.
[01:34:47] Gerard Donnelly: I did Swim 148 per 100.
[01:34:49] Gerard Donnelly: Bike was 32 average, which is 20 miles an hour.
[01:34:54] Gerard Donnelly: And 439.
[01:34:55] Gerard Donnelly: What's that?
[01:34:57] Gerard Donnelly: Six minute cake.
[01:34:59] Gerard Donnelly: Run is stronger.
[01:35:00] Gerard Donnelly: Yes, but I died in the heat in Dubai.
[01:35:02] Gerard Donnelly: Swim, I do squad.
[01:35:03] Gerard Donnelly: Can I keep doing that?
[01:35:05] Gerard Donnelly: I really need a bike and run coach.
[01:35:08] Gerard Donnelly: Yeah, I would definitely give her to you, Abby.
[01:35:12] Gerard Donnelly: What is Hong Kong?
[01:35:14] Abby Jorgensen: I'm trying to think.
[01:35:15] Gerard Donnelly: Time zone.
[01:35:19] Gerard Donnelly: I've got the time zone up here somewhere.
[01:35:21] Gerard Donnelly: is it?
[01:35:22] Gerard Donnelly: Time.
[01:35:22] Gerard Donnelly: There you go.
[01:35:24] Gerard Donnelly: Hong Kong.
[01:35:27] Gerard Donnelly: Hong Kong.
[01:35:30] Gerard Donnelly: Right, Hong Kong, it's 3.30 on Sunday.
[01:35:35] Gerard Donnelly: don't know, so.
[01:35:39] Gerard Donnelly: For me now, it's 7.30.
[01:35:44] Gerard Donnelly: It's 10.30.
[01:35:49] Gerard Donnelly: It's.15 in Hong Kong right now on.
[01:35:57] Gerard Donnelly: Is that right?
[01:35:58] Gerard Donnelly: No, 7.30..00.
[01:35:59] Gerard Donnelly: Anywhere 7.30.
[01:36:00] Gerard Donnelly: 22.
[01:36:01] Gerard Donnelly: Totally wrong.
[01:36:01] Gerard Donnelly: Sorry.
[01:36:02] Gerard Donnelly: He's in the same time zone as Glenn.
[01:36:05] Abby Jorgensen: Yeah.
[01:36:06] Gerard Donnelly: It's 7.30 a.m.
[01:36:07] Gerard Donnelly: Is what you just said?
[01:36:08] Gerard Donnelly: Yeah.
[01:36:09] Gerard Donnelly: Yeah.
[01:36:11] Abby Jorgensen: That's an easy one.
[01:36:13] Gerard Donnelly: 7.30.
[01:36:14] Gerard Donnelly: And what are you now?
[01:36:15] Gerard Donnelly: You're?
[01:36:16] Abby Jorgensen: 5.30.
[01:36:18] Abby Jorgensen: Yeah.
[01:36:20] Gerard Donnelly: So that would be a good time zone.
[01:36:22] Gerard Donnelly: So you're.
[01:36:23] Gerard Donnelly: Yeah.
[01:36:23] Abby Jorgensen: mean, we found one that's not doable yet.
[01:36:27] Gerard Donnelly: Yeah.
[01:36:28] Gerard Donnelly: That's good.
[01:36:28] Gerard Donnelly: I think New Zealand is the biggest one.
[01:36:33] Abby Jorgensen: They're 19 hours ahead.
[01:36:35] Abby Jorgensen: Yeah.
[01:36:36] Gerard Donnelly: He's there right on the meridian that goes 24 hours and New Zealand starts at zero.
[01:36:43] Gerard Donnelly: The time clock starts at zero at New Zealand.
[01:36:48] Gerard Donnelly: So they're the first ones for the new year and then Australia and then the rest.
[01:36:55] Gerard Donnelly: Yeah.
[01:36:55] Abby Jorgensen: Because Michaela wished me happy new year.
[01:36:57] Abby Jorgensen: And I was like, I gave her.
[01:37:00] Abby Jorgensen: crap, because I was like, well, I'm still in the back, in the, you're way ahead of me.
[01:37:10] Gerard Donnelly: All right, well, I'll see how we go with whatever her name was, Libby.
[01:37:15] Gerard Donnelly: Maybe she's American living there?
[01:37:17] Abby Jorgensen: I don't know, it's an American name, so it sounds like it.
[01:37:19] Gerard Donnelly: Libby Humphrey, yeah.
[01:37:22] Gerard Donnelly: She must travel a I live in, actually, I live in Hong Kong, the summer here is very hot and humid, so any training from May to August particularly needs to be cleverly thought through to account for these conditions, albeit as helpful for the hot events to prepare for heat.
[01:37:36] Gerard Donnelly: I can share more details over email I'd like to discuss.
[01:37:39] Gerard Donnelly: If you have the capacity for more athletes, thank you.
[01:37:41] Gerard Donnelly: So that's a good, that's a good application.
[01:37:43] Gerard Donnelly: Okay.
[01:37:44] Abby Jorgensen: So let's, let's get her going your way.
[01:37:47] Gerard Donnelly: Yeah.
[01:37:48] Gerard Donnelly: Hopefully I'll interview her in the next couple of days, just that would replace Mark straight away.
[01:37:52] Gerard Donnelly: Yeah.
[01:37:53] Gerard Donnelly: Yeah, that was one, because I, yeah.
[01:37:56] Abby Jorgensen: Mark, he was a good guy.
[01:37:58] Abby Jorgensen: I just, I feel sorry for her.
[01:38:01] Gerard Donnelly: And you just keep in contact with him every week or two.
[01:38:05] Gerard Donnelly: Just say, hey, how are you doing?
[01:38:06] Gerard Donnelly: Just reach out.
[01:38:07] Abby Jorgensen: That's what I told him and told him I'd reach out.
[01:38:10] Abby Jorgensen: And he's like, yeah, he's like, you've been great.
[01:38:13] Abby Jorgensen: It's not obviously your fault that all this happened.
[01:38:17] Abby Jorgensen: Yeah, that's fine.
[01:38:19] Gerard Donnelly: Yeah.
[01:38:20] Gerard Donnelly: OK, great stuff.
[01:38:21] Gerard Donnelly: Well done, Abby.
[01:38:22] Gerard Donnelly: OK, thank you.
[01:38:24] Abby Jorgensen: Talk to you.
[01:38:24] Abby Jorgensen: Have a good week.
[01:38:25] Gerard Donnelly: See you.
[01:38:26] Gerard Donnelly: Bye.
[01:38:30] Gerard Donnelly: Bye.
