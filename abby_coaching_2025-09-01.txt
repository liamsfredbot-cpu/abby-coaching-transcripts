## Transcript

[00:00:00] Abby Jorgensen: Sorry, well done, well done for jumping on.
[00:00:05] Gerard Donnelly: I'll try not to hold you up.
[00:00:10] Gerard Donnelly: So, how did today go with the classic thunderstorm?
[00:00:21] Abby Jorgensen: Yeah, mean, it started a downpour on me, as usual.
[00:00:33] Abby Jorgensen: So, like the first 10 miles I was doing good and then it started a downpour and then I kind of made the call not to push it and didn't want to hydroplane in fall or anything like that.
[00:00:48] Abby Jorgensen: So, how are you feeling?
[00:00:51] Gerard Donnelly: I was okay.
[00:00:53] Abby Jorgensen: I think I might have started a little too hot.
[00:00:55] Abby Jorgensen: Like my heart rate's been high the last couple of days.
[00:00:57] Abby Jorgensen: Yeah.
[00:00:58] Abby Jorgensen: And I don't know why.
[00:00:59] Abby Jorgensen: I'm sorry.
[00:00:59] Abby Jorgensen: I'm
[00:01:00] Abby Jorgensen: I mean, it could be actually, you know, female things, hormones and stuff.
[00:01:04] Abby Jorgensen: A little out of whack right now, but.
[00:01:08] Gerard Donnelly: Has you, we never talked about this.
[00:01:10] Gerard Donnelly: Has your period been constant and normal all the time?
[00:01:14] Gerard Donnelly: No, because I'm perimenopausal.
[00:01:16] Abby Jorgensen: So it has its moments of, yeah, not exactly normal.
[00:01:24] Abby Jorgensen: Yeah.
[00:01:24] Gerard Donnelly: Okay.
[00:01:25] Gerard Donnelly: You're not coming down with anything for your heart rate to be.
[00:01:28] Gerard Donnelly: Oh, yeah.
[00:01:28] Gerard Donnelly: No, I feel fine.
[00:01:29] Abby Jorgensen: It's just, I know that when my heart rate gets high like this, it's usually hormones.
[00:01:36] Abby Jorgensen: Yeah.
[00:01:36] Abby Jorgensen: Okay.
[00:01:38] Gerard Donnelly: Well, you're obviously doing a good job managing it.
[00:01:40] Gerard Donnelly: So.
[00:01:41] Gerard Donnelly: Yeah, I try.
[00:01:43] Gerard Donnelly: I think, I think when we.
[00:01:46] Gerard Donnelly: How are you feeling?
[00:01:48] Gerard Donnelly: If I can get this thing to work.
[00:01:50] Gerard Donnelly: Not good.
[00:01:51] Gerard Donnelly: I think I'll close that one.
[00:01:55] Gerard Donnelly: Oh, my computer's frozen.
[00:01:58] Gerard Donnelly: Oh, my Oh,
[00:02:01] Gerard Donnelly: I don't know what's going on.
[00:02:04] Gerard Donnelly: That's frustrating.
[00:02:05] Gerard Donnelly: We'll try again.
[00:02:08] Gerard Donnelly: Okay.
[00:02:15] Gerard Donnelly: Sorry.
[00:02:17] Gerard Donnelly: You're fine.
[00:02:23] Gerard Donnelly: There you go.
[00:02:26] Gerard Donnelly: Yeah, it's a little bit hazy at the moment.
[00:02:29] Gerard Donnelly: I've just come out of hospital, so.
[00:02:34] Gerard Donnelly: But I'm glad I didn't do the open heart surgery and took the stent option.
[00:02:43] Gerard Donnelly: Abby, let's see.
[00:02:52] Gerard Donnelly: All right, share.
[00:02:54] Gerard Donnelly: Try again.
[00:02:57] Gerard Donnelly: All right.
[00:02:58] Gerard Donnelly: All right.
[00:02:59] Gerard Donnelly: All right.
[00:02:59] Gerard Donnelly: All right.
[00:03:00] Gerard Donnelly: All
[00:03:00] Gerard Donnelly: Okay, now we're back where we were.
[00:03:04] Gerard Donnelly: So, do you, like, most of the sessions you've been doing, you've been able to hold, you know, that one, I suppose, over those two long rides, you're able to hold around that 130 watts.
[00:03:17] Gerard Donnelly: And then, so, with normal 60 minutes, you've been able to hold around that 170 to 180, the 60 minutes.
[00:03:32] Gerard Donnelly: So, I'm sure you were pretty motivated to see what you could do, and you might have been riding a little bit too hard, which is what I was trying to get to at the start.
[00:03:43] Gerard Donnelly: So, the first effort was fantastic, you know, in those 20 plus miles an hour at 179.
[00:03:52] Gerard Donnelly: So, yeah, that could send your heart rate, you know, right out of the box.
[00:04:00] Gerard Donnelly: Right on.
[00:04:03] Gerard Donnelly: So in hindsight, it might have been a little bit too high.
[00:04:07] Gerard Donnelly: So I had you at 179, then 171, then 155, then 164.
[00:04:12] Gerard Donnelly: That's obviously where it was raining here.
[00:04:15] Abby Jorgensen: Yeah, like the two last ones, it was raining.
[00:04:19] Abby Jorgensen: Yeah, but it was okay here.
[00:04:22] Gerard Donnelly: Yeah.
[00:04:23] Gerard Donnelly: Yeah.
[00:04:24] Gerard Donnelly: So your second one, you dropped the power down because you realized you're a bit too hot, was it?
[00:04:29] Gerard Donnelly: Yeah.
[00:04:31] Gerard Donnelly: And you didn't drop by much.
[00:04:33] Gerard Donnelly: went to 171, and then obviously we didn't get to see if you can sustain that.
[00:04:40] Gerard Donnelly: And because you were turning and getting the rest, you know, if you're coaching, that's kind of what you don't.
[00:04:48] Gerard Donnelly: This stage of the program, this is exactly what we don't want to have happen is having the rest.
[00:04:56] Gerard Donnelly: Because we're trying to see what you can do with no rest for 60 minutes.
[00:04:59] Gerard Donnelly: program.
[00:04:59] Gerard Donnelly: program, star.
[00:04:59] Gerard Donnelly: do is the together.
[00:04:59] Gerard Donnelly: if We'll I
[00:05:02] Gerard Donnelly: I'm sure you knew that, but...
[00:05:04] Abby Jorgensen: Yeah, was like, it started raining, I was trying to decide what I wanted to do.
[00:05:08] Gerard Donnelly: Was it raining here when you turned?
[00:05:11] Abby Jorgensen: No, but that's just like a, there's no like good U-turn, so I have to like stop and...
[00:05:16] Abby Jorgensen: Wait for the traffic?
[00:05:18] Abby Jorgensen: Yeah, like turn my bike around and...
[00:05:21] Abby Jorgensen: Yeah, okay.
[00:05:21] Abby Jorgensen: So it's not that long.
[00:05:22] Gerard Donnelly: It's only 43 seconds, isn't it?
[00:05:25] Gerard Donnelly: Yeah.
[00:05:25] Gerard Donnelly: Yeah, okay.
[00:05:28] Gerard Donnelly: But that's okay.
[00:05:30] Gerard Donnelly: But you know, you understand how...
[00:05:32] Gerard Donnelly: As a coach, you understand how every time you stop, you're getting recovery.
[00:05:37] Gerard Donnelly: You're not accumulating the fatigue.
[00:05:40] Gerard Donnelly: So, but that's quite okay.
[00:05:45] Gerard Donnelly: So the question is, is that good enough test or do we need to do that again?
[00:05:51] Gerard Donnelly: That's the question that we need to ask.
[00:05:54] Gerard Donnelly: And you know, when we look back at your previous...
[00:06:01] Gerard Donnelly: Sessions where you've done the 160 in your road, 132 normalised, 129 average, you know, how comfortable was that?
[00:06:09] Gerard Donnelly: Is that the number you think you can sustain?
[00:06:11] Gerard Donnelly: Because we're trying to get clarification from that 60-minuter.
[00:06:14] Gerard Donnelly: That's actually what we're trying to do.
[00:06:16] Gerard Donnelly: And we're trying to see whether that's the form you're in.
[00:06:21] Gerard Donnelly: And so, yeah, it's really, you know, I wouldn't be asking an athlete this question.
[00:06:27] Gerard Donnelly: And I'd be saying, you know, well, look, we've missed on doing the 60-minute properly.
[00:06:32] Gerard Donnelly: We should probably do it again.
[00:06:34] Gerard Donnelly: But this close to an Ironman, it's not ideal.
[00:06:38] Gerard Donnelly: So we have to go with the data we've got.
[00:06:44] Gerard Donnelly: And, you to be fair, you did a 60-minuter literally four weeks ago.
[00:06:48] Gerard Donnelly: So where was it?
[00:06:51] Abby Jorgensen: I don't even think it was that long ago.
[00:06:53] Abby Jorgensen: Yeah.
[00:06:57] Gerard Donnelly: Just let me me look.
[00:07:02] Gerard Donnelly: Where was it, I've got a spreadsheet, 14th of August, that's long ago is it, that's July.
[00:07:29] Gerard Donnelly: There it is, got it.
[00:07:35] Gerard Donnelly: So I think you did 179 that day I think, was it?
[00:07:39] Gerard Donnelly: 180 or 79.
[00:07:43] Gerard Donnelly: Normalised 178, average 179.
[00:07:48] Gerard Donnelly: Yeah, so that wasn't that long ago, literally, you know, three weeks.
[00:07:55] Gerard Donnelly: So, do you feel like...
[00:08:00] Gerard Donnelly: You're sort of in – did it feel harder or easier?
[00:08:03] Gerard Donnelly: So you started lower, the 174 last time, and this time you're at 180, 179.
[00:08:11] Gerard Donnelly: So, yeah, give me some feedback.
[00:08:15] Abby Jorgensen: I mean, that one felt a lot better than today.
[00:08:22] Abby Jorgensen: So, I mean, I felt like I should have been able to hold that.
[00:08:31] Abby Jorgensen: When I've been riding for that one.
[00:08:35] Abby Jorgensen: So today I was like, well, I did 179 last time.
[00:08:38] Abby Jorgensen: So that was kind of where I wanted to start.
[00:08:41] Gerard Donnelly: Yep.
[00:08:43] Abby Jorgensen: And then, like, I felt my heart rate spike right away.
[00:08:47] Abby Jorgensen: Yes, okay.
[00:08:49] Gerard Donnelly: How hot was it today?
[00:08:52] Abby Jorgensen: What's that?
[00:08:53] Abby Jorgensen: What was my heart rate?
[00:08:54] Gerard Donnelly: No, how hot was the temperature today?
[00:08:56] Gerard Donnelly: Oh, it was in the 60s.
[00:08:59] Abby Jorgensen: So it wasn't hot.
[00:09:00] Gerard Donnelly: It wasn't hot.
[00:09:01] Gerard Donnelly: Yeah, mean, a little humid, but...
[00:09:03] Gerard Donnelly: And what was it like that day?
[00:09:05] Gerard Donnelly: Can you remember the temperature?
[00:09:09] Abby Jorgensen: 20 degrees, so it's similar sickness.
[00:09:11] Abby Jorgensen: Yeah, it was an early morning, nice early morning, remember?
[00:09:15] Gerard Donnelly: Yeah, yeah.
[00:09:17] Gerard Donnelly: And you pushed really good numbers by the end, 184.
[00:09:22] Gerard Donnelly: Yeah, so we've really, you know, we're trying to work out what, you know, 65 to 75% of that number is.
[00:09:33] Gerard Donnelly: So if we took 179 from last time, you know, your high point in at 75% of 179 for the Ironman race should be 134 watts.
[00:09:47] Gerard Donnelly: And 65% is your low range, that's around 116.
[00:09:52] Gerard Donnelly: And so when we look at what you've been doing over those 160s and 180s, you've been riding around that one.
[00:10:00] Gerard Donnelly: 130, 128 to 130.
[00:10:03] Gerard Donnelly: And, you know, are you still feeling comfortable with those numbers?
[00:10:07] Gerard Donnelly: They're the things that, you know, you need to ask yourself.
[00:10:09] Abby Jorgensen: Yeah, because even when I, like, do, like, I did, like, the easy coffee rides, like, I find myself in that 110, 116 range is, like, feels really easy to me.
[00:10:21] Gerard Donnelly: Yeah, good.
[00:10:23] Gerard Donnelly: Yeah.
[00:10:24] Gerard Donnelly: Yep.
[00:10:24] Gerard Donnelly: I think the key thing about the race day is that you're really conservative early, Abby, and don't put yourself, you've still got to ride the course, you know, and because it's only one loop, isn't it?
[00:10:42] Gerard Donnelly: No, it's two loops.
[00:10:44] Gerard Donnelly: Two loops, great.
[00:10:45] Gerard Donnelly: Sorry.
[00:10:45] Gerard Donnelly: And, like, 6,000 feet.
[00:10:47] Abby Jorgensen: That's the only part I'm a little worried about.
[00:10:49] Abby Jorgensen: Yeah.
[00:10:52] Gerard Donnelly: So, So, I think, I think being super conservative and
[00:11:00] Gerard Donnelly: Ride the course a little bit, rather than riding the power.
[00:11:06] Abby Jorgensen: Yeah, I mean, what should I do on the hill?
[00:11:09] Abby Jorgensen: mean, some of them are...
[00:11:12] Gerard Donnelly: What would you do to your athlete?
[00:11:14] Gerard Donnelly: I mean, try to say, try to gear down to...
[00:11:18] Gerard Donnelly: I just don't know.
[00:11:20] Abby Jorgensen: I know there's one at like 7%.
[00:11:22] Abby Jorgensen: I don't know what my gears...
[00:11:24] Abby Jorgensen: I've never had a hill that steep here.
[00:11:28] Abby Jorgensen: So I don't know what that is going to feel like.
[00:11:35] Abby Jorgensen: We discussed this before.
[00:11:37] Gerard Donnelly: What's your gearing at the back of your cassette?
[00:11:41] Gerard Donnelly: We did go through this, didn't we, a while ago.
[00:11:44] Gerard Donnelly: I mean, I have two.
[00:11:46] Abby Jorgensen: It's like a 12 cassette, whatever that means.
[00:11:50] Gerard Donnelly: So your front chainring has two chainrings and your rear has one cassette.
[00:11:54] Gerard Donnelly: But what...
[00:11:55] Gerard Donnelly: Have you got an 1130?
[00:11:58] Gerard Donnelly: Tooth chainring.
[00:11:59] Gerard Donnelly: chainring.
[00:12:03] Gerard Donnelly: So I want you between now and, you know, the next two days to go to your rear cassette and you need to count the teeth.
[00:12:16] Gerard Donnelly: Okay.
[00:12:21] Gerard Donnelly: My bike's not here.
[00:12:24] Gerard Donnelly: It's in my wife's car.
[00:12:25] Abby Jorgensen: I've mine in to get carbon wheels and tuned up on Tuesday, so I can ask my customers what it is.
[00:12:35] Abby Jorgensen: So you can change cassettes.
[00:12:37] Gerard Donnelly: If you can afford to buy another cassette, you can change cassettes.
[00:12:41] Gerard Donnelly: They're $200 to $300, which is quite expensive, I know.
[00:12:50] Gerard Donnelly: But you can't change cassettes after you've taken it to the bike shop because the bike shop will need to tune the new cassette to your chain.
[00:12:59] Gerard Donnelly: So your chain...
[00:13:00] Gerard Donnelly: And it's got some wear in it, and it's really adapted to your cassette at the moment.
[00:13:06] Gerard Donnelly: It fits like a glove.
[00:13:07] Gerard Donnelly: The minute you change the rear cassette, your old chain won't run as smoothly because it's worn to the old cassette.
[00:13:16] Gerard Donnelly: Okay.
[00:13:17] Gerard Donnelly: You know, the teeth on the back of the cassette.
[00:13:20] Gerard Donnelly: So the chain runs through there.
[00:13:21] Gerard Donnelly: So normally when you change cassettes, you need to change chains.
[00:13:25] Gerard Donnelly: I don't know how long ago you changed your chain on your bike.
[00:13:28] Gerard Donnelly: I mean, I've only had the bike.
[00:13:30] Abby Jorgensen: This year, so.
[00:13:32] Gerard Donnelly: How long ago is that?
[00:13:34] Gerard Donnelly: Is it a whole 12 months with the one?
[00:13:36] Gerard Donnelly: It hasn't even been 12 months.
[00:13:38] Abby Jorgensen: So I got it late, late fall last year.
[00:13:43] Gerard Donnelly: Yeah.
[00:13:44] Gerard Donnelly: So a new chain should fit with a new, you know, a reasonably new chain.
[00:13:49] Gerard Donnelly: doesn't have to be brand new.
[00:13:51] Gerard Donnelly: But you would just say to your, you know, your bike shop owner, my coach is asking me, you know, if we decide to change cassettes, that's what, you know, we're not deciding.
[00:14:00] Gerard Donnelly: Okay.
[00:14:00] Gerard Donnelly: But the only way I would push you to do that is if the current cassette you have isn't good enough for Hills.
[00:14:08] Gerard Donnelly: That's the only reason we would change.
[00:14:10] Gerard Donnelly: I can ask him too.
[00:14:12] Abby Jorgensen: He has knowledge of, like, the Wisconsin horse and stuff like that as well.
[00:14:18] Gerard Donnelly: You can write this down for me.
[00:14:20] Gerard Donnelly: So I want you to take a note somewhere.
[00:14:24] Gerard Donnelly: I want you to ask him, you know, tell you what the gear ratio you have.
[00:14:32] Gerard Donnelly: So you can have the new 12-speed cassettes start with a 10 or an 11, okay?
[00:14:41] Abby Jorgensen: Okay.
[00:14:42] Abby Jorgensen: 11 or 10 teeth.
[00:14:44] Gerard Donnelly: And it goes all the way down to 28 or 30 or 32, all right?
[00:14:51] Gerard Donnelly: So I want you to find out whether you have a 10.30 or a 10.32 or a 10.28.
[00:15:00] Gerard Donnelly: Okay.
[00:15:02] Gerard Donnelly: Are you understanding what I'm actually saying?
[00:15:05] Gerard Donnelly: Because I know it's, some people, you know, the 32 is, there's 32 teeth around the cassette.
[00:15:14] Gerard Donnelly: That's all you're doing.
[00:15:16] Gerard Donnelly: There's 32.
[00:15:17] Gerard Donnelly: And as you go away from the wheel, they get smaller and smaller.
[00:15:21] Gerard Donnelly: So where the chain is, that's the smallest, which is the, that's the hardest gear to push.
[00:15:27] Gerard Donnelly: That's got 10 teeth or 11.
[00:15:30] Gerard Donnelly: And then the next one's got 11.
[00:15:32] Gerard Donnelly: The next one's got 12.
[00:15:33] Gerard Donnelly: The next one's got 13 teeth.
[00:15:35] Gerard Donnelly: Normally it would go up by one tooth all the way up to 18.
[00:15:38] Gerard Donnelly: And then it goes like 18, 21, 23, 25, 28, 30.
[00:15:43] Gerard Donnelly: So it jumps.
[00:15:46] Gerard Donnelly: So in the olden days, we had cassettes that only had five options, you know, so that was like a five speed.
[00:15:53] Gerard Donnelly: And now we've got 12 options.
[00:15:56] Gerard Donnelly: So it's a 12 speed bike.
[00:15:58] Gerard Donnelly: So that means we've got 12.
[00:16:00] Gerard Donnelly: now we've 12.
[00:16:00] Gerard Donnelly: And
[00:16:01] Gerard Donnelly: 12 individual cassettes on the rear, all right, so the important thing is that if you've got a really narrow block, and the rear cassette is called a block, and if you've got a really narrow one, you can get a 10-21, which is just a straight block, like 10-11-12-13-14-15-16-17-18-19-20, 21, with no gaps.
[00:16:26] Gerard Donnelly: And that would be perfect for a pancake-flat course with no hills, and we've got two of those races in Australia where there is just no hills.
[00:16:36] Gerard Donnelly: The elevation is like 10 metres, which is 20 feet for the whole course.
[00:16:42] Gerard Donnelly: So you wouldn't want to have a 23 or a 25 or a 28 or a 30 or a 32 option.
[00:16:48] Gerard Donnelly: There's no need for it, unless it's really windy.
[00:16:51] Gerard Donnelly: And so then, you know, wind and hills make you need more gear selection, all right?
[00:16:58] Gerard Donnelly: So, so...
[00:17:00] Gerard Donnelly: There's gotta be some point where you have to skip some gears because you've only got 12 choices and you've gotta make that choice.
[00:17:05] Gerard Donnelly: So normally people have an 11 rather than a 10.
[00:17:09] Gerard Donnelly: So they go 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, then they go 18, 20, 24, 28, 30, so that they can fit the easier gears.
[00:17:19] Gerard Donnelly: And so having a 30 teeth at the end will allow you to ride up any hill, okay?
[00:17:27] Gerard Donnelly: Having a 21, it means you'll be grinding.
[00:17:30] Gerard Donnelly: All right, having a 23 means you've got a little bit more capabilities of not grinding.
[00:17:35] Gerard Donnelly: And as you go up to 30, and a lot of people have a 32, which means any hill you could ride, you'd be coping with.
[00:17:43] Gerard Donnelly: So that's the rear cassette.
[00:17:44] Gerard Donnelly: And the front chain ring has two chain rings, the outside chain ring and the inside chain ring, all right?
[00:17:52] Gerard Donnelly: And that also has teeth.
[00:17:55] Gerard Donnelly: So you could count that yourself on your own bike.
[00:17:58] Gerard Donnelly: Most front chain rings are...
[00:18:00] Gerard Donnelly: could up doing.
[00:18:00] Gerard Donnelly: You start
[00:18:00] Gerard Donnelly: 53 on the outside and 39 on the inside, but some of them are 52, 36, which means there's 52 teeth rather than 53, and then the inside is 36 rather than 39.
[00:18:15] Gerard Donnelly: So if you had your chain on the inside and you were riding outside, you had your chain on the inside chain ring, and the easiest one at the back, that could be a 36 tooth and a 30 at the back.
[00:18:25] Gerard Donnelly: So a 36-30 means you could ride up pretty much any hill, but if you had a 39 and a 28 easy gear, that's so much harder to ride than, you know, you would be grinding.
[00:18:39] Gerard Donnelly: So the smaller the front chain ring number and the bigger the back chain ring, that means you're trying to get close to one-to-one.
[00:18:49] Gerard Donnelly: So you could get a 34-34, which means you've got the same size chain ring front and back, and that means you could ride up friggin' 20% hill.
[00:18:59] Gerard Donnelly: Cool.
[00:19:00] Gerard Donnelly: Cool.
[00:19:00] Gerard Donnelly: Cool.
[00:19:00] Gerard Donnelly: Cool.
[00:19:00] Gerard Donnelly: Cool.
[00:19:00] Gerard Donnelly: And so it's really important that you get that information.
[00:19:05] Gerard Donnelly: And, you know, if you work out that your rear is only a 28 or a 27 or a 25 or a 21, then you need to change that cassette.
[00:19:15] Gerard Donnelly: If it's already a 28, 30 or 32, that's really good.
[00:19:20] Gerard Donnelly: But it also depends on what the front smallest chainring is at the front of your cranks.
[00:19:27] Gerard Donnelly: And so if that's a 39 and then you only have a 39, 28, that's actually not good enough for a 7% hill.
[00:19:33] Gerard Donnelly: You need a 36 at the front.
[00:19:36] Gerard Donnelly: So we don't really like changing the front chainrings because it's easy just to change the back.
[00:19:42] Gerard Donnelly: But if you're, you know, you have to, you could go yourself and get, after you get back home, you can go and check your front and you can count them just manually.
[00:19:52] Gerard Donnelly: On the inside of the bike, it'll tell you what they are.
[00:19:55] Gerard Donnelly: It'll say 52, 36 or 52, 39 on you.
[00:20:00] Gerard Donnelly: On your chainrings.
[00:20:02] Gerard Donnelly: I hope I'm not talking above you here.
[00:20:05] Gerard Donnelly: Well, that makes sense.
[00:20:07] Gerard Donnelly: Yep.
[00:20:07] Gerard Donnelly: So it's really, you know, it is a hilly course.
[00:20:11] Gerard Donnelly: So you want to have the option to ride the easiest gear so that you, when you get to that 7% hill, how long is that hill?
[00:20:21] Gerard Donnelly: Oh, it's not very long.
[00:20:23] Abby Jorgensen: I listened to a course preview.
[00:20:26] Abby Jorgensen: Yep.
[00:20:27] Abby Jorgensen: so they said, yeah, you're not on it that long, but I mean, there's three hills that, that are really kind of back to back to back.
[00:20:35] Gerard Donnelly: Apparently they kind of.
[00:20:37] Gerard Donnelly: Time wise.
[00:20:38] Gerard Donnelly: What, what do you think?
[00:20:40] Gerard Donnelly: I'm trying to remember.
[00:20:43] Abby Jorgensen: I listened to it, but on top of my head, I was going to listen to it again.
[00:20:47] Abby Jorgensen: They say there's definitely spots on the course to go fast.
[00:20:50] Abby Jorgensen: Like there's flats and stuff, but, um, and it's a lot of rolling hills, but there's three main climbs and then the rest is rolling and flat.
[00:21:01] Gerard Donnelly: It's really the time, how much time are you going to spend there?
[00:21:06] Gerard Donnelly: Like, we've got this course in Sydney where it's a hill that's 18%, and you're only there for three minutes, and so it's not impacting you as much.
[00:21:25] Abby Jorgensen: Let's see.
[00:21:26] Gerard Donnelly: Math.
[00:21:28] Gerard Donnelly: Math, yeah.
[00:21:35] Gerard Donnelly: Math.
[00:21:36] Gerard Donnelly: let's share that page, eh?
[00:21:43] Gerard Donnelly: What should I just do?
[00:21:54] Gerard Donnelly: I'll try and share the map.
[00:21:56] Gerard Donnelly: OK.
[00:21:58] Abby Jorgensen: Thank you.
[00:22:23] Gerard Donnelly: It looks like it goes for that hill there, that's the first one, it starts at eight.
[00:22:32] Gerard Donnelly: And finishes at 10, so that's two miles, and the next one starts at 27 miles and finishes at 30, so that's three miles.
[00:22:44] Gerard Donnelly: And then 44 to 46, that's two miles, and that's the same hill, isn't it?
[00:22:53] Gerard Donnelly: Yeah, you go very close.
[00:22:57] Gerard Donnelly: So that's one hill, that's another hill, and then there's another hill.
[00:23:01] Gerard Donnelly: And it's that hill, and then it's back to the finish.
[00:23:05] Gerard Donnelly: So it's one, two, three, four, that's kind of a hill, five, six.
[00:23:11] Gerard Donnelly: So it seems to be six, so that's 12 hills total.
[00:23:25] Gerard Donnelly: So this hill looks quite steep.
[00:23:27] Gerard Donnelly: This is the one I think you're talking about, 7, 8%.
[00:23:30] Gerard Donnelly: And this has got two, 6%.
[00:23:35] Gerard Donnelly: So they've got some gradient in them, 8% there.
[00:23:43] Gerard Donnelly: Okay.
[00:23:43] Gerard Donnelly: So I think it's, if you could let me know and discuss it with him, if he's done the course, you know, he'll understand what I'm talking about, you know.
[00:23:55] Gerard Donnelly: If we just need to, I just need to know what's on your cassette, front and back.
[00:24:01] Gerard Donnelly: And when you get home, if you can just text me what your front chain ring is, if you can count them, you know, all I do is put my, if I'm trying to teach someone, say, put your finger on the top link, make sure the chain's off it, the chain's on the small, and just count, count the teeth.
[00:24:20] Gerard Donnelly: You you're going to count 50 teeth, or you're going to count 53.
[00:24:24] Gerard Donnelly: And then the inside, it's a lot harder to do, but you can still count.
[00:24:27] Gerard Donnelly: But it is stamped on the inside of both of those chain rings on the front, okay?
[00:24:33] Gerard Donnelly: And on the rear cassette, it will be stamped, but they're all, you can't read them, so you've got to actually count them all.
[00:24:40] Gerard Donnelly: So what I normally do is I take the wheel out of the bike, and I sit it up, and I just have the cassette there, and I just start counting, and write it down, and just count what I've got.
[00:24:51] Gerard Donnelly: Okay?
[00:24:53] Gerard Donnelly: And that way, I think, I think we really need to...
[00:25:00] Gerard Donnelly: Make sure our gearing's right, because we're going to have the best power plan in the world, but if you have to ride 160, 180 watts to get over every one of these hills because you've got the wrong gearing, that's going to really affect your whole race, Abby.
[00:25:17] Gerard Donnelly: So, you know, you're not changing anything on the way you ride.
[00:25:22] Gerard Donnelly: It's just you've got a gear that'll enable you to ride the same way you've been riding.
[00:25:27] Gerard Donnelly: If you don't have this gear option, you'll have to change the way you ride, which is kind of the opposite to what we're saying.
[00:25:34] Gerard Donnelly: If you leave the gear on that you've got and it's not good enough, you'll have to ride differently because you'll be riding with lower cadence and pushing bigger power, which is what we haven't practised.
[00:25:44] Gerard Donnelly: So if you change the cassette so that whenever you get to any of these hills, you can still ride the way we've been training in the same ranges.
[00:25:52] Gerard Donnelly: That's the reason why you would change.
[00:25:53] Gerard Donnelly: So I know I've spent a lot of time on that, but I'm a coaching point.
[00:25:57] Abby Jorgensen: Yeah, I didn't know how to address that because.
[00:26:00] Abby Jorgensen: You know, a lot of athletes like Coco and those guys over in Switzerland, she has so many hills too, and she's always asked how to ride the hills, and I'm like, well, obviously they're power range, but then they always tell me sometimes they can't stay, depending on the gradient of the hill.
[00:26:16] Gerard Donnelly: Yeah, and that should be the question everybody should be asking, you know, and the answer is, you need to tell me what your gear ratio is.
[00:26:27] Gerard Donnelly: That's the actual term.
[00:26:29] Gerard Donnelly: What is your front two chain rings, and what is your rear cassette, and, you know, if you've got any questions, you just, if Coco says to you, is this good enough, and you're not still sure about the answer, text that to me, and then you'll be able to learn that, you know, that some of the hardest mountains that I've ridden, I've used a 34-34, a one-to-one, and I've been able to ride up.
[00:26:57] Gerard Donnelly: That's all about the sort much.
[00:27:00] Gerard Donnelly: The worst steepest hill possible.
[00:27:03] Gerard Donnelly: But the time that you take to do these climbs, that's why I'm asking, how long is it?
[00:27:10] Gerard Donnelly: It goes for two miles.
[00:27:11] Gerard Donnelly: So how quick can you ride uphill for two miles?
[00:27:17] Gerard Donnelly: Well, it's probably five or six minutes.
[00:27:20] Gerard Donnelly: You know, so that's the important thing.
[00:27:23] Gerard Donnelly: Is it a 30 second climb at 8%?
[00:27:26] Gerard Donnelly: Or is it five or six minutes?
[00:27:28] Gerard Donnelly: Or is it 15 minutes?
[00:27:30] Gerard Donnelly: That's the crucial question to determine what gear ratio you have.
[00:27:34] Gerard Donnelly: So if you've got a really long climb that goes for a long time, you need to fix your cassette.
[00:27:40] Gerard Donnelly: If you've got a race that's just got one or two climbs that only go for two or three minutes, then it's not as impacting on your gear selection if there's lots of them.
[00:27:50] Gerard Donnelly: And I, when I look at this, I go, well, no, there's a lot of opportunities where you'll be having to ride 150, 160 watts if you don't have the right gear.
[00:28:00] Gerard Donnelly: Um, because you'll be forced to, otherwise you'll come to a standstill, Abby, you'll be, you'll be riding so slow cadence out of your seat, trying to get up these hills.
[00:28:10] Gerard Donnelly: Um, and you have to ride, you have to ride higher power because you've got no choice because you've got the wrong gear.
[00:28:16] Gerard Donnelly: Um, but if you've got a really easy gear where you can still keep pedaling up to seven or 8%, you can stay closer to your range of, you know, 110 to 140.
[00:28:30] Gerard Donnelly: So, so at all times, we're trying, you know, in an Ironman, we're just trying to conserve the whole time, um, and trying to ride, you know, uh, what, what was, what's 30, what's 30 K an hour in miles per hour?
[00:28:46] Gerard Donnelly: Um, uh, I did have it up.
[00:28:52] Gerard Donnelly: but like...
[00:28:55] Gerard Donnelly: Is it 17 or...
[00:28:58] Abby Jorgensen: 18.
[00:28:59] Abby Jorgensen: 18.
[00:28:59] Abby Jorgensen: 18.
[00:29:00] Abby Jorgensen: 18.
[00:29:00] Abby Jorgensen: 18.
[00:29:04] Gerard Donnelly: About 18.8 miles an hour, 18.6.
[00:29:08] Gerard Donnelly: Okay, so that's where you want to be.
[00:29:10] Gerard Donnelly: You want to be hovering around that 18 mile an hour mark.
[00:29:13] Gerard Donnelly: And then when you come to any of the hills, you'll be riding 9 miles an hour.
[00:29:19] Gerard Donnelly: And then some of the fast parts, you'll be riding 30 miles an hour.
[00:29:24] Gerard Donnelly: So your average, you're trying to average is 18 to get that 6 hours.
[00:29:30] Gerard Donnelly: And that's your goal.
[00:29:32] Gerard Donnelly: On this course, obviously, it's going to be a lot harder because it's got so much more elevation.
[00:29:41] Gerard Donnelly: I'm just going to check on.
[00:29:56] Gerard Donnelly: Just bear with me for a minute.
[00:29:58] Gerard Donnelly: So 6,000 feet.
[00:30:00] Gerard Donnelly: Is what that, is that the total?
[00:30:03] Gerard Donnelly: 6,800, yeah?
[00:30:05] Gerard Donnelly: Yeah.
[00:30:06] Abby Jorgensen: So that's nearly 2,000 metres.
[00:30:13] Gerard Donnelly: That is 2,000 metres.
[00:30:15] Gerard Donnelly: So that, you know, that means that this course is going to be really slow.
[00:30:22] Gerard Donnelly: So to do 2,000 metres of climbing over 180, or 6,800 feet over 113 miles is really a slow day, okay?
[00:30:33] Gerard Donnelly: So you might find, so when the athletes, when the women went to Nice last year, that had similar elevation, and they were having to add 20 to 30 minutes onto their normal 180k time, or 113 mile time.
[00:30:51] Gerard Donnelly: So if they were a six-hour rider for 113 miles, they were a six-hour 25 at Nice, okay?
[00:30:59] Gerard Donnelly: So you've...
[00:31:00] Gerard Donnelly: So you've got to actually get your brain to compute that, you know, I'm not going to probably average 18 miles an hour.
[00:31:09] Gerard Donnelly: I could be potentially averaging 16 and a half or 17.
[00:31:15] Gerard Donnelly: But because it's so undulating, there's literally, I can't see much.
[00:31:20] Gerard Donnelly: I can't see much.
[00:31:23] Gerard Donnelly: That seems to be about the only flat bit.
[00:31:26] Gerard Donnelly: Yeah, I don't know.
[00:31:27] Abby Jorgensen: First preview, they made it sound like there's some fast spots.
[00:31:30] Abby Jorgensen: I don't know where those are.
[00:31:32] Gerard Donnelly: Yeah.
[00:31:33] Gerard Donnelly: And so where the fast spots are would be the downhills, obviously.
[00:31:36] Gerard Donnelly: And once you get over the crest of these hills, try to keep the pressure on the pedals, Abby, and try to get momentum for the next hill.
[00:31:43] Gerard Donnelly: Try to keep the momentum.
[00:31:45] Gerard Donnelly: So you know how we're trying to ride lower watts on the fast parts?
[00:31:48] Gerard Donnelly: this is a time where when you get just to the bottom of the crest, you don't try to ride lower watts.
[00:31:55] Gerard Donnelly: You try to ride higher watts to get momentum.
[00:31:59] Gerard Donnelly: So you get a bit of a run up on all.
[00:32:01] Gerard Donnelly: One of these uphills from a downhill, you're trying to get momentum over the hill, okay?
[00:32:06] Gerard Donnelly: So it's okay to push good power in the range, obviously, in our range.
[00:32:11] Gerard Donnelly: So if your bike's doing 30 miles an hour, 35 miles an hour, we're always telling our athletes you don't have to push in more than 110, 115 watts.
[00:32:20] Gerard Donnelly: But when you get to the bottom of that, get the power back on so that you get momentum from the speed that you've already got.
[00:32:27] Gerard Donnelly: So those little gains, every time you do that, there's like 50 of them.
[00:32:31] Gerard Donnelly: Every time you do that, you're getting 10 seconds more, 10 seconds faster for literally no effort because you're staying in the range, okay?
[00:32:40] Gerard Donnelly: But don't freewheel into a hill.
[00:32:43] Gerard Donnelly: I don't mean you're freewheeling.
[00:32:44] Gerard Donnelly: Don't soft pedal into a hill.
[00:32:47] Gerard Donnelly: You know, get on the gas before you hit the hill at the top of the range so that you get an extra 10 meters for free every time you do that.
[00:32:58] Abby Jorgensen: Does that make sense what I'm saying?
[00:33:00] Gerard Donnelly: Yeah, mean,
[00:33:01] Gerard Donnelly: was kind of my plan.
[00:33:02] Gerard Donnelly: Yeah, it's not to ride the course, but try not to go outside that, you know, above that 140, and try not to go under 110.
[00:33:13] Gerard Donnelly: If the bike's scary fast, don't pedal, you know.
[00:33:18] Gerard Donnelly: If you're worried about, you know, you're doing 40 miles an hour on some of those downhills, you don't need to pedal.
[00:33:26] Gerard Donnelly: But remember I've told you, if you just keep your pedals turning over, it helps with balance.
[00:33:32] Gerard Donnelly: You don't want to be spinning out on a hill where you can't actually get resistance.
[00:33:38] Gerard Donnelly: So that's kind of what I want to go through with you.
[00:33:42] Gerard Donnelly: Yeah, that's helpful.
[00:33:44] Gerard Donnelly: That's the only part I worry about.
[00:33:47] Abby Jorgensen: Yeah.
[00:33:50] Abby Jorgensen: Yeah, so that section.
[00:33:52] Gerard Donnelly: So the wind, that's the other thing.
[00:33:54] Gerard Donnelly: We want to talk again before the race, but I want to find out about the wind, okay, and what it's doing on race.
[00:34:01] Gerard Donnelly: Yeah, right now it's just out of the west, five to ten miles.
[00:34:05] Gerard Donnelly: So coming this way?
[00:34:07] Gerard Donnelly: Yep.
[00:34:08] Gerard Donnelly: Yeah.
[00:34:08] Gerard Donnelly: So you've got a crosswind then, so you're going down with the winds coming across there, yeah?
[00:34:15] Gerard Donnelly: Yeah.
[00:34:16] Gerard Donnelly: to start, you've got a crosswind, then you've got a blockhead wind all the way to there really, haven't you?
[00:34:21] Gerard Donnelly: And it's a crosswind, and you've got this little tailwind, and then it's kind of a cross tail, isn't it?
[00:34:30] Gerard Donnelly: Yeah.
[00:34:31] Gerard Donnelly: you sneak away.
[00:34:32] Abby Jorgensen: it's five miles an hour, so it's not terrible, but it'll probably change.
[00:34:37] Gerard Donnelly: And then you've got this tailwind for that section.
[00:34:41] Gerard Donnelly: How far is that?
[00:34:42] Gerard Donnelly: That's 99 miles to, so that's seven mile tailwind.
[00:34:53] Gerard Donnelly: So from there, it's 40 miles from there to there.
[00:34:59] Gerard Donnelly: So you've got that.
[00:35:00] Gerard Donnelly: Yeah.
[00:35:01] Gerard Donnelly: 50 mile kind of cross tailwind, and that's pretty much 50 mile headwind cross.
[00:35:09] Gerard Donnelly: So the good thing is you're getting to do that twice.
[00:35:16] Gerard Donnelly: All right.
[00:35:18] Gerard Donnelly: We're going to talk about your athletes and talk about your stuff later.
[00:35:24] Gerard Donnelly: You okay with that?
[00:35:25] Gerard Donnelly: Yep.
[00:35:30] Gerard Donnelly: Disappointing with Dre, wasn't it?
[00:35:33] Abby Jorgensen: Yeah, he was, I mean, he sounded disappointed, but, you know, it's hard to, when you're buying a house, that stuff's hard.
[00:35:41] Gerard Donnelly: Yep.
[00:35:43] Gerard Donnelly: So I had a good chat to him.
[00:35:45] Gerard Donnelly: Yeah, he called before he, well, he tried to call you, said, and then he called me.
[00:35:50] Abby Jorgensen: Yep.
[00:35:53] Gerard Donnelly: So I spoke to him after he spoke to you.
[00:35:57] Gerard Donnelly: Hmm.
[00:35:59] Gerard Donnelly: Um...
[00:36:00] Gerard Donnelly: Hmm.
[00:36:01] Gerard Donnelly: So yeah, just one of those things.
[00:36:03] Gerard Donnelly: And look, he might come back.
[00:36:06] Gerard Donnelly: So one of the things, Abby, that I want you to do is just have yourself a reminder every couple of weeks just to reach out to him and say, just with a text message, just to say, hey, Dre, just checking in.
[00:36:25] Gerard Donnelly: And I'm sure he'll still have his data.
[00:36:33] Gerard Donnelly: Some athletes actually, they take themselves off training peaks so we can't see them.
[00:36:40] Gerard Donnelly: So you've done his program for him.
[00:36:50] Abby Jorgensen: So he's paused the program.
[00:36:51] Gerard Donnelly: So he didn't have to do that.
[00:36:56] Abby Jorgensen: I was trying to get ahead for next week.
[00:36:58] Abby Jorgensen: Yeah.
[00:36:59] Gerard Donnelly: A little bit.
[00:37:00] Gerard Donnelly: Yeah.
[00:37:02] Gerard Donnelly: So we, you know, he stopped paying from next week.
[00:37:08] Gerard Donnelly: So Monday, tomorrow.
[00:37:12] Gerard Donnelly: So we'll just give him that program.
[00:37:14] Gerard Donnelly: You've done it for him.
[00:37:18] Gerard Donnelly: Is that what you've done?
[00:37:20] Gerard Donnelly: Yeah.
[00:37:22] Abby Jorgensen: Yeah, I've already, like, I told him we'd keep in contact and all that stuff.
[00:37:27] Gerard Donnelly: So, yeah.
[00:37:30] Gerard Donnelly: It's super important that you do that because he will come back if you do that.
[00:37:35] Gerard Donnelly: And he's a really easy athlete to coach.
[00:37:38] Gerard Donnelly: Yeah, super easy.
[00:37:39] Gerard Donnelly: Yeah.
[00:37:40] Gerard Donnelly: Okay.
[00:37:41] Gerard Donnelly: Anybody you want to highlight that you've got questions on?
[00:37:45] Gerard Donnelly: I know you're at your friend's house and you don't want to be here all night.
[00:37:51] Gerard Donnelly: So tell me anybody that you'd like to, first of all, that you think you need assistance with.
[00:37:59] Abby Jorgensen: Um.
[00:38:00] Abby Jorgensen: Um.
[00:38:01] Abby Jorgensen: I mean, other, like, this week, so I have Cindy, Peter, and Cynthia all doing Santa Cruz.
[00:38:10] Abby Jorgensen: Philippe's doing his Olympic.
[00:38:13] Abby Jorgensen: I'm to call him tonight or tomorrow, and we're going to talk over his one.
[00:38:18] Abby Jorgensen: And then I'll call Nancy and Peter and everybody.
[00:38:23] Abby Jorgensen: With Cynthia, she's come to the conclusion, like, she's just trying to get her knee healthy.
[00:38:28] Abby Jorgensen: So, like, we're trying to take it as easy as possible, and she's okay with, you know, just going to Santa Cruz and getting through the race.
[00:38:36] Abby Jorgensen: So I don't want her to – she doesn't want to get – overdo it and then not be able to do world championships.
[00:38:43] Gerard Donnelly: Yeah.
[00:38:44] Gerard Donnelly: Should she – how bad is the name?
[00:38:47] Gerard Donnelly: Should she be doing the race?
[00:38:48] Gerard Donnelly: I mean, today she said it felt better.
[00:38:53] Abby Jorgensen: So we're just kind of taking it day by day.
[00:38:55] Abby Jorgensen: I'm trying not to do a whole lot of running or strenuous, like, riding.
[00:38:59] Abby Jorgensen: When she rides, she says it feels fine.
[00:39:01] Abby Jorgensen: And so it's more the, it's just like her PT is saying it's more like a tight IT band and stuff.
[00:39:09] Abby Jorgensen: So that stuff takes, you know, comes and goes.
[00:39:13] Gerard Donnelly: Yeah, well, is she working at it most days?
[00:39:17] Gerard Donnelly: I can see she's done Monday, Thursday, Saturday, but is she doing, that could be just strength work.
[00:39:24] Gerard Donnelly: Like, is she doing any rehab for tight ITB, which is, you know, stretching?
[00:39:31] Gerard Donnelly: Yeah, that would be.
[00:39:32] Gerard Donnelly: Yeah.
[00:39:33] Abby Jorgensen: So I talked her through, like, she sent me what she was doing and what her PT had had her do.
[00:39:38] Abby Jorgensen: So, yeah, everything looked just like I would probably tell her to do.
[00:39:42] Abby Jorgensen: So, yeah, she's working on that stuff.
[00:39:44] Abby Jorgensen: Yeah.
[00:39:45] Abby Jorgensen: Okay.
[00:39:46] Gerard Donnelly: It makes it difficult when we haven't tested her to have a race plan.
[00:39:49] Abby Jorgensen: She did, let's see, she did do a 75.
[00:39:58] Abby Jorgensen: 75.
[00:40:01] Gerard Donnelly: This one, yep.
[00:40:02] Gerard Donnelly: Kilometre one, yeah.
[00:40:04] Gerard Donnelly: So you need to explain to her that normally we would do a 60-minute FTP.
[00:40:09] Gerard Donnelly: Yeah, we're going to do it this weekend, but with her knee, we weren't going to push it.
[00:40:18] Abby Jorgensen: So she's sitting around that 120.
[00:40:23] Gerard Donnelly: So this is about the only information you could use, Abby, I think.
[00:40:26] Gerard Donnelly: Okay.
[00:40:29] Gerard Donnelly: So she's done that.
[00:40:35] Gerard Donnelly: She's around that 119, 120.
[00:40:39] Gerard Donnelly: 119 normalise, 117.
[00:40:42] Gerard Donnelly: For 18, that's 18.5 miles an hour.
[00:40:46] Gerard Donnelly: Now that we know that 30 equals, that's exactly your speed.
[00:40:49] Gerard Donnelly: So that would be useful to help her.
[00:40:54] Gerard Donnelly: I'm just thinking of, you know, when you go to do a race plan, you'll have to talk about the...
[00:41:00] Gerard Donnelly: The...
[00:41:01] Gerard Donnelly: Sessions, that any session she's done where she's got some, you know, did she miss that one, she?
[00:41:08] Gerard Donnelly: Yeah.
[00:41:11] Gerard Donnelly: And she ran off the bike at 5.19 pace.
[00:41:26] Gerard Donnelly: So, yeah, just really, the goal is just to get through the event, but if her knee's, patella, patella tracking is probably what she's got with the ITB.
[00:41:36] Gerard Donnelly: Yeah.
[00:41:36] Gerard Donnelly: I mean, that's what my knee does too, so.
[00:41:39] Gerard Donnelly: Yeah, so it's really getting the foam roller on and getting someone to dig in there and getting your hip, you know, stretched and glute stretched and backstretched.
[00:41:48] Gerard Donnelly: So, yeah.
[00:41:52] Gerard Donnelly: Has she had this before or is it just something that's come?
[00:41:56] Abby Jorgensen: She, yeah, she said it's newer to her, so.
[00:42:01] Abby Jorgensen: I don't know why all of a sudden it popped up.
[00:42:06] Abby Jorgensen: Yeah.
[00:42:08] Abby Jorgensen: Because she's been a runner her whole life, so she said that that's the part that she never easily worries about from a running standpoint.
[00:42:17] Gerard Donnelly: So the worry is that her bike fits.
[00:42:21] Gerard Donnelly: That's what I asked her to do.
[00:42:22] Abby Jorgensen: I asked her when the last time she had a bike fit.
[00:42:26] Abby Jorgensen: She's like, well, that's a good one.
[00:42:31] Abby Jorgensen: Make sure that's not an issue.
[00:42:34] Gerard Donnelly: Because she hasn't been training on the bike like this before, I imagine.
[00:42:37] Gerard Donnelly: Yeah, that's what I said, too.
[00:42:39] Abby Jorgensen: That's what her PT said, like the added coaching and the different types of rides and stuff she's done might have, you know.
[00:42:47] Gerard Donnelly: Yeah, I think that's the, you know, she should be getting that as soon as possible, getting that done.
[00:42:55] Gerard Donnelly: Because I don't think it's going to help if she just keeps riding the bike the way it is.
[00:42:58] Gerard Donnelly: Because that's what's, you've got to put, find.
[00:43:01] Gerard Donnelly: The cause of the issue.
[00:43:04] Gerard Donnelly: Doing the rehab is absolutely perfect, but if you do the rehab and you just keep doing the bike riding sessions, it's just going to keep coming back if the bike's not set up properly.
[00:43:19] Gerard Donnelly: So Coco is okay with her prep?
[00:43:25] Abby Jorgensen: Yeah.
[00:43:25] Abby Jorgensen: Her foot started to bother her last week, so this week we took out some of the running.
[00:43:33] Abby Jorgensen: Her big toe started to hurt or something, so she freaked out and just was like, I'm not going to run the rest of the week.
[00:43:42] Abby Jorgensen: She knows her running, obviously, if do not run and she runs fine, so I'm like, all right, let's just.
[00:43:49] Gerard Donnelly: Yeah, I don't think, I think, Abby, don't give anybody any more monofart-like stuff, okay?
[00:43:56] Gerard Donnelly: Okay.
[00:43:57] Gerard Donnelly: Give them the tempo intervals at most, all right?
[00:44:02] Gerard Donnelly: So you can do the 3x10.
[00:44:05] Gerard Donnelly: The tempo intervals have to add up to 30 minutes, okay?
[00:44:09] Gerard Donnelly: So you can do any combination, 5x6, 10x3, 3x10, even 4x8 is still okay.
[00:44:19] Gerard Donnelly: It's 32 minutes.
[00:44:21] Gerard Donnelly: But any combination of that, you can mix it up that way, all right?
[00:44:25] Gerard Donnelly: And the pace they should be running is somewhere between, for the shorter ones, if you get them to do 10x3 minutes with 60 seconds rest, then you can run between 10 and half marathon pace, 10k and half marathon pace, okay?
[00:44:42] Gerard Donnelly: If you're getting them to do 5x6, it's okay to run them at half marathon pace.
[00:44:46] Gerard Donnelly: If you're getting them to do longer intervals, you can get them to do between half marathon and maybe 20 miles.
[00:44:56] Gerard Donnelly: So the shorter intervals, the easy way to remember is the 3 minutes.
[00:45:01] Gerard Donnelly: That's the faster pace, but nothing faster than came to half marathon pace.
[00:45:07] Gerard Donnelly: And then the medium five by six, that would be half marathon.
[00:45:11] Gerard Donnelly: And then the longer intervals, 10 minutes, three by 10, that would be around that half marathon to 20 mile pace.
[00:45:19] Gerard Donnelly: Okay.
[00:45:20] Gerard Donnelly: And the impact is far less, the monofart leg is really probably too advanced for the majority of our athletes.
[00:45:28] Gerard Donnelly: There's only, you know, I only give that to probably, you know, the guys who can run 34 to 36 minutes for 10K.
[00:45:40] Gerard Donnelly: We've got guys who can run 32.
[00:45:42] Gerard Donnelly: So they would get that session because they've been a runner.
[00:45:46] Gerard Donnelly: Anybody who's running 40 minutes to 50 minutes to 60 minutes for 10K, it's too hard for them, too stressful on them, too risky.
[00:45:56] Abby Jorgensen: Yeah, I didn't know her since she's like a 1.30 half marathon.
[00:46:01] Gerard Donnelly: Yeah, and she's not far away, but she can still benefit from – remember, they're getting the intensity from the bike, so we've just got to be careful we don't – because it's like another VO2 session, the Monofart Lake.
[00:46:17] Gerard Donnelly: Doogie, he's okay?
[00:46:19] Abby Jorgensen: Yeah, he's just getting back from vacation, so I'm going to try to get him on the bike this week before his cycling event.
[00:46:29] Gerard Donnelly: Yeah.
[00:46:31] Gerard Donnelly: Trying to just get him on the bike.
[00:46:34] Abby Jorgensen: I'm like, just get on the bike.
[00:46:36] Abby Jorgensen: Yeah.
[00:46:38] Gerard Donnelly: Yeah, so his holiday's over.
[00:46:42] Gerard Donnelly: Yeah.
[00:46:43] Gerard Donnelly: He didn't time that very well.
[00:46:44] Gerard Donnelly: Going to Greece before his big event.
[00:46:47] Gerard Donnelly: Yeah, all right.
[00:46:49] Abby Jorgensen: What about Andrew?
[00:46:51] Gerard Donnelly: He's doing good.
[00:46:52] Abby Jorgensen: Had a flat yesterday, so had a rough, long day.
[00:46:58] Abby Jorgensen: Get that fixed because of the CO2 cartridge.
[00:47:01] Abby Jorgensen: Yeah.
[00:47:01] Abby Jorgensen: Wasn't working.
[00:47:03] Gerard Donnelly: Oh, no.
[00:47:05] Gerard Donnelly: He finished it.
[00:47:06] Abby Jorgensen: So, but it was just a long day for him.
[00:47:09] Abby Jorgensen: So.
[00:47:14] Gerard Donnelly: And his running's going okay?
[00:47:17] Abby Jorgensen: Yeah, he says he usually feels pretty good with the run.
[00:47:20] Abby Jorgensen: It's starting to cool down there.
[00:47:21] Abby Jorgensen: So.
[00:47:22] Abby Jorgensen: Yep.
[00:47:23] Gerard Donnelly: Doing a little better.
[00:47:24] Gerard Donnelly: Great.
[00:47:28] Gerard Donnelly: Yeah, that's good, Abby.
[00:47:32] Gerard Donnelly: That's perfect.
[00:47:33] Gerard Donnelly: Good stuff.
[00:47:34] Gerard Donnelly: And Cindy, we've discussed.
[00:47:36] Gerard Donnelly: Isabella, did you check her marathon?
[00:47:38] Gerard Donnelly: Did she make it?
[00:47:40] Gerard Donnelly: She did.
[00:47:41] Abby Jorgensen: I followed it.
[00:47:43] Abby Jorgensen: It actually didn't do too bad.
[00:47:45] Gerard Donnelly: Super.
[00:47:47] Gerard Donnelly: Oh, my God.
[00:47:51] Gerard Donnelly: It was a perfect day.
[00:47:54] Gerard Donnelly: I mean, she was pretty consistent.
[00:47:56] Abby Jorgensen: mean.
[00:47:57] Gerard Donnelly: She faded at the end.
[00:47:59] Gerard Donnelly: Yeah, she said she had to start stretching at the end.
[00:48:06] Gerard Donnelly: It goes pretty much uphill at the start for some reason.
[00:48:15] Gerard Donnelly: It's not showing it, but anyway, so she's running, classic isn't it, 5.56 pace.
[00:48:26] Gerard Donnelly: She ends up running at 7-minute K pace.
[00:48:30] Gerard Donnelly: That's like starting at 8-minute mile and ending up at 12-minute mile.
[00:48:35] Gerard Donnelly: Anyway, so enough about her.
[00:48:38] Gerard Donnelly: So just recovery, that's good, just easy.
[00:48:41] Gerard Donnelly: Well done.
[00:48:41] Abby Jorgensen: I'm going to figure out what her next steps are.
[00:48:46] Abby Jorgensen: I think she wants to just keep running, so we'll figure that out.
[00:48:50] Gerard Donnelly: Yeah.
[00:48:52] Gerard Donnelly: Rick?
[00:48:54] Abby Jorgensen: Rick, he's been on his regular bike this week, so we're going to do another FTP test.
[00:49:02] Gerard Donnelly: Is he injured as well, is he?
[00:49:04] Gerard Donnelly: Yeah, yep.
[00:49:06] Abby Jorgensen: Bicep, tendon, re-surgery.
[00:49:09] Abby Jorgensen: Yeah, what was he?
[00:49:11] Gerard Donnelly: Remind me.
[00:49:12] Abby Jorgensen: He, I don't know, he went to pick something up one day and he felt a tear in his bicep and thought it was just like a strain.
[00:49:21] Abby Jorgensen: And then eventually went back to the doctor and they said it was, he had to reattach the tendon.
[00:49:28] Gerard Donnelly: Yes, wow, that's amazing.
[00:49:30] Gerard Donnelly: Interesting.
[00:49:31] Abby Jorgensen: So, and then he wanted to add some cross training because he can't run yet.
[00:49:35] Abby Jorgensen: So we're going to do, he's like, there's a stair stepper.
[00:49:37] Abby Jorgensen: I'm like, that's fine.
[00:49:38] Abby Jorgensen: I'll get some leg impacts, whatever you want to do.
[00:49:42] Abby Jorgensen: And then he has rehab Tuesday, Thursdays.
[00:49:44] Abby Jorgensen: And then, yeah.
[00:49:46] Gerard Donnelly: That's great.
[00:49:47] Gerard Donnelly: Give him five, five bike sessions per week until he's ready.
[00:49:51] Gerard Donnelly: Just make sure you've got one long ride.
[00:49:54] Gerard Donnelly: Make sure you've got the two high intensity and make sure you've got the zone two, which you've got.
[00:49:58] Gerard Donnelly: And the other one can be recovery ride.
[00:50:00] Gerard Donnelly: So.
[00:50:02] Gerard Donnelly: That's great.
[00:50:03] Gerard Donnelly: Okay.
[00:50:05] Gerard Donnelly: Michaela?
[00:50:07] Gerard Donnelly: She's getting near the end and you can tell.
[00:50:10] Abby Jorgensen: Some of our sessions, he's like, these are crazy.
[00:50:12] Abby Jorgensen: I'm like, no, these are right work.
[00:50:15] Gerard Donnelly: I love her though.
[00:50:16] Abby Jorgensen: She's good.
[00:50:17] Abby Jorgensen: She's getting close.
[00:50:21] Abby Jorgensen: She's doing like her rides are really, like if you look at her rides, they're like really good.
[00:50:26] Abby Jorgensen: She's good.
[00:50:31] Gerard Donnelly: She left Noosa.
[00:50:33] Gerard Donnelly: Yeah, she's back.
[00:50:35] Gerard Donnelly: That's amazing.
[00:50:37] Gerard Donnelly: Yeah.
[00:50:38] Gerard Donnelly: How was that?
[00:50:38] Abby Jorgensen: Hey.
[00:50:40] Abby Jorgensen: Yeah.
[00:50:41] Abby Jorgensen: She's riding really well.
[00:50:43] Abby Jorgensen: She's running better than she thinks she is.
[00:50:48] Gerard Donnelly: Yep.
[00:50:50] Gerard Donnelly: If she feels she can push more watts, then tell her.
[00:50:55] Gerard Donnelly: Yeah.
[00:50:57] Gerard Donnelly: She's riding quite slow there.
[00:51:00] Gerard Donnelly: So, um...
[00:51:02] Gerard Donnelly: Yeah.
[00:51:03] Abby Jorgensen: don't know how that translates.
[00:51:05] Abby Jorgensen: Yeah.
[00:51:05] Abby Jorgensen: To me, it's like 16 miles an hour, 16 point, whatever.
[00:51:08] Abby Jorgensen: So yeah, it is very slow.
[00:51:17] Gerard Donnelly: There's no elevation to set.
[00:51:21] Gerard Donnelly: If I didn't know better, I'd say that's, I'd say that's indoor.
[00:51:26] Gerard Donnelly: Yeah.
[00:51:29] Abby Jorgensen: I know.
[00:51:29] Abby Jorgensen: I opened it and I was like, had to look at the map and I was like, dang.
[00:51:34] Abby Jorgensen: Okay.
[00:51:35] Gerard Donnelly: So when she gets to the hills, you know, she's allowed to ride up higher in the range.
[00:51:42] Gerard Donnelly: 133.
[00:51:43] Gerard Donnelly: She doesn't really.
[00:51:47] Gerard Donnelly: She's going downhill.
[00:51:48] Gerard Donnelly: Is she riding any faster?
[00:51:51] Gerard Donnelly: I don't know.
[00:51:51] Gerard Donnelly: That doesn't even make sense.
[00:51:53] Gerard Donnelly: She's slower downhill than she's uphill.
[00:51:57] Gerard Donnelly: Does that make sense?
[00:51:58] Gerard Donnelly: How's that possible?
[00:52:02] Gerard Donnelly: It's not a lot of elevation, but she's doing 26 k's an hour downhill.
[00:52:08] Gerard Donnelly: She's doing 27 k's an hour uphill.
[00:52:14] Gerard Donnelly: That's weird.
[00:52:17] Gerard Donnelly: All right.
[00:52:18] Gerard Donnelly: Good?
[00:52:20] Abby Jorgensen: Rihanna?
[00:52:22] Abby Jorgensen: Rihanna, she's kind of getting back on the train here.
[00:52:27] Abby Jorgensen: Good stuff.
[00:52:31] Abby Jorgensen: Yeah, she had a swim lesson, too, with some top coach there in Boulder, Beth Davis.
[00:52:39] Gerard Donnelly: Yep.
[00:52:43] Abby Jorgensen: But, yeah, she wants to do, I mean, I asked her about doing the half marathon instead of the marathon, and she's like, I'd rather do the marathon, even if it's slower.
[00:52:55] Abby Jorgensen: But, so we'll see what, because she said they, three weeks away.
[00:53:00] Abby Jorgensen: Okay, so.
[00:53:01] Gerard Donnelly: you.
[00:53:01] Gerard Donnelly: you.
[00:53:01] Gerard Donnelly: right.
[00:53:01] Gerard Donnelly: Yeah.
[00:53:01] Gerard Donnelly: Thank
[00:53:02] Gerard Donnelly: How much running has she done, Abby?
[00:53:08] Abby Jorgensen: Well, when she was sick, she had COVID, so she didn't run for a while, but she felt really good on the run this week, wherever it was.
[00:53:18] Abby Jorgensen: She ran at some point this week, I know.
[00:53:23] Gerard Donnelly: Oh, my goodness.
[00:53:26] Abby Jorgensen: Yeah, she had a lot of work, travel, and she moved, and it was a...
[00:53:32] Gerard Donnelly: She's already being, like, 21, so that's, like, how far is a half marathon in miles?
[00:53:38] Gerard Donnelly: 12 miles, is it 13 miles?
[00:53:40] Gerard Donnelly: 13.1, yeah.
[00:53:43] Gerard Donnelly: So 13 miles, 3 miles, 3 miles, no miles, no miles.
[00:53:54] Gerard Donnelly: No miles, 9 miles.
[00:54:04] Gerard Donnelly: Five miles, finally she's done 15 miles, 10 miles, another 15 mile week, another 15 mile week, 16 mile week.
[00:54:23] Gerard Donnelly: So it's, it is a really, oh, she's still got to do a long run yet, but that'll be a bigger week.
[00:54:31] Gerard Donnelly: Has she done that already, has she, or?
[00:54:35] Abby Jorgensen: I haven't seen it come through on my end.
[00:54:41] Gerard Donnelly: From a care point of view, you would be going, this is not a good idea.
[00:54:48] Abby Jorgensen: Yeah, I mean, I told her it probably wasn't the brightest idea.
[00:54:53] Gerard Donnelly: What sort of runner is she?
[00:54:59] Abby Jorgensen: Not super fast.
[00:55:03] Abby Jorgensen: Like a 2.10 and a half.
[00:55:06] Abby Jorgensen: Yep.
[00:55:10] Gerard Donnelly: She's run a, this year she's run a 16, two year right, spot on.
[00:55:17] Gerard Donnelly: So she's going to be a 4.20 plus another 10 to 15.
[00:55:25] Gerard Donnelly: So she's going to be 4.5 to 4.40.
[00:55:31] Gerard Donnelly: Imagine the recovery from this.
[00:55:36] Gerard Donnelly: So the only thing you can do is point out that this will really put you back with recovery.
[00:55:43] Gerard Donnelly: You'll take a long time to recover from it.
[00:55:51] Gerard Donnelly: Is there anything else after that that she's aiming for yet?
[00:55:55] Abby Jorgensen: She just has a Ironman Copenhagen, but that's next year.
[00:55:59] Abby Jorgensen: Yep.
[00:55:59] Abby Jorgensen: back to you.
[00:56:00] Gerard Donnelly: Thank you.
[00:56:02] Abby Jorgensen: She's going to look at, there's like some gravel races and some just cycling events there in Colorado that she wants to do.
[00:56:09] Gerard Donnelly: So she just hasn't signed up for anything yet.
[00:56:13] Gerard Donnelly: Is there a particular reason why she wants to do the marathon over your advice to do a half?
[00:56:18] Abby Jorgensen: She said because her and her boyfriend, Tom, or fiance, they've paid for it and they can't get a refund.
[00:56:26] Abby Jorgensen: You can't move from full to half?
[00:56:29] Gerard Donnelly: I asked her that and she's like, she'd rather not.
[00:56:32] Abby Jorgensen: She'd rather just, if she has to walk, do the marathon.
[00:56:36] Abby Jorgensen: Because that's, I mean, I was like, what's the difference between doing a half and a, I mean, I try to convince her, but yeah.
[00:56:47] Gerard Donnelly: All you can do is give your advice and, you know, if she ends up injured and can't train, it's just crazy.
[00:56:55] Gerard Donnelly: It really is.
[00:56:58] Gerard Donnelly: Yeah, for sure.
[00:57:00] Abby Jorgensen: sure.
[00:57:05] Gerard Donnelly: All right.
[00:57:06] Gerard Donnelly: don't know if I heard.
[00:57:09] Gerard Donnelly: Blair.
[00:57:13] Abby Jorgensen: He's good.
[00:57:14] Abby Jorgensen: We're just getting, let's see here.
[00:57:20] Abby Jorgensen: This week.
[00:57:21] Abby Jorgensen: Yeah.
[00:57:21] Abby Jorgensen: And then he has his charity.
[00:57:24] Gerard Donnelly: Is there anything else he's aiming for?
[00:57:26] Abby Jorgensen: He has Ironman Canada next year.
[00:57:28] Abby Jorgensen: Yeah.
[00:57:30] Abby Jorgensen: Oh, I told him once we get done with this race, we'll recover and then get into just a regular base training program again.
[00:57:36] Abby Jorgensen: So.
[00:57:37] Abby Jorgensen: Great.
[00:57:37] Abby Jorgensen: Yep.
[00:57:38] Gerard Donnelly: Okay.
[00:57:39] Gerard Donnelly: Glenn, how's he recovered from the marathon?
[00:57:41] Gerard Donnelly: Has you had a conversation with him yet?
[00:57:43] Gerard Donnelly: Yeah, he's felt good.
[00:57:44] Gerard Donnelly: He had a run, well, Sunday or yesterday.
[00:57:47] Abby Jorgensen: said he felt really good.
[00:57:49] Abby Jorgensen: I mean, he's felt pretty good all week, he said, but.
[00:57:53] Abby Jorgensen: That's terrific.
[00:57:54] Gerard Donnelly: Yep.
[00:57:56] Gerard Donnelly: Yep.
[00:57:56] Gerard Donnelly: What's his next race, Abby?
[00:57:58] Abby Jorgensen: Uh, Ironman muscle.
[00:58:01] Abby Jorgensen: Is it Busselton?
[00:58:03] Gerard Donnelly: Okay.
[00:58:05] Gerard Donnelly: December.
[00:58:06] Gerard Donnelly: Yeah.
[00:58:07] Gerard Donnelly: Busso, as we call it in Australia.
[00:58:11] Gerard Donnelly: The flat one.
[00:58:13] Gerard Donnelly: That's the pancake flat one, but it is very windy.
[00:58:16] Gerard Donnelly: It's just a little hill.
[00:58:17] Gerard Donnelly: There's no hill on the whole course.
[00:58:20] Gerard Donnelly: And Abby, it just goes that direction, and it goes that direction, and it goes that direction, and it comes back, and it goes back out, and it comes back, and it goes back out, and it back.
[00:58:29] Gerard Donnelly: So the whole time, if the wind's going like that, all the way out, it's two laps, out and back, out and back.
[00:58:37] Gerard Donnelly: You're just changing direction.
[00:58:38] Gerard Donnelly: So one minute you've got a tailwind, you've got a crosswind, then you've got a headwind, then you've got a crosswind, then you've got a tailwind.
[00:58:44] Gerard Donnelly: So you don't get the whole out and back thing of just steady headwind, steady tailwind, because you're changing direction so many times.
[00:58:51] Gerard Donnelly: So that's a real skill to ride this course, because you've got to ride the wind, because there's no gradient change.
[00:59:00] Gerard Donnelly: So...
[00:59:01] Gerard Donnelly: You've to get the athlete to not just ride, say, for example, you're going to ride 100 watts.
[00:59:06] Gerard Donnelly: That's your average.
[00:59:08] Gerard Donnelly: You know, in the headwind, you need to be riding 110.
[00:59:10] Gerard Donnelly: In the tailwind, you need to be riding 90.
[00:59:12] Gerard Donnelly: So every time you change direction, you need to change your approach to what power you ride according to the wind.
[00:59:19] Gerard Donnelly: And most people just try to ride the whole damn thing at 100, you know, whether they go in tailwind or headwind.
[00:59:25] Gerard Donnelly: And that's just the slowest way to ride this course.
[00:59:28] Gerard Donnelly: You've got to ride, you should be doing this on every course, but it's more obvious.
[00:59:31] Gerard Donnelly: A course like that.
[00:59:32] Gerard Donnelly: Anyway, well, it's good that he's recovered so well.
[00:59:36] Gerard Donnelly: Yeah, he said he felt great.
[00:59:39] Gerard Donnelly: Yeah, okay.
[00:59:40] Gerard Donnelly: And Drayden, we've talked about Philippe.
[00:59:44] Gerard Donnelly: Yeah, I mean, he's been doing really well.
[00:59:49] Abby Jorgensen: Just getting ready for his race.
[00:59:51] Gerard Donnelly: Olympic Olympics, yep.
[00:59:59] Gerard Donnelly: Let's see.
[01:00:03] Gerard Donnelly: So have tested him recently?
[01:00:05] Gerard Donnelly: Yeah, that previous week.
[01:00:07] Gerard Donnelly: Yep, this week here, yep.
[01:00:09] Gerard Donnelly: Has he done an outdoor test?
[01:00:10] Gerard Donnelly: Yep, that Friday.
[01:00:13] Gerard Donnelly: That Friday, great.
[01:00:14] Gerard Donnelly: Fantastic.
[01:00:15] Gerard Donnelly: Yep, alright, so you've got good numbers there?
[01:00:17] Gerard Donnelly: Yep.
[01:00:19] Abby Jorgensen: 208, it was.
[01:00:29] Gerard Donnelly: 60 minutes, 208, great.
[01:00:30] Gerard Donnelly: What was his speed?
[01:00:31] Gerard Donnelly: Oh, not too bad.
[01:00:33] Gerard Donnelly: Is he on a time trial, or?
[01:00:36] Gerard Donnelly: I believe so, yeah.
[01:00:39] Gerard Donnelly: Yeah, great.
[01:00:40] Gerard Donnelly: Really good.
[01:00:41] Gerard Donnelly: Okay, so obviously anything between 80 and 90% of 208.
[01:00:48] Gerard Donnelly: Yep, okay.
[01:00:49] Abby Jorgensen: Yeah, that was one, was it 180 something?
[01:00:52] Abby Jorgensen: I figured it out earlier today.
[01:00:54] Abby Jorgensen: I can't remember off the top of my head.
[01:00:56] Gerard Donnelly: Has he done any race ready?
[01:00:58] Gerard Donnelly: Yep, there's one there.
[01:00:58] Gerard Donnelly: Is that one?
[01:01:01] Gerard Donnelly: Oh, yeah.
[01:01:01] Gerard Donnelly: I'm not.
[01:01:01] Gerard Donnelly: glad.
[01:01:01] Gerard Donnelly: I'm
[01:01:02] Abby Jorgensen: Yeah, he rode at like 197, 192, or something like that for those.
[01:01:09] Gerard Donnelly: So he's doing Olympic, isn't he?
[01:01:11] Gerard Donnelly: Sorry.
[01:01:12] Gerard Donnelly: I just gave half Ironman.
[01:01:14] Gerard Donnelly: Yeah.
[01:01:15] Gerard Donnelly: I'm 96.
[01:01:16] Gerard Donnelly: So what's that?
[01:01:18] Gerard Donnelly: That's good.
[01:01:19] Gerard Donnelly: 25%.
[01:01:19] Gerard Donnelly: Has he got his FTP set right from that or outside?
[01:01:23] Gerard Donnelly: This was outside, yeah?
[01:01:24] Gerard Donnelly: Yes, it was.
[01:01:25] Gerard Donnelly: Yeah.
[01:01:28] Gerard Donnelly: Really good.
[01:01:30] Gerard Donnelly: Got him going.
[01:01:31] Gerard Donnelly: That's great.
[01:01:35] Gerard Donnelly: What about running?
[01:01:37] Gerard Donnelly: Have got his plan for running?
[01:01:39] Abby Jorgensen: Yeah, we're going to start at about a 540 pace and then work up, you know, if he feels good.
[01:01:46] Abby Jorgensen: He can get on a 10K at a 5, what is it, 521 pace, 522.
[01:01:57] Gerard Donnelly: Sorry, 5K.
[01:01:58] Gerard Donnelly: 521 522 pace, 522 522 pace, pace, pace, 522 522 pace, 622 pace
[01:02:01] Gerard Donnelly: Yep.
[01:02:03] Gerard Donnelly: 4.57, is that right?
[01:02:16] Gerard Donnelly: Good.
[01:02:16] Gerard Donnelly: So, are you talking miles there, were you?
[01:02:23] Abby Jorgensen: Well, no, like 5.4, like a 5.4.
[01:02:26] Abby Jorgensen: So he has a 10K as well.
[01:02:29] Abby Jorgensen: And he has a 6K off the bike as well, that we just did.
[01:02:37] Gerard Donnelly: So, 5.20, okay, 53, yep, okay.
[01:02:41] Gerard Donnelly: And then his?
[01:02:43] Gerard Donnelly: Yep, that's great.
[01:02:47] Gerard Donnelly: Yep.
[01:02:58] Gerard Donnelly: That's really good.
[01:03:01] Gerard Donnelly: Oh, he's sick.
[01:03:05] Gerard Donnelly: And then the swim is, you know, he said, just stay calm and do the, you know, he's excited for that race.
[01:03:13] Gerard Donnelly: Yeah, it seems to be like his main thing.
[01:03:16] Abby Jorgensen: So very good.
[01:03:17] Abby Jorgensen: Aaron, Aaron, she got back on her bike yesterday.
[01:03:24] Abby Jorgensen: What happened to her?
[01:03:26] Gerard Donnelly: I can't remember.
[01:03:27] Gerard Donnelly: Hip injury.
[01:03:29] Abby Jorgensen: So we're slowly getting back into it.
[01:03:33] Abby Jorgensen: Yeah.
[01:03:37] Gerard Donnelly: And has that, what's her hip being caused from?
[01:03:41] Abby Jorgensen: Bone spurs or like a hip spur.
[01:03:43] Abby Jorgensen: Yeah, OK.
[01:03:46] Abby Jorgensen: So, I mean, the doctor thinks it's been there for a while, but we think the bike initially, like her seat got moved and that nobody told her when she took her bike in.
[01:03:56] Abby Jorgensen: So we think initially like a bike fit caused, caused juice.
[01:04:00] Gerard Donnelly: Yes, OK.
[01:04:02] Gerard Donnelly: So that's resolved, has she got a proper bike fit?
[01:04:05] Abby Jorgensen: Yeah, and then she's been going to therapy and doing some extra strength stuff.
[01:04:11] Abby Jorgensen: Everything's starting to feel.
[01:04:14] Abby Jorgensen: She's had, like, even a run analysis.
[01:04:16] Abby Jorgensen: It's that way.
[01:04:18] Gerard Donnelly: Yep.
[01:04:20] Gerard Donnelly: Okay.
[01:04:21] Gerard Donnelly: Riley?
[01:04:22] Gerard Donnelly: She's doing good.
[01:04:26] Abby Jorgensen: Just a normal.
[01:04:29] Abby Jorgensen: Sorry, I mentioned it quite slow.
[01:04:34] Gerard Donnelly: Okay, what's he racing for?
[01:04:38] Gerard Donnelly: He has a gravel race and then Ironman Texas.
[01:04:46] Abby Jorgensen: Yeah.
[01:04:47] Abby Jorgensen: Yeah, great.
[01:04:48] Gerard Donnelly: So he's, he tested the other week.
[01:04:51] Gerard Donnelly: We talked about him.
[01:04:52] Gerard Donnelly: That's great.
[01:04:52] Gerard Donnelly: Yeah, he's just in another block of training.
[01:04:55] Abby Jorgensen: Is he going all right?
[01:04:57] Gerard Donnelly: Yep.
[01:05:01] Gerard Donnelly: Oh, no.
[01:05:15] Gerard Donnelly: Oh, it's really slow.
[01:05:21] Gerard Donnelly: Oh, he's way above.
[01:05:23] Gerard Donnelly: I know, I told him that.
[01:05:25] Abby Jorgensen: He's like, feeling good.
[01:05:26] Abby Jorgensen: I was like, okay, well, just, just, no.
[01:05:30] Gerard Donnelly: Yeah, and then maybe...
[01:05:32] Abby Jorgensen: I just started, mean, some of his tests are too, like he started really conservative in the last FTP.
[01:05:38] Gerard Donnelly: Yeah, maybe Abby, how did he go in the five minutes?
[01:05:41] Gerard Donnelly: This is an example where you would say, okay, let's just increase your FTP.
[01:05:48] Gerard Donnelly: Yeah, yeah, I think you need to, I think you need to up it a bit.
[01:05:57] Gerard Donnelly: It's too easy for him.
[01:06:01] Gerard Donnelly: Yeah, okay.
[01:06:02] Gerard Donnelly: Um, what was his, what was his FTP, was Raleigh, so he's just done the one, he's done a few, hasn't he?
[01:06:19] Gerard Donnelly: Yeah.
[01:06:21] Abby Jorgensen: He's got it, his FTP is 180.
[01:06:23] Gerard Donnelly: Yeah.
[01:06:34] Gerard Donnelly: It's, it's amazing it, is there something not right there, it, it's a big jump and he's doing it easy.
[01:06:43] Gerard Donnelly: He's gone from 160 to 180.
[01:06:46] Gerard Donnelly: Well, the one was on his gravel bike and then he got the TT bike.
[01:06:50] Gerard Donnelly: Yeah.
[01:06:53] Gerard Donnelly: Yeah, which one was the gravel, was it July the 3rd, 11th, is that gravel, was it?
[01:06:57] Abby Jorgensen: Yeah, and the latest one is his TT bike.
[01:07:00] Abby Jorgensen: Yeah.
[01:07:01] Abby Jorgensen: Yeah.
[01:07:01] Gerard Donnelly: Yeah.
[01:08:02] Gerard Donnelly: Are okay with that?
[01:08:16] Gerard Donnelly: How have you gone with Peter?
[01:08:19] Abby Jorgensen: Peter, he's being a lot more communicative and a lot more in tune to what he's doing.
[01:08:26] Abby Jorgensen: So I think whatever you said to him, it might have helped.
[01:08:38] Gerard Donnelly: Is that a workout error?
[01:08:42] Gerard Donnelly: Can you open it on yours?
[01:08:48] Gerard Donnelly: Yes.
[01:08:50] Gerard Donnelly: Oh, good.
[01:08:52] Abby Jorgensen: I got it.
[01:08:55] Gerard Donnelly: Okay.
[01:09:00] Gerard Donnelly: In nearly 60 minutes.
[01:09:02] Gerard Donnelly: right.
[01:09:02] Gerard Donnelly: All
[01:09:02] Gerard Donnelly: PB.
[01:09:05] Gerard Donnelly: We're doing something right, Abby.
[01:09:08] Abby Jorgensen: Right.
[01:09:12] Gerard Donnelly: So he hasn't done one before, but 278.
[01:09:16] Gerard Donnelly: Did he do it?
[01:09:17] Gerard Donnelly: He did it indoor.
[01:09:19] Gerard Donnelly: Damn.
[01:09:20] Gerard Donnelly: Damn.
[01:09:22] Gerard Donnelly: Why did he do it indoor?
[01:09:24] Gerard Donnelly: He didn't.
[01:09:25] Abby Jorgensen: So he said, oh, he texted me.
[01:09:29] Abby Jorgensen: And he's like, don't know why my bike computer didn't have the data from outside.
[01:09:35] Abby Jorgensen: But I know he was outside because he was texting me that he had to fix a flat first and then he was going.
[01:09:41] Abby Jorgensen: So I know he did it outside, but then he immediately, he's like, I don't know why it's not coming up with the outdoor data.
[01:09:48] Gerard Donnelly: But he did it outside.
[01:09:51] Gerard Donnelly: Okay.
[01:09:52] Abby Jorgensen: He's going to the same course he was at last week or whatever.
[01:09:55] Gerard Donnelly: Fantastic.
[01:09:59] Gerard Donnelly: So 280.
[01:10:00] Gerard Donnelly: 280.
[01:10:07] Gerard Donnelly: 2.80.
[01:10:07] Gerard Donnelly: That's good.
[01:10:08] Gerard Donnelly: We just don't get the speed, you know, because it's weird that it's recorded, but not.
[01:10:15] Gerard Donnelly: I know.
[01:10:16] Abby Jorgensen: He's like, I swear I hit outdoor and then hit start on my computer.
[01:10:22] Abby Jorgensen: And then he's like, I don't know why it didn't save.
[01:10:26] Abby Jorgensen: It's a really good obsession.
[01:10:30] Gerard Donnelly: So you hit the race this week?
[01:10:32] Gerard Donnelly: Yep.
[01:10:33] Abby Jorgensen: Santa Cruz, yep.
[01:10:36] Gerard Donnelly: He ran 20 minutes off the bike.
[01:10:37] Gerard Donnelly: Fantastic.
[01:10:41] Gerard Donnelly: How did he test indoor?
[01:10:42] Gerard Donnelly: Because that was his big complaint, wasn't it?
[01:10:47] Abby Jorgensen: Yeah.
[01:10:50] Abby Jorgensen: It was about the same as last time.
[01:10:53] Abby Jorgensen: One walk more, but he said it felt better.
[01:10:57] Abby Jorgensen: Yeah.
[01:10:58] Abby Jorgensen: He took more notice of...
[01:11:00] Gerard Donnelly: Yeah.
[01:11:01] Gerard Donnelly: Yeah.
[01:11:01] Abby Jorgensen: Yeah.
[01:11:02] Abby Jorgensen: Yeah.
[01:11:02] Abby Jorgensen: Thank
[01:11:02] Abby Jorgensen: Yeah, he's actually, like, putting notes in and, like, telling me how he feels and stuff now, too.
[01:11:07] Gerard Donnelly: So it's helpful.
[01:11:09] Gerard Donnelly: His execution was really fantastic.
[01:11:13] Gerard Donnelly: That's why he felt better.
[01:11:14] Gerard Donnelly: Because before he wasn't taking any notice.
[01:11:16] Gerard Donnelly: That was his problem.
[01:11:18] Gerard Donnelly: That's great.
[01:11:22] Gerard Donnelly: I'm happy with that.
[01:11:25] Gerard Donnelly: And as long as he's communicating.
[01:11:27] Gerard Donnelly: Yeah, that's a big step forward, too.
[01:11:35] Gerard Donnelly: Yeah, so hopefully he gets his run in today.
[01:11:37] Gerard Donnelly: It's a little bit late now, isn't it?
[01:11:39] Gerard Donnelly: No, it's California.
[01:11:41] Abby Jorgensen: It's only 5 o'clock, so I don't know.
[01:11:42] Abby Jorgensen: He usually does his stuff later, so I don't know.
[01:11:45] Gerard Donnelly: Okay.
[01:11:49] Gerard Donnelly: Good.
[01:11:50] Gerard Donnelly: All right.
[01:11:51] Gerard Donnelly: Are you confident with his race plan?
[01:11:54] Gerard Donnelly: Yeah.
[01:11:54] Abby Jorgensen: I haven't sat down and scheduled a call for them, but I'm going to try to do it early this week because of everything.
[01:12:01] Abby Jorgensen: don't don't know.
[01:12:01] Abby Jorgensen: I don't
[01:12:02] Abby Jorgensen: Going on, too.
[01:12:03] Abby Jorgensen: It's the last day at the gym on Thursday.
[01:12:08] Gerard Donnelly: This Thursday or last Thursday?
[01:12:11] Gerard Donnelly: This Thursday is my last coaching at the gym.
[01:12:14] Gerard Donnelly: I actually thought you'd already finished.
[01:12:17] Gerard Donnelly: No.
[01:12:19] Abby Jorgensen: It feels like it's dragging out, but yeah, this is our last week.
[01:12:25] Gerard Donnelly: It's crazy.
[01:12:28] Abby Jorgensen: Kristen?
[01:12:29] Gerard Donnelly: Kristen, she's already in Japan.
[01:12:33] Abby Jorgensen: And so, yeah, I just, she's there till the 8th, so there's not much I can do.
[01:12:41] Abby Jorgensen: She's just going to start riding on Monday or tomorrow.
[01:12:46] Gerard Donnelly: And what's her goal?
[01:12:48] Gerard Donnelly: What is she?
[01:12:49] Gerard Donnelly: She just wants to ride for fun.
[01:12:52] Abby Jorgensen: She wants to do all these, like, riding tours and stuff.
[01:12:55] Abby Jorgensen: I mean, she said once this gets done and it gets to be winter, which is, you know, not far off here, Oh, sure.
[01:13:02] Abby Jorgensen: What's
[01:13:02] Abby Jorgensen: She to refocus some stuff, so I've been trying, you know, in contact with her and just trying to get her to, like, be, she just didn't want, like, too, too tight of a schedule because she's just a free spirit person, I think.
[01:13:20] Abby Jorgensen: So it's hard to get her to, like, follow a schedule.
[01:13:23] Abby Jorgensen: She'll, like, do stuff, but it's, like, not on the days that I program or.
[01:13:27] Abby Jorgensen: Sure.
[01:13:29] Gerard Donnelly: If she doesn't want to do the program, she's going to be difficult to coach.
[01:13:36] Gerard Donnelly: Yeah.
[01:13:38] Abby Jorgensen: She's, like, she's a nice person and whatever, but she just, yeah, she's, like, I just don't want, like, a tight schedule, and I want to be able to do things.
[01:13:45] Abby Jorgensen: If it's a nice day, I can go ride.
[01:13:47] Abby Jorgensen: And I'm, like, I get that.
[01:13:50] Gerard Donnelly: So the things you can help her with is, so I've got a guy who rides 30 hours a week, and he just rides his bike.
[01:14:01] Gerard Donnelly: And so I've actually.
[01:14:02] Gerard Donnelly: I'm convinced him that on a Monday and Friday, if it's a beautiful day and he wants to go for a ride like normal, ride seven days a week, just make the Monday and Friday the easiest possible ride that you can do.
[01:14:16] Gerard Donnelly: And don't try to make it long.
[01:14:18] Gerard Donnelly: Try to make it around that one to one and a half hour ride.
[01:14:22] Gerard Donnelly: And then Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday, you should be riding with intensity on Tuesday, some intensity on Thursday when you're out doing your lovely ride.
[01:14:30] Gerard Donnelly: And so in Japan, I'll be saying to her, you should be doing this process.
[01:14:35] Gerard Donnelly: You should be riding Tuesday and Thursday.
[01:14:38] Gerard Donnelly: Go for it.
[01:14:39] Gerard Donnelly: Ride as hard as you like.
[01:14:40] Gerard Donnelly: You know, be a free spirit.
[01:14:42] Gerard Donnelly: Ride as hard and as long as you like.
[01:14:44] Gerard Donnelly: Monday and Friday, go for a ride, but take it easy.
[01:14:48] Gerard Donnelly: Wednesday, another easy day, but in between Tuesday and Thursday, not like Monday and Friday.
[01:14:55] Gerard Donnelly: So Monday is easy.
[01:14:56] Gerard Donnelly: Tuesday is hard.
[01:14:57] Gerard Donnelly: Wednesday is tempo.
[01:14:59] Gerard Donnelly: Thursday is hard.
[01:14:59] Gerard Donnelly: Friday is easy.
[01:15:00] Gerard Donnelly: And you can go as.
[01:15:03] Gerard Donnelly: You're not even giving her the sessions.
[01:15:05] Gerard Donnelly: You're just giving her the intensity range.
[01:15:07] Gerard Donnelly: Do you know what I'm saying?
[01:15:09] Gerard Donnelly: And then Saturday, another day where she can ride six hours if she wanted, you know, and then an easy day on Sunday.
[01:15:18] Gerard Donnelly: So this is the way I coach this guy.
[01:15:20] Gerard Donnelly: And he's just absolutely smashing it now.
[01:15:24] Gerard Donnelly: Whereas he just used to ride the same every day.
[01:15:26] Gerard Donnelly: He just ride long and hard every day.
[01:15:29] Gerard Donnelly: And it's like someone who's had a heart attack and just plateaued.
[01:15:34] Gerard Donnelly: You know, there's no rise or fall in.
[01:15:38] Gerard Donnelly: So, you know, that would be a coaching thing I'd be saying to her.
[01:15:43] Gerard Donnelly: I'd say, Kristen, we can help you with, you know, you just don't, even though you want to feel like you want to go riding today, work out what you did yesterday in the last three days and what's going to happen in the next three days to determine how you go about the day's ride.
[01:15:59] Gerard Donnelly: You know, and, and, and to get you.
[01:16:02] Gerard Donnelly: It's based around that, around I'm allowed to write as long as I want, as long as I'm not writing hard every day.
[01:16:10] Gerard Donnelly: And I'm not writing easy.
[01:16:11] Gerard Donnelly: Writing easy every day is worse.
[01:16:14] Gerard Donnelly: It's just a waste of time.
[01:16:17] Gerard Donnelly: Writing hard every day is going to make you fatigue so much that you can't actually write.
[01:16:20] Gerard Donnelly: So does that make sense?
[01:16:22] Gerard Donnelly: Yep.
[01:16:24] Gerard Donnelly: Okay.
[01:16:25] Gerard Donnelly: Uh, Dan?
[01:16:30] Gerard Donnelly: Doing good.
[01:16:32] Abby Jorgensen: Retesting this week.
[01:16:40] Gerard Donnelly: I don't know what he's going off like.
[01:16:50] Gerard Donnelly: What's his, what's his next event?
[01:16:52] Abby Jorgensen: He has a sprint, uh, in two weeks.
[01:16:55] Abby Jorgensen: Okay.
[01:16:57] Gerard Donnelly: And he's happy?
[01:16:58] Gerard Donnelly: Communicating okay?
[01:16:59] Gerard Donnelly: Yep.
[01:17:00] Gerard Donnelly: He's really happy.
[01:17:01] Abby Jorgensen: Everything's good.
[01:17:02] Abby Jorgensen: Going really well.
[01:17:07] Gerard Donnelly: What sort of a runner is he, Abby?
[01:17:10] Gerard Donnelly: He's a good runner, yeah.
[01:17:11] Abby Jorgensen: He's like a, I don't know, a six, 15-minute mile.
[01:17:17] Abby Jorgensen: So that's, what, 4.15, 4.30.
[01:17:22] Gerard Donnelly: Yeah, fantastic.
[01:17:24] Gerard Donnelly: Yeah, that's great.
[01:17:25] Gerard Donnelly: Yeah.
[01:17:26] Gerard Donnelly: And he's about the only guy who could handle 1K intervals.
[01:17:30] Gerard Donnelly: So I just worry about athletes who aren't good enough to run 1K intervals without getting injured.
[01:17:41] Gerard Donnelly: So the Fartlek and the 1Ks are only for guys like him, okay?
[01:17:46] Gerard Donnelly: Okay.
[01:17:47] Gerard Donnelly: I don't know, you made me do them, so.
[01:17:50] Abby Jorgensen: What was that?
[01:17:51] Abby Jorgensen: I said you made me do them.
[01:17:53] Gerard Donnelly: Yes.
[01:17:54] Gerard Donnelly: Because you need to experience those sessions to learn how to coach.
[01:18:00] Gerard Donnelly: Yeah, I know.
[01:18:01] Gerard Donnelly: know.
[01:18:04] Gerard Donnelly: And Nancy, she just got back the other day, whatever, you know, she improved with the, with the, she has actually, if look at today's or that session, or.
[01:18:24] Gerard Donnelly: She loved going out to Harvey, didn't she?
[01:18:26] Gerard Donnelly: Yeah.
[01:18:30] Gerard Donnelly: A lot more pressure on the pedals, look at that.
[01:18:33] Abby Jorgensen: Yeah, she did a lot better, even to, yes, yesterday's session back in Colorado was the best I've seen her do.
[01:18:49] Gerard Donnelly: Oh, she's slow, isn't she?
[01:18:51] Gerard Donnelly: Oh my goodness.
[01:18:52] Gerard Donnelly: Yeah.
[01:18:58] Gerard Donnelly: Oh, yeah, she picked up a bit quicker there.
[01:19:00] Gerard Donnelly: So today was good, you said?
[01:19:02] Gerard Donnelly: Yes.
[01:19:08] Gerard Donnelly: Was she on the flat there, was she?
[01:19:10] Abby Jorgensen: As flat as she can get in California.
[01:19:16] Gerard Donnelly: 200 meters, that's great.
[01:19:18] Gerard Donnelly: Geez, that's, ah.
[01:19:20] Gerard Donnelly: Right?
[01:19:21] Gerard Donnelly: I was like, where's that been?
[01:19:23] Abby Jorgensen: She just got ragged, didn't she, at the end.
[01:19:25] Abby Jorgensen: She said she got tired, but she's not used to doing, she has Santa Cruz, and I try to make her go a little harder than what she's been used to, and she, she's got so much less time now.
[01:19:42] Abby Jorgensen: She's still doing too much here.
[01:19:45] Gerard Donnelly: So she's averaging 134.
[01:19:50] Gerard Donnelly: That's really good.
[01:19:53] Gerard Donnelly: She should be commended on that.
[01:19:56] Abby Jorgensen: Yeah, we had a talk.
[01:19:57] Abby Jorgensen: I was like, that's finally here.
[01:20:00] Abby Jorgensen: sir.
[01:20:01] Abby Jorgensen: Thank You
[01:20:02] Abby Jorgensen: I don't know what it took.
[01:20:03] Abby Jorgensen: I don't know what I said.
[01:20:07] Gerard Donnelly: Yeah, it's just constantly reminding them about keeping the chain tight and, you know, not freewheeling, you know.
[01:20:15] Gerard Donnelly: And she knows we can see.
[01:20:16] Gerard Donnelly: That's, I think, I think the penny's dropping that, you know, if she doesn't change it, she's going to be the same  rider.
[01:20:25] Gerard Donnelly: That's fantastic.
[01:20:28] Gerard Donnelly: Right?
[01:20:28] Gerard Donnelly: Coaching.
[01:20:31] Gerard Donnelly: You know, it's the second best 90 minutes.
[01:20:36] Gerard Donnelly: You know, even her speed's about far out.
[01:20:40] Gerard Donnelly: She starts there.
[01:20:43] Gerard Donnelly: She pretty much finishes there, so that's really good.
[01:20:49] Gerard Donnelly: She's nearly getting to 17 miles an hour.
[01:20:54] Gerard Donnelly: Right?
[01:20:56] Gerard Donnelly: Yeah.
[01:20:58] Gerard Donnelly: Did she run off the bike?
[01:21:01] Abby Jorgensen: I mean...
[01:21:09] Gerard Donnelly: What are you doing dog?
[01:21:15] Gerard Donnelly: The dog, I've got my towel underneath my training mat.
[01:21:19] Gerard Donnelly: It's weird to catch any sweat.
[01:21:22] Gerard Donnelly: And she just, she wraps it up and then she sits on it.
[01:21:28] Gerard Donnelly: I mean, mine do weird things like that too.
[01:21:31] Gerard Donnelly: You can see what she's doing.
[01:21:35] Gerard Donnelly: Yeah.
[01:21:40] Gerard Donnelly: That's great.
[01:21:42] Gerard Donnelly: She's not stopping now on these runs.
[01:21:44] Gerard Donnelly: She's slow, but she's not stopping.
[01:21:46] Gerard Donnelly: Before she had all these stops.
[01:21:49] Gerard Donnelly: Yeah, she's back in Colorado, so she was cooler too.
[01:21:52] Gerard Donnelly: Yeah, she's really, you know, that's terrific.
[01:21:55] Gerard Donnelly: All right.
[01:21:57] Gerard Donnelly: Good perseverance, Abby, on you.
[01:22:01] Gerard Donnelly: She wanted to send
[01:22:02] Abby Jorgensen: A carbon wheels, but it was like, like $400 shipping from Colorado to Iowa.
[01:22:10] Abby Jorgensen: We were like, that's crazy.
[01:22:13] Abby Jorgensen: $400?
[01:22:14] Gerard Donnelly: $400 to ship carbon wheels.
[01:22:16] Abby Jorgensen: You were going to borrow them from it?
[01:22:19] Gerard Donnelly: Yeah.
[01:22:19] Abby Jorgensen: And then $400 shipping were like, nah, I'm like, I'm good.
[01:22:28] Gerard Donnelly: How's Bill going?
[01:22:30] Gerard Donnelly: Good.
[01:22:31] Abby Jorgensen: Besides, he's finally going to go to the doctor this week for his foot.
[01:22:36] Abby Jorgensen: Because he hasn't been, he tried to run yesterday and he still feels pain.
[01:22:41] Abby Jorgensen: So I'm like, you need to go to the doctor.
[01:22:42] Abby Jorgensen: So he's in a lot of riding, like his riding's sometimes indoors because they've had a lot of rain and had a hurricane through there.
[01:22:53] Abby Jorgensen: But where's he live?
[01:22:55] Abby Jorgensen: North Carolina, South Carolina, North Carolina.
[01:22:58] Abby Jorgensen: Yeah.
[01:23:00] Gerard Donnelly: Yeah, we'll just keep pushing.
[01:23:02] Gerard Donnelly: The bike.
[01:23:03] Gerard Donnelly: So if he's not able to run, you need him to be doing five rides a week, Abby, okay?
[01:23:12] Gerard Donnelly: Yep.
[01:23:13] Gerard Donnelly: So how you would do it is you'd probably do the Zone 2 here, Recovery Ride, High Intensity here, which is correct.
[01:23:29] Gerard Donnelly: That's correct.
[01:23:30] Gerard Donnelly: And then add another ride here in Zone, one of these.
[01:23:34] Gerard Donnelly: Yeah.
[01:23:35] Gerard Donnelly: So you want to have three rides and two rides.
[01:23:40] Gerard Donnelly: Okay.
[01:23:41] Abby Jorgensen: Yeah, we just did it day by day last week, and I just entered some stuff as we figured out how we were doing.
[01:23:51] Abby Jorgensen: So I stayed a day with him.
[01:23:53] Abby Jorgensen: Yeah, all right.
[01:23:57] Gerard Donnelly: Anything else you want to go through?
[01:23:58] Gerard Donnelly: And so work's finishing on Thursday.
[01:24:02] Gerard Donnelly: next day.
[01:24:06] Gerard Donnelly: And then you're going to start with the daycare?
[01:24:10] Gerard Donnelly: Yep.
[01:24:10] Gerard Donnelly: I'm not starting there until the 22nd, so I'll have a couple weeks off.
[01:24:14] Gerard Donnelly: Great.
[01:24:15] Gerard Donnelly: Okay.
[01:24:18] Gerard Donnelly: That'll be a sad week for you.
[01:24:20] Abby Jorgensen: Yeah, it's going to be like an emotional, between the Ironman and the end of this, it's going to be a...
[01:24:27] Gerard Donnelly: Yep.
[01:24:28] Gerard Donnelly: But, yeah.
[01:24:29] Abby Jorgensen: It sure will.
[01:24:35] Gerard Donnelly: It's sort of bad timing, isn't it, really?
[01:24:39] Gerard Donnelly: Yeah.
[01:24:45] Gerard Donnelly: Yeah, it's going to be...
[01:24:47] Abby Jorgensen: Yeah, it'll be a hard week, but a good week.
[01:24:52] Abby Jorgensen: A lot of things come to an end, I guess.
[01:24:57] Gerard Donnelly: So, finish on Thursday, then you drive up on Friday.
[01:25:01] Gerard Donnelly: Yep.
[01:25:02] Abby Jorgensen: Yep.
[01:25:02] Abby Jorgensen: Yep, okay.
[01:25:06] Gerard Donnelly: So this week, we kind of want to keep a little, you know, just a little bit of intensity, really easy run, really easy ride, you know, just, you can do whatever you like.
[01:25:23] Abby Jorgensen: Well, with Wednesday, I don't know when I'm going to get my, I'm my bike in Tuesday.
[01:25:27] Abby Jorgensen: I don't know when I'm going to get it back on Wednesday.
[01:25:30] Abby Jorgensen: He said Wednesday sometime.
[01:25:31] Abby Jorgensen: Yep.
[01:25:33] Abby Jorgensen: So I might need to, I mean, I could do an easy run on Wednesday.
[01:25:37] Abby Jorgensen: If you do, if you can't get the bike back, don't run off the bike on Tuesday.
[01:25:41] Gerard Donnelly: Okay.
[01:25:42] Gerard Donnelly: Do the easy run on Wednesday.
[01:25:47] Gerard Donnelly: Yeah.
[01:25:48] Gerard Donnelly: So 30 minutes is fine.
[01:25:50] Gerard Donnelly: You know, I'll, no, actually, we don't want you to run two days in a row.
[01:25:55] Gerard Donnelly: So if I can get that to move.
[01:25:59] Abby Jorgensen: I'm guessing this was my schedule too, and how Wednesday's.
[01:26:02] Abby Jorgensen: It's going to be a run, a short run would probably be the easiest thing to get in.
[01:26:08] Abby Jorgensen: Yep.
[01:26:09] Gerard Donnelly: I don't know.
[01:26:10] Gerard Donnelly: Well, I won't move.
[01:26:11] Gerard Donnelly: Sorry.
[01:26:12] Abby Jorgensen: No, you're fine.
[01:26:13] Abby Jorgensen: I can.
[01:26:14] Gerard Donnelly: Once we hang up, won't fix it.
[01:26:17] Gerard Donnelly: But yeah, if you don't get the bike back, then do the run.
[01:26:21] Gerard Donnelly: Don't do the run on Tuesday or Thursday.
[01:26:24] Gerard Donnelly: I don't know why it moved to there.
[01:26:26] Gerard Donnelly: I don't understand what's going on.
[01:26:28] Gerard Donnelly: I can't do anything.
[01:26:29] Gerard Donnelly: Anyway, so we don't want to run back to back.
[01:26:34] Gerard Donnelly: So Wednesday, Friday run, Tuesday ride, and Thursday ride.
[01:26:41] Gerard Donnelly: And there should be a ride on Saturday.
[01:26:43] Gerard Donnelly: I don't know why it's not there.
[01:26:44] Gerard Donnelly: Sorry.
[01:26:45] Gerard Donnelly: It should be a there on Saturday.
[01:26:46] Gerard Donnelly: Okay.
[01:26:47] Gerard Donnelly: I'll fix that up once we hang up.
[01:26:48] Gerard Donnelly: Okay.
[01:26:52] Gerard Donnelly: Really concentrate on your nutrition this week.
[01:26:56] Gerard Donnelly: Try to get as much sleep as you can.
[01:26:58] Gerard Donnelly: Yeah.
[01:26:59] Gerard Donnelly: If possible.
[01:27:01] Gerard Donnelly: Yeah.
[01:27:02] Gerard Donnelly: Yeah.
[01:27:02] Abby Jorgensen: I'll in tomorrow because it's a holiday, so I don't have any work.
[01:27:08] Gerard Donnelly: You can swim outdoors if you want.
[01:27:10] Gerard Donnelly: It doesn't have to be indoors.
[01:27:12] Abby Jorgensen: Yeah, haven't been indoors for a while.
[01:27:14] Abby Jorgensen: Yeah, just keep swimming outdoors.
[01:27:16] Gerard Donnelly: That's fine.
[01:27:19] Gerard Donnelly: But, yeah, try to do some shorter stuff, Abby.
[01:27:21] Gerard Donnelly: Don't try and do continuous swimming.
[01:27:23] Gerard Donnelly: Try to do some shorter stuff where you might be doing 200s.
[01:27:27] Abby Jorgensen: That's about the distance, like there and back in the little area.
[01:27:31] Abby Jorgensen: Good.
[01:27:32] Gerard Donnelly: So do six to eight of those, you know.
[01:27:35] Gerard Donnelly: So you try to swim under 1.5 miles, something like that.
[01:27:44] Gerard Donnelly: Okay.
[01:27:47] Gerard Donnelly: All right.
[01:27:48] Gerard Donnelly: Okay.
[01:27:51] Gerard Donnelly: And we need to catch up towards the end of the week with your plan.
[01:27:55] Gerard Donnelly: So send that through as you normally would.
[01:27:59] Gerard Donnelly: Yep.
[01:28:01] Gerard Donnelly: Anybody else you need help with, just
[01:28:02] Gerard Donnelly: Just keep using the WhatsApp.
[01:28:06] Gerard Donnelly: Yep.
[01:28:08] Gerard Donnelly: I've got some interviews coming up, which hopefully we can add some more athletes to you.
[01:28:18] Gerard Donnelly: But I've got three tomorrow, three interviews tomorrow.
[01:28:21] Gerard Donnelly: So we'll see a couple of them are in Australia, so they won't be good.
[01:28:26] Gerard Donnelly: But there's a couple in the US as well.
[01:28:28] Gerard Donnelly: So we need to replace Dre for you.
[01:28:34] Gerard Donnelly: We can get you up to that 20 as soon as possible.
[01:28:41] Gerard Donnelly: Yeah, I was at 19 and then now Dre.
[01:28:44] Gerard Donnelly: So yeah, 18 now.
[01:28:46] Gerard Donnelly: We'll see what we can do.
