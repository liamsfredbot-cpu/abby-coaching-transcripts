## Transcript

[00:00:00] Gerard Donnelly: She's Hong Kong, a girl, Libby, and I signed her up on Friday and then didn't hear from her and then had to have another hour call with her on the weekend.
[00:00:12] Gerard Donnelly: She signed up on Friday, then didn't hear from her, so I rang her up and she had more questions, so I went through it again and then signed her up again and then she sent me a message yesterday saying she's selected some other coaching group.
[00:00:29] Gerard Donnelly: It was bizarre.
[00:00:31] Gerard Donnelly: That's very bizarre.
[00:00:33] Abby Jorgensen: Like, why waste your time?
[00:00:40] Gerard Donnelly: So James was someone that I didn't think that we would, he's never done a triathlon, he's a runner and done a bit of swimming.
[00:00:48] Gerard Donnelly: He doesn't actually own a bike, so I thought today was only going to be, you know, what do I need to do to be a triathlete?
[00:00:56] Gerard Donnelly: So, in the end, he's really good.
[00:00:59] Gerard Donnelly: He's to get going.
[00:01:01] Gerard Donnelly: He actually bought a bike yesterday.
[00:01:03] Gerard Donnelly: So that was between his application.
[00:01:06] Gerard Donnelly: So he bought a road bike, a giant TCR, which is fine.
[00:01:10] Gerard Donnelly: So I've got him, you he has to go and buy a power meter.
[00:01:13] Gerard Donnelly: He has to go and buy a bike computer.
[00:01:16] Gerard Donnelly: I said he needs a lot of kicker.
[00:01:17] Gerard Donnelly: He lives in London.
[00:01:18] Gerard Donnelly: It's the middle of winter.
[00:01:21] Gerard Donnelly: And he doesn't have cycling shoes.
[00:01:23] Gerard Donnelly: So there's four things he needs to go.
[00:01:24] Gerard Donnelly: He's really keen.
[00:01:25] Gerard Donnelly: He's asking me when should I start after I get all this stuff in a couple of weeks.
[00:01:29] Gerard Donnelly: I'm saying, James, no, you just need to get it as soon as possible.
[00:01:33] Gerard Donnelly: I know your race is in September, 70.3.
[00:01:36] Gerard Donnelly: You know, you've never done a race before.
[00:01:39] Gerard Donnelly: Every, you know, every week counts.
[00:01:41] Gerard Donnelly: People think, oh, September's miles away.
[00:01:43] Gerard Donnelly: It is miles away.
[00:01:45] Gerard Donnelly: But it gets there quickly.
[00:01:47] Gerard Donnelly: And you haven't ridden a bike.
[00:01:49] Gerard Donnelly: So, you know, he's a solicitor.
[00:01:52] Gerard Donnelly: He works, I think it's a 15 minute commute to the gym he goes to.
[00:01:57] Gerard Donnelly: The gym has a pool and it has indoor And you've
[00:02:00] Gerard Donnelly: Training bike and it has treadmill.
[00:02:02] Gerard Donnelly: So he's got a few set things he's already doing.
[00:02:06] Gerard Donnelly: So he just rides the gym bike and he's got, now I've explained to him about power and stuff.
[00:02:12] Gerard Donnelly: He doesn't need to do that.
[00:02:14] Gerard Donnelly: He can do that at home.
[00:02:15] Gerard Donnelly: But he uses the gym for the swimming sessions.
[00:02:17] Gerard Donnelly: He's got a coach there that's helping him.
[00:02:20] Gerard Donnelly: He's no mugger as a swimmer.
[00:02:21] Gerard Donnelly: Like he can swim 140s, 150s.
[00:02:24] Gerard Donnelly: So he did do a little bit of swimming growing up.
[00:02:27] Gerard Donnelly: So I'm just giving you a bit of an insight.
[00:02:29] Gerard Donnelly: You'll see all this in the video anyway.
[00:02:32] Gerard Donnelly: And he's run a 307 marathon, Abby, and he's run a 126 half.
[00:02:37] Gerard Donnelly: And he used that runner app and basically told him he could run a sub three hour.
[00:02:42] Gerard Donnelly: And I said to him, you have to be able to run a 123 half to be able to run a three hour marathon.
[00:02:49] Gerard Donnelly: It's another example of these crappy apps that, you know, he was quite frustrated that he ran 307 and but he was never going to do it.
[00:03:00] Gerard Donnelly: With that time.
[00:03:02] Gerard Donnelly: So he's quite confident in his running, but he's willing to listen, which is going to be good.
[00:03:11] Gerard Donnelly: And he admits he's new and he just wants to know what to do.
[00:03:14] Gerard Donnelly: So I went through explaining what power is and he had no understanding of any of it.
[00:03:19] Gerard Donnelly: What an FTP is, how much testing we do.
[00:03:23] Gerard Donnelly: He's really loving the fact that we test.
[00:03:25] Gerard Donnelly: So rather than having someone pushing back on testing, we've got someone embracing it.
[00:03:30] Gerard Donnelly: So I think, I think initially it'll be a, it'll be a little bit of, you know, really helping.
[00:03:37] Gerard Donnelly: But, but he, you know, he's obviously no dummy.
[00:03:41] Gerard Donnelly: He's a solicitor.
[00:03:42] Gerard Donnelly: So I'm sure he'll be able to pick it up quickly.
[00:03:48] Gerard Donnelly: So, yeah, once he gets the information back to us, then, and I've given him my WhatsApp phone number, if he's got any questions, because he's going to have questions about purchasing the power meter, the.
[00:04:00] Gerard Donnelly: Garmin, bike computer, the kicker, you know, but I'm just saying to him, you know, just do your research and then if you've got questions, ask us.
[00:04:09] Gerard Donnelly: But we're not researching it for you.
[00:04:16] Gerard Donnelly: So, yeah.
[00:04:18] Gerard Donnelly: That's perfect.
[00:04:20] Gerard Donnelly: I don't think there's anything else that I need to tell you about him.
[00:04:23] Gerard Donnelly: Um, he's, he's got, I think he's got, uh, three swim sessions, three runs, and three gym, two gym bike sessions.
[00:04:33] Gerard Donnelly: So I'm going to be saying to him, you know, we need to spend a lot of time on the bike here, James.
[00:04:39] Gerard Donnelly: So let's, let's try to keep the two, push the swims back to two.
[00:04:44] Gerard Donnelly: Um, you know, that's, he's, you know, he's used to, the running load he's used to.
[00:04:50] Gerard Donnelly: Um, but once I start riding, I had a couple of guys who are really good runners.
[00:04:55] Gerard Donnelly: I'm talking 36 minute, 10K runners.
[00:04:58] Gerard Donnelly: And I hadn't ridden a bike.
[00:05:00] Gerard Donnelly: When they started riding the bike, they were really sore running.
[00:05:03] Gerard Donnelly: It was a real shock to me.
[00:05:04] Gerard Donnelly: I'd never seen that.
[00:05:06] Gerard Donnelly: It's happened to two people that are really good runners who don't ride.
[00:05:10] Gerard Donnelly: And as soon as I started giving them the VO2 and threshold sessions on the bike, their running legs kind of left them.
[00:05:18] Gerard Donnelly: They started getting sore and injured it.
[00:05:22] Gerard Donnelly: Saw quads, injuries in the quad strains.
[00:05:27] Gerard Donnelly: So they just, it was too much.
[00:05:29] Gerard Donnelly: So we've got to be super careful that we need, I didn't explain this to him, but we need to say to him, we're going to flip the running to just running with no intensity because he'd been running 340, 1K intervals on the treadmill, you know, 3 minute 40, which is what?
[00:05:46] Gerard Donnelly: 5, 5, 5 5 and a half, 5 and a half minute mile, 6, it's something like that.
[00:05:53] Gerard Donnelly: You know, it's quite fast running.
[00:05:56] Gerard Donnelly: We can't, I think the answer is early.
[00:06:00] Gerard Donnelly: 20 days, as a non-rider, you can't do high-intensity riding and running.
[00:06:05] Gerard Donnelly: You have to do one or the other until your body catches up.
[00:06:09] Gerard Donnelly: We have to explain to him that we're going to ride you hard, and then we've just got to get you to run.
[00:06:16] Gerard Donnelly: Just be consistent running, you know, where you're just doing aerobic runs with hardly any intensity.
[00:06:24] Gerard Donnelly: And one of the guys I'm talking about, Ben Morgan, I don't know if you've heard of Ben.
[00:06:30] Gerard Donnelly: Yeah, I think I even follow him on one of the apps.
[00:06:32] Gerard Donnelly: Yeah, Ben, he just did the race on the weekend.
[00:06:35] Gerard Donnelly: He got injured again.
[00:06:36] Gerard Donnelly: He's the guy who was a runner, and he's a really good runner.
[00:06:39] Gerard Donnelly: He's a 17-minute 5K runner.
[00:06:43] Gerard Donnelly: And the last five weeks since his last running injury, no running intensity.
[00:06:48] Gerard Donnelly: I've just given him 30, 40, 50, 60-minute easy runs and really worked him on the bike.
[00:06:55] Gerard Donnelly: At the race on the weekend, it was a 5K.
[00:06:57] Gerard Donnelly: I think he ran a PB.
[00:07:00] Gerard Donnelly: No running intensity.
[00:07:03] Gerard Donnelly: The proof's there every time.
[00:07:05] Gerard Donnelly: You don't necessarily have to run hard because you're getting the hard work from the bike.
[00:07:13] Abby Jorgensen: You have to do something with like an imbalance to start with in the hamstring or something.
[00:07:19] Gerard Donnelly: And then, I don't know.
[00:07:22] Gerard Donnelly: All I know is that's what happened and actually working out why, it's kind of a little bit cloudy.
[00:07:30] Gerard Donnelly: But all I know is I've got to take note of that and not make that mistake again.
[00:07:35] Gerard Donnelly: I did it with two people and Lachlan's the other guy I did it with.
[00:07:39] Gerard Donnelly: And now he's just running the same as Ben.
[00:07:42] Gerard Donnelly: He's not doing any hard running.
[00:07:45] Gerard Donnelly: And he did the Olympic distance last week and had he not gone the wrong way, he would have actually, I think he would have ended up getting third in the race.
[00:07:57] Gerard Donnelly: And he ran the 10K.
[00:07:59] Gerard Donnelly: would have
[00:08:00] Gerard Donnelly: He's a 38, 39.
[00:08:01] Gerard Donnelly: He's a 36 runner fresh.
[00:08:03] Gerard Donnelly: But all he's been doing is easy runs.
[00:08:05] Gerard Donnelly: And like before he did his first race, he ran 43.
[00:08:11] Gerard Donnelly: So that's in a space of eight months.
[00:08:13] Gerard Donnelly: He's gone from 43 to 39.
[00:08:16] Gerard Donnelly: And I haven't given him any intensity as a runner in that period after he got injured.
[00:08:22] Gerard Donnelly: So he's improved out of sight without running hard.
[00:08:27] Gerard Donnelly: I'm sorry.
[00:08:29] Gerard Donnelly: Okay.
[00:08:30] Gerard Donnelly: We better get into it, eh?
[00:08:32] Gerard Donnelly: Yeah.
[00:08:34] Gerard Donnelly: Yeah.
[00:08:35] Gerard Donnelly: So apologies for that.
[00:08:36] Gerard Donnelly: But no, it's fine.
[00:08:40] Gerard Donnelly: How are you doing?
[00:08:40] Gerard Donnelly: It's cold do anything in here, so.
[00:08:44] Gerard Donnelly: How are you doing?
[00:08:45] Gerard Donnelly: It's too cold.
[00:08:47] Abby Jorgensen: Negative 17 Celsius, it feels like here right now.
[00:08:50] Abby Jorgensen: Oh my God, Abby.
[00:08:54] Gerard Donnelly: You wouldn't last that long out there, would you?
[00:08:56] Gerard Donnelly: If you're out there?
[00:08:57] Gerard Donnelly: No, you can't really.
[00:08:59] Abby Jorgensen: Like, it's just, it hurts.
[00:09:00] Abby Jorgensen: It's the face just to walk outside to your car.
[00:09:02] Abby Jorgensen: Yeah.
[00:09:03] Gerard Donnelly: So people just go flat out from their car to the work or just cover everything up.
[00:09:13] Gerard Donnelly: Yeah.
[00:09:15] Abby Jorgensen: You get used to it a little bit, but it's, yeah, it's definitely a shock to the system.
[00:09:20] Abby Jorgensen: Yeah.
[00:09:22] Gerard Donnelly: I was looking at your week yesterday and it was great you did that.
[00:09:26] Gerard Donnelly: And I'm going to use, I'm going to use your little plan that you've done for other athletes.
[00:09:34] Gerard Donnelly: So well done.
[00:09:36] Gerard Donnelly: The only way to do it.
[00:09:38] Gerard Donnelly: Next week or the week after, I've kind of started to muck around with a, you can't see this, but I've kind of created a treadmill option based on what you did.
[00:09:49] Gerard Donnelly: Okay.
[00:09:50] Gerard Donnelly: Okay.
[00:09:51] Gerard Donnelly: So, oh, sorry.
[00:09:52] Gerard Donnelly: Anyway, so kind of like a warmup, then some strides, and then just do a section where.
[00:10:00] Gerard Donnelly: In your case, you'd be running like 8.
[00:10:06] Gerard Donnelly: You can take me straight away.
[00:10:09] Gerard Donnelly: I think like 8.30 to 9-minute miles.
[00:10:12] Gerard Donnelly: think that is.
[00:10:13] Gerard Donnelly: 5.18, yeah.
[00:10:17] Gerard Donnelly: Is it 8.30 miles pace, is it?
[00:10:20] Gerard Donnelly: It might be 8.30 to 9 minutes.
[00:10:23] Gerard Donnelly: Yeah, that's right.
[00:10:23] Gerard Donnelly: You're right.
[00:10:25] Gerard Donnelly: And then what did I do?
[00:10:29] Gerard Donnelly: Did I just muck that up?
[00:10:30] Gerard Donnelly: No.
[00:10:30] Gerard Donnelly: And then have a little break and then do another one.
[00:10:32] Gerard Donnelly: And then do 4.10s and then finish off with a strong, you know, at kind of as best as you can do, 4.40s, which is, you know, right on your team pace, I think.
[00:10:48] Gerard Donnelly: 4.40 is 7.30 pace, 7.30 mile pace.
[00:10:54] Gerard Donnelly: And that might be too hard, but I'm just still mucking around with it.
[00:10:58] Gerard Donnelly: Yeah.
[00:10:59] Gerard Donnelly: Definitely.
[00:10:59] Gerard Donnelly: Definitely.
[00:11:00] Abby Jorgensen: It made it go by faster.
[00:11:02] Abby Jorgensen: Yeah.
[00:11:03] Gerard Donnelly: Yeah.
[00:11:03] Gerard Donnelly: So you really made me think it was good.
[00:11:07] Gerard Donnelly: I need that.
[00:11:09] Gerard Donnelly: Oh, God.
[00:11:10] Gerard Donnelly: I've got stuff hidden here.
[00:11:12] Gerard Donnelly: Where am I doing?
[00:11:14] Gerard Donnelly: Sorry.
[00:11:14] Abby Jorgensen: I'm going to wait until you talk to me here.
[00:11:17] Abby Jorgensen: Can you see that?
[00:11:19] Gerard Donnelly: Yeah.
[00:11:19] Gerard Donnelly: Now.
[00:11:20] Gerard Donnelly: I mean, it's.
[00:11:23] Gerard Donnelly: Okay.
[00:11:26] Gerard Donnelly: So you coped okay during the week?
[00:11:29] Gerard Donnelly: Yeah.
[00:11:29] Gerard Donnelly: It was fine.
[00:11:30] Gerard Donnelly: Yeah.
[00:11:32] Gerard Donnelly: Interesting with your Garmin saying you did an extra distance, but you probably didn't.
[00:11:40] Gerard Donnelly: Yeah.
[00:11:40] Gerard Donnelly: I don't know.
[00:11:42] Abby Jorgensen: Yeah.
[00:11:44] Gerard Donnelly: How did you go with the Monop Heart Lake?
[00:11:46] Gerard Donnelly: you find it?
[00:11:49] Gerard Donnelly: felt fine.
[00:11:51] Abby Jorgensen: I wouldn't say it was easy, but it wasn't like super on the treadmill with those paces.
[00:11:57] Abby Jorgensen: Yeah.
[00:11:57] Abby Jorgensen: know with like briefly.
[00:11:59] Gerard Donnelly: Yeah.-hmm.
[00:11:59] Gerard Donnelly: the
[00:12:00] Gerard Donnelly: Did you find that it was pushing you too hard, Abby?
[00:12:02] Gerard Donnelly: No, I would probably say the opposite.
[00:12:05] Abby Jorgensen: Because I mean, two minutes, because when we were doing the five by six at that pace, like I was fine.
[00:12:11] Abby Jorgensen: So for two minutes, it really wasn't terrible, I guess.
[00:12:17] Gerard Donnelly: Okay.
[00:12:17] Gerard Donnelly: Yep.
[00:12:18] Gerard Donnelly: Yep.
[00:12:19] Gerard Donnelly: In those 15 seconds, I've given you a different one this week.
[00:12:22] Gerard Donnelly: So it's slightly different.
[00:12:25] Gerard Donnelly: Okay.
[00:12:26] Gerard Donnelly: Okay.
[00:12:27] Gerard Donnelly: Is it hard to keep it on changing the speed?
[00:12:30] Abby Jorgensen: No, I just anticipated a little bit and then changed it like five seconds before because it takes a little of row.
[00:12:38] Gerard Donnelly: And do you need the chart beside you to say what speed?
[00:12:41] Gerard Donnelly: Is that what you're using?
[00:12:43] Abby Jorgensen: Yeah, but I have it.
[00:12:44] Abby Jorgensen: I like write it down ahead of time and then I just remember what speeds I need to switch it to.
[00:12:49] Gerard Donnelly: Very clever.
[00:12:50] Gerard Donnelly: So coaching an athlete, would they need to have that written down next to them to say?
[00:12:55] Gerard Donnelly: Most people, yeah.
[00:12:56] Abby Jorgensen: Yeah, I've told some of my treadmill people, like some of it's in.
[00:13:00] Abby Jorgensen: I don't know how treadmills do it.
[00:13:02] Abby Jorgensen: Do your treadmills go kilometers per hour over there?
[00:13:05] Gerard Donnelly: Yeah, I think there must be a setting there, Abby, that you can do both, surely.
[00:13:09] Gerard Donnelly: I mean, maybe.
[00:13:11] Abby Jorgensen: I guess I've never looked into it.
[00:13:13] Gerard Donnelly: Mine just has miles.
[00:13:15] Abby Jorgensen: It has, like, a quick button.
[00:13:16] Abby Jorgensen: I can just hit seven or eight for miles an hour and then same with the incline.
[00:13:21] Gerard Donnelly: So I don't know.
[00:13:22] Gerard Donnelly: Yeah.
[00:13:23] Abby Jorgensen: Yeah, so it can't do eight and a half.
[00:13:25] Gerard Donnelly: It's just seven, eight, nine.
[00:13:27] Abby Jorgensen: It can do eight and a half.
[00:13:28] Abby Jorgensen: just has, like, a quick, like, I can go seven real quick and then I can hit the up button.
[00:13:34] Abby Jorgensen: then.
[00:13:35] Abby Jorgensen: How does it up?
[00:13:36] Gerard Donnelly: Does it go 7.1, 7.2, 7.3?
[00:13:38] Gerard Donnelly: Yeah, it goes up by ones or 0.1.
[00:13:40] Abby Jorgensen: Yeah, that's fantastic.
[00:13:42] Gerard Donnelly: So I'm trying to learn for these sessions.
[00:13:45] Gerard Donnelly: Maybe we need to say in the session, you need to have your miles per hour chart or kilometer per hour chart ready so that.
[00:13:57] Gerard Donnelly: So that when you're when you know.
[00:14:00] Gerard Donnelly: You're going to run 5.18 to 5.25.
[00:14:02] Gerard Donnelly: You've got that ready that's in kilometres per hour or miles per hour, 5.18.
[00:14:09] Gerard Donnelly: So 5.18 is 11.30 kilometre pace or seven mile pace.
[00:14:15] Gerard Donnelly: So they need to have that.
[00:14:18] Gerard Donnelly: Otherwise, you're going confuse the hell out of them.
[00:14:22] Gerard Donnelly: Yeah.
[00:14:23] Abby Jorgensen: Yeah, I mean, I just usually like tell, I mean, for me, I just looked it up what my paces were, went to that chart.
[00:14:28] Abby Jorgensen: And I was like, need be somewhere between these speeds.
[00:14:33] Abby Jorgensen: And I just kind of feel it out.
[00:14:35] Abby Jorgensen: I usually start low end and then build as I go.
[00:14:39] Abby Jorgensen: Yeah.
[00:14:40] Abby Jorgensen: Yeah.
[00:14:40] Gerard Donnelly: Okay.
[00:14:42] Gerard Donnelly: I was just thinking about, yeah, we just want to keep kicking the sessions off, Abby.
[00:14:48] Gerard Donnelly: And as you know, each week is getting, you know, we're just slightly up in the distance.
[00:14:54] Gerard Donnelly: And this is a little bit different with the Monofartlec now.
[00:14:57] Gerard Donnelly: So they're quite two different sessions.
[00:14:59] Gerard Donnelly: They should be.
[00:14:59] Gerard Donnelly: Yeah.
[00:14:59] Gerard Donnelly: So
[00:15:00] Gerard Donnelly: If I've got that wrong.
[00:15:02] Gerard Donnelly: So, and this week, we've just upped the intensity a little bit.
[00:15:07] Gerard Donnelly: You're at 98 to 102 this week, whereas last week you were 96 to 100, so a little bit more flexibility, okay?
[00:15:15] Gerard Donnelly: And the same with the run.
[00:15:16] Gerard Donnelly: It's, you know, 100 to 105, I think that's right.
[00:15:20] Gerard Donnelly: I've just got to check.
[00:15:22] Gerard Donnelly: Yep.
[00:15:22] Gerard Donnelly: And then the off is 90 to 92, but it's not off, it's just slowing down.
[00:15:30] Gerard Donnelly: Okay, and it's now just 20 minutes, so it's two by 1.30, four by, four by, four by, okay?
[00:15:37] Gerard Donnelly: So it's a straight 20-minute block, okay?
[00:15:40] Gerard Donnelly: It should be, anyway, starting at 24, ending at 44.
[00:15:46] Gerard Donnelly: Great.
[00:15:46] Gerard Donnelly: That's 20 minutes.
[00:15:49] Gerard Donnelly: And with the race, do your normal warm-up if you can, if possible, if you're allowed to swim.
[00:15:56] Gerard Donnelly: Do swim?
[00:15:57] Gerard Donnelly: I don't know how to pick it up.
[00:15:59] Gerard Donnelly: It's pretty, pretty.
[00:16:00] Abby Jorgensen: It's like chill, I think, but they're going off in time, so I don't know.
[00:16:05] Abby Jorgensen: Great.
[00:16:05] Gerard Donnelly: Well, maybe just get there early and go for a little run if you can.
[00:16:10] Gerard Donnelly: Or do a...
[00:16:15] Gerard Donnelly: Is there a there?
[00:16:18] Abby Jorgensen: Yeah, because that's what we'll use, a treadmill.
[00:16:21] Abby Jorgensen: Yes, of course.
[00:16:22] Gerard Donnelly: So jump on the treadmill and just do a warm-up.
[00:16:25] Gerard Donnelly: And if you get a chance, jump in the water.
[00:16:27] Gerard Donnelly: But if you don't, don't worry about it.
[00:16:28] Gerard Donnelly: And then, yeah, obviously go through the race, just have some fun on that.
[00:16:33] Gerard Donnelly: Yeah, I'd say it's seven miles and then two miles.
[00:16:36] Abby Jorgensen: right, But it's fine.
[00:16:39] Abby Jorgensen: That's better.
[00:16:40] Gerard Donnelly: That's a bit further.
[00:16:42] Abby Jorgensen: Yeah, I mean, it's just going to be on a spin bike, so it won't be power or anything.
[00:16:46] Abby Jorgensen: We'll just use my heart rate, I guess.
[00:16:50] Abby Jorgensen: Yeah, and, you know, feel.
[00:16:54] Gerard Donnelly: Yeah, it's just a charity fun thing, so.
[00:16:58] Abby Jorgensen: And, look, I'd like you to go for
[00:17:00] Gerard Donnelly: A little bit of a run after if you could.
[00:17:02] Gerard Donnelly: Yeah, be able to.
[00:17:04] Gerard Donnelly: And break that up, you know, break it up into an easy, easy start for 10, 15 minutes and then just gradually increase the speed and maybe, you know, just do something solid and then just finish off with a cool down.
[00:17:21] Gerard Donnelly: So just want to get you to run a bit, that's all.
[00:17:25] Gerard Donnelly: And obviously we're running a bit further off the bike on Saturday.
[00:17:30] Gerard Donnelly: So I'm happy for you to run a little bit further if you wanted to, if you felt okay.
[00:17:34] Gerard Donnelly: But it depends on how you felt after that modified bike session.
[00:17:37] Gerard Donnelly: Okay.
[00:17:38] Gerard Donnelly: I mean, I'm fine.
[00:17:41] Gerard Donnelly: My legs are fine.
[00:17:43] Gerard Donnelly: 120.
[00:17:44] Gerard Donnelly: Yeah.
[00:17:45] Gerard Donnelly: And just increasing that.
[00:17:46] Gerard Donnelly: And we want to get that up to 130 by next week.
[00:17:49] Gerard Donnelly: Okay.
[00:17:51] Gerard Donnelly: And if we can, just keep increasing the speed on this one, not the duration.
[00:17:58] Gerard Donnelly: So I'm fine.
[00:17:59] Gerard Donnelly: So don't know.
[00:17:59] Gerard Donnelly: So I'm,
[00:18:00] Gerard Donnelly: This stays the same, but definitely we want to push this out to 50 to 60 minutes if we can, and then do the intervals on the treadmill.
[00:18:09] Gerard Donnelly: Unless you can, I'd rather you're outside, but.
[00:18:12] Gerard Donnelly: Yeah, we'll see.
[00:18:13] Gerard Donnelly: Who knows?
[00:18:13] Abby Jorgensen: mean, it's next week it's cold too, but then the week after, who knows?
[00:18:17] Abby Jorgensen: Yeah.
[00:18:18] Gerard Donnelly: So you just decide.
[00:18:19] Gerard Donnelly: The idea is that number one is to get outside.
[00:18:21] Gerard Donnelly: And if it's impossible, then we just go indoors.
[00:18:26] Gerard Donnelly: Yeah.
[00:18:28] Gerard Donnelly: Okay.
[00:18:30] Gerard Donnelly: Let's get into it.
[00:18:31] Gerard Donnelly: Any other questions on yourself?
[00:18:33] Gerard Donnelly: Yeah.
[00:18:33] Gerard Donnelly: No, that's pretty much it.
[00:18:36] Abby Jorgensen: So Coco started the camp?
[00:18:39] Gerard Donnelly: Yeah.
[00:18:39] Abby Jorgensen: She, I guess, well, today, yesterday was the first day, I think.
[00:18:45] Abby Jorgensen: Yeah.
[00:18:47] Abby Jorgensen: From there, try to think.
[00:18:51] Abby Jorgensen: Yesterday was just kind of like she felt it out a little bit.
[00:18:54] Abby Jorgensen: Today, she said that, yeah, they had the bike.
[00:18:57] Abby Jorgensen: Like, she feels like the bike is just too easy, but.
[00:19:00] Abby Jorgensen: But like she was struggling mentally because it's she doesn't have the structure that we give her.
[00:19:05] Abby Jorgensen: So it's frustrating for her.
[00:19:08] Abby Jorgensen: But I told her I'm like, it's two weeks.
[00:19:09] Abby Jorgensen: Like we'll work together, but we can't you can't develop so much fatigue that, you know, she's struggling with that a little bit.
[00:19:18] Abby Jorgensen: But I'm like, it's day one, two.
[00:19:20] Abby Jorgensen: So just give it some time.
[00:19:23] Abby Jorgensen: Yeah.
[00:19:24] Gerard Donnelly: And look, if that's what they did, they did some run technique and they rode.
[00:19:28] Gerard Donnelly: It doesn't matter how slow, you're still riding for three hours.
[00:19:31] Gerard Donnelly: And they ran off the bike and then she went swimming.
[00:19:35] Gerard Donnelly: That's a freaking big day, Abby.
[00:19:37] Gerard Donnelly: That's what I told her.
[00:19:37] Abby Jorgensen: I told her we'd watch the, told her to keep an eye on the TSS and compare it to the, her hard weeks a few weeks ago.
[00:19:49] Gerard Donnelly: So, yeah.
[00:19:50] Gerard Donnelly: You know, that's great.
[00:19:52] Gerard Donnelly: You've got what you wanted to do.
[00:19:53] Gerard Donnelly: But if, God, my screen's starting to turn off.
[00:19:58] Gerard Donnelly: Um.
[00:20:01] Gerard Donnelly: But, you know, we just got to be super careful early.
[00:20:04] Gerard Donnelly: How long does the camp go for?
[00:20:06] Gerard Donnelly: Just two weeks, so.
[00:20:08] Abby Jorgensen: Yeah.
[00:20:09] Abby Jorgensen: So it's like a race.
[00:20:11] Gerard Donnelly: Let's just not go in too hard, you know.
[00:20:15] Gerard Donnelly: We'd rather tell her we can add stuff if you feel like, you know, you're coping.
[00:20:20] Abby Jorgensen: I told her just message me daily and then we'll go from there.
[00:20:25] Abby Jorgensen: But I was like, too, like in Ironman prep, I'm like, it's not like, it's a little different than 70.3.
[00:20:30] Abby Jorgensen: We don't need like two to three, like high intensity days, which she doesn't understand.
[00:20:36] Abby Jorgensen: She feels like she's going to go behind, get behind or something.
[00:20:39] Abby Jorgensen: I told her.
[00:20:40] Abby Jorgensen: If you need me to talk to her, just yell out.
[00:20:43] Gerard Donnelly: Okay.
[00:20:43] Gerard Donnelly: Yeah.
[00:20:44] Gerard Donnelly: We had a good talk today.
[00:20:45] Abby Jorgensen: So hopefully I settled her.
[00:20:46] Gerard Donnelly: I think she's just more anxious than anything.
[00:20:50] Abby Jorgensen: That's the type of person she is.
[00:20:52] Gerard Donnelly: And keep saying, Gerard and I, you know, we only give all of our elite Ironman people who, you know, on the.
[00:21:00] Gerard Donnelly: Podium, they have one hard session on the bike and more sub-threshold on the Tuesday or zone two.
[00:21:07] Gerard Donnelly: Yeah, I told her that today too.
[00:21:08] Abby Jorgensen: I was like, when I did my Ironman, I had one hard day and then the rest were longer.
[00:21:15] Abby Jorgensen: And she knows I coach you, doesn't she?
[00:21:17] Gerard Donnelly: Yep.
[00:21:18] Gerard Donnelly: Yep.
[00:21:19] Gerard Donnelly: And you should say, this is what Gerard gave me and this is what he's discussed with me.
[00:21:24] Gerard Donnelly: For you, for you, Coco.
[00:21:28] Gerard Donnelly: All good?
[00:21:29] Abby Jorgensen: Well, yeah, other than that, yeah, I told her just keep her runs nice and easy.
[00:21:35] Gerard Donnelly: Yeah.
[00:21:36] Gerard Donnelly: But I told her, yeah.
[00:21:38] Gerard Donnelly: Otherwise, I think she's good.
[00:21:41] Abby Jorgensen: We'll just have to, I'll just have to keep my line of communication open.
[00:21:47] Gerard Donnelly: Yep.
[00:21:48] Abby Jorgensen: Okay.
[00:21:49] Abby Jorgensen: Dougie?
[00:21:51] Abby Jorgensen: I had, I gave, he had a talk with him yesterday, so he gave me all his goals for this upcoming year.
[00:21:58] Abby Jorgensen: Um, Um.
[00:21:59] Abby Jorgensen: Good.
[00:21:59] Abby Jorgensen: Um...
[00:21:59] Abby Jorgensen: Okay.
[00:22:01] Abby Jorgensen: So he has quite a bit on there.
[00:22:03] Abby Jorgensen: So once he gets through this week, he says, need a test.
[00:22:07] Abby Jorgensen: And I was like, yes, yes, you do.
[00:22:08] Abby Jorgensen: So he's aware of all that.
[00:22:10] Gerard Donnelly: So yeah.
[00:22:12] Abby Jorgensen: So we have some goals for him, at least.
[00:22:16] Abby Jorgensen: yeah.
[00:22:18] Gerard Donnelly: And the days off here, Abby, because you can't train.
[00:22:21] Gerard Donnelly: Yeah.
[00:22:21] Abby Jorgensen: No, I just, I was just like a rough draft.
[00:22:25] Abby Jorgensen: So that's the following week.
[00:22:27] Gerard Donnelly: So this is this week.
[00:22:28] Abby Jorgensen: I was trying to figure out how, because I didn't know what day he can get to the pools, the pool this time of year.
[00:22:36] Abby Jorgensen: So I was just rough drafting it for him.
[00:22:40] Abby Jorgensen: Yep.
[00:22:40] Abby Jorgensen: Yep.
[00:22:41] Gerard Donnelly: And obviously we would try to do a long ride because he's got the indoor facility, hasn't he?
[00:22:47] Abby Jorgensen: Yeah, he has that kicker bike or whatever.
[00:22:50] Abby Jorgensen: Oh yeah.
[00:22:51] Gerard Donnelly: So maybe a long ride on there and a swim there.
[00:22:54] Gerard Donnelly: And if he can't swim there, then give him another run.
[00:23:00] Gerard Donnelly: Okay.
[00:23:00] Abby Jorgensen: Yeah.
[00:23:01] Abby Jorgensen: I asked him when he can get to the pool or like, I don't know, probably, probably not test the swim if he hasn't swam for a while, but maybe just.
[00:23:11] Abby Jorgensen: No, don't worry.
[00:23:13] Gerard Donnelly: No test.
[00:23:16] Gerard Donnelly: Can he do a park run?
[00:23:19] Abby Jorgensen: I mean, I can ask him what is on, what they have around there next week.
[00:23:25] Gerard Donnelly: He's in the UK, isn't he?
[00:23:26] Gerard Donnelly: Yeah.
[00:23:28] Abby Jorgensen: I think around London somewhere.
[00:23:30] Gerard Donnelly: Yeah.
[00:23:31] Gerard Donnelly: Really, if the weather's great, and I don't mean summer great, I mean, able to not run on ice or snow, then we want them out in a park run.
[00:23:42] Gerard Donnelly: We don't want them indoor on the treadmill.
[00:23:43] Gerard Donnelly: But if they can only do the treadmill, that's absolutely fine.
[00:23:46] Gerard Donnelly: Yeah.
[00:23:49] Gerard Donnelly: But we don't want him injured.
[00:23:50] Gerard Donnelly: But he's been doing running for the high rocks, so he should be fine.
[00:23:53] Gerard Donnelly: Yeah.
[00:23:54] Gerard Donnelly: He sent me some of his sessions.
[00:23:56] Abby Jorgensen: So, yeah.
[00:23:56] Abby Jorgensen: All All right.
[00:23:59] Abby Jorgensen: You're right with him.
[00:23:59] Gerard Donnelly: Any
[00:24:00] Gerard Donnelly: Any questions?
[00:24:00] Abby Jorgensen: No, I just want to get him back to a normal schedule.
[00:24:05] Abby Jorgensen: Otherwise, it makes it frustrating.
[00:24:09] Abby Jorgensen: Andrew got a run?
[00:24:11] Gerard Donnelly: Yep.
[00:24:11] Gerard Donnelly: He had a good run yesterday.
[00:24:14] Abby Jorgensen: Talked to him yesterday.
[00:24:16] Gerard Donnelly: Good stuff.
[00:24:17] Gerard Donnelly: That's a good one.
[00:24:19] Abby Jorgensen: Oh, yeah.
[00:24:20] Abby Jorgensen: I was going to ask you.
[00:24:22] Abby Jorgensen: So Andrew is going to do Michigan 70.3 in September, and that's one that I had thought about.
[00:24:30] Abby Jorgensen: Yes.
[00:24:31] Abby Jorgensen: So I think I want to do, instead of doing Omaha in June, because I don't have anybody to go with me because everybody's busy.
[00:24:38] Gerard Donnelly: Yep.
[00:24:40] Abby Jorgensen: Doing Michigan in September instead.
[00:24:44] Abby Jorgensen: Yep.
[00:24:45] Gerard Donnelly: Would that be here with anything?
[00:24:47] Gerard Donnelly: I just need to know where the running events are.
[00:24:52] Gerard Donnelly: That's all.
[00:24:53] Abby Jorgensen: The running events should be in there.
[00:24:58] Gerard Donnelly: In terms of Michigan.
[00:25:00] Gerard Donnelly: Yeah, give that one.
[00:25:03] Abby Jorgensen: April.
[00:25:05] Abby Jorgensen: I put in that June one, but I don't think I want to do that one.
[00:25:09] Abby Jorgensen: I'd rather go see Michigan.
[00:25:11] Abby Jorgensen: Michigan seems like a cool.
[00:25:13] Abby Jorgensen: That's my cruise.
[00:25:15] Abby Jorgensen: Yes.
[00:25:19] Abby Jorgensen: What date is Michigan?
[00:25:22] Abby Jorgensen: It'd be September 13th, I believe.
[00:25:26] Abby Jorgensen: Okay.
[00:25:26] Abby Jorgensen: Yeah.
[00:25:27] Abby Jorgensen: Is that enough time to get ready for then?
[00:25:31] Abby Jorgensen: I'm just going to put it in so I can.
[00:25:32] Gerard Donnelly: Yeah.
[00:25:36] Gerard Donnelly: I don't know if I've spelled that right, but.
[00:25:41] Abby Jorgensen: Yeah, you got it right.
[00:25:45] Gerard Donnelly: So week 33 and then week 38, five weeks.
[00:25:50] Gerard Donnelly: Yeah.
[00:25:51] Gerard Donnelly: Yeah, that's great.
[00:25:53] Gerard Donnelly: No one thinks the 70.3 wouldn't take me out of training too much.
[00:25:57] Gerard Donnelly: Well, you've got to.
[00:26:00] Gerard Donnelly: So what would I say?
[00:26:01] Gerard Donnelly: What would you say to your athlete?
[00:26:03] Gerard Donnelly: I mean, you need the weak recovery.
[00:26:06] Gerard Donnelly: If your athlete said, is it going to, training for the marathon, going to interfere with my 70.3, what would be the answer you would give them?
[00:26:14] Gerard Donnelly: No.
[00:26:16] Abby Jorgensen: I mean, we're just going to add in probably another bike.
[00:26:20] Abby Jorgensen: And other than that, nothing really changes.
[00:26:25] Gerard Donnelly: Yeah, but you also ask them the question, what's more important?
[00:26:29] Gerard Donnelly: Tell me what your priority is.
[00:26:30] Gerard Donnelly: Let me be clear.
[00:26:33] Abby Jorgensen: So my question.
[00:26:34] Abby Jorgensen: Marathon, yeah.
[00:26:36] Abby Jorgensen: And they may say, oh, no, I want to do well in both.
[00:26:39] Gerard Donnelly: Or I want to actually just do 70.3 as my A-race and I want to run the marathon just because there's three answers there, isn't there?
[00:26:47] Gerard Donnelly: Yeah.
[00:26:48] Gerard Donnelly: So you've given me one of those answers, which is brilliant.
[00:26:50] Gerard Donnelly: So you're telling me the marathon's your priority.
[00:26:53] Gerard Donnelly: And I'm telling you this as you thinking about your athlete.
[00:26:58] Gerard Donnelly: So you.
[00:27:00] Gerard Donnelly: You would say then, okay, you've told me that marathon's your goal.
[00:27:04] Gerard Donnelly: We've kept your swimming and riding going, but we would probably not be able to add much more swimming, but we would have to add another ride to the program because we still want the marathon.
[00:27:18] Gerard Donnelly: And if we added another swim, it's taking away from your marathon.
[00:27:23] Gerard Donnelly: All right, so, you know, you probably have to accept that you're not going to be as good in this 70.3 as you've been in others because we're restricting the swim and, you know, there'll be a time where in this period, January through now, we're still not going to add another bike.
[00:27:42] Gerard Donnelly: We're going to keep your running program going.
[00:27:45] Gerard Donnelly: So you've got to make that clear to the athlete and then are you okay with that?
[00:27:52] Gerard Donnelly: So you've got to say, oh, no, and say, well, okay, let's discuss it again, you know?
[00:27:57] Gerard Donnelly: Yeah.
[00:27:57] Gerard Donnelly: Um.
[00:28:00] Gerard Donnelly: So when they say, I want to do well in both, well, you won't do as well in both if you've got two goals that are six weeks apart.
[00:28:10] Gerard Donnelly: So the marathon will be compromised and so will your 70.3.
[00:28:14] Gerard Donnelly: But if you selected one or the other, you would have a little bit less of a result in the 70.3 and the best outcome for the marathon.
[00:28:24] Gerard Donnelly: Okay.
[00:28:25] Abby Jorgensen: Yeah, I make sense.
[00:28:27] Gerard Donnelly: So good question.
[00:28:39] Gerard Donnelly: Andrew, so Andrew, you happy with him as usual?
[00:28:42] Gerard Donnelly: Yeah, he's good.
[00:28:44] Abby Jorgensen: just, I, that triggered a, that my question I wanted to ask is he, he said we'd get a, like an Airbnb and all that stuff easier for us.
[00:28:54] Abby Jorgensen: You go together.
[00:28:55] Gerard Donnelly: Somebody that.
[00:28:56] Gerard Donnelly: You go with Andrew?
[00:28:58] Gerard Donnelly: Yeah.
[00:28:58] Gerard Donnelly: Absolutely Yeah.
[00:28:59] Gerard Donnelly: Absolutely brilliant.
[00:29:00] Gerard Donnelly: Thank Abby.
[00:29:00] Gerard Donnelly: That's great.
[00:29:01] Gerard Donnelly: Fantastic.
[00:29:02] Gerard Donnelly: Okay.
[00:29:03] Gerard Donnelly: Well, we'll talk about that with you later, but...
[00:29:07] Gerard Donnelly: Yeah.
[00:29:09] Gerard Donnelly: Okay.
[00:29:10] Gerard Donnelly: James has just texted me.
[00:29:17] Gerard Donnelly: We'll look at getting all the equipment tomorrow.
[00:29:21] Gerard Donnelly: What's a solicitor for you guys?
[00:29:24] Abby Jorgensen: What does that entail?
[00:29:26] Gerard Donnelly: Lloyd.
[00:29:27] Gerard Donnelly: Oh, okay.
[00:29:28] Gerard Donnelly: Yeah.
[00:29:29] Abby Jorgensen: A solicitor here would be somebody who just, like, cold calls people and tries to sell random .
[00:29:38] Abby Jorgensen: So that's why I was like a solicitor.
[00:29:40] Abby Jorgensen: I was like, oh, okay.
[00:29:41] Abby Jorgensen: He's a lawyer.
[00:29:43] Gerard Donnelly: Okay.
[00:29:44] Gerard Donnelly: And lawyers can take many levels.
[00:29:47] Gerard Donnelly: could be in court.
[00:29:48] Gerard Donnelly: They could just be in admin.
[00:29:50] Gerard Donnelly: They could be...
[00:29:51] Gerard Donnelly: I didn't really dig in.
[00:29:56] Gerard Donnelly: Okay.
[00:29:57] Gerard Donnelly: So you're right with Andrew?
[00:29:58] Gerard Donnelly: Yep.
[00:29:59] Gerard Donnelly: Yep.
[00:29:59] Gerard Donnelly: Yep.
[00:29:59] Gerard Donnelly: Yep.
[00:30:00] Gerard Donnelly: He just travels next week, but I got it all figured out.
[00:30:04] Gerard Donnelly: Sin, how are we going?
[00:30:07] Gerard Donnelly: No, he's good too.
[00:30:09] Abby Jorgensen: Back on track.
[00:30:10] Abby Jorgensen: So he'd be going into week three, week two.
[00:30:15] Gerard Donnelly: Yep.
[00:30:17] Abby Jorgensen: Yep, great.
[00:30:18] Gerard Donnelly: He seems like he's hitting the targets.
[00:30:20] Gerard Donnelly: That's good 48K running.
[00:30:22] Gerard Donnelly: That's great.
[00:30:23] Gerard Donnelly: Yeah, his running is good.
[00:30:25] Abby Jorgensen: 200K, that's fantastic.
[00:30:27] Gerard Donnelly: Hold on.
[00:30:28] Gerard Donnelly: He coped with Alcduez, did he?
[00:30:30] Gerard Donnelly: Yeah, he said it was fun because it gave him something to.
[00:30:32] Gerard Donnelly: Yeah.
[00:30:33] Gerard Donnelly: You could start doing this, Abby, if you want, with some of your athletes.
[00:30:38] Gerard Donnelly: I should find if there's one on TrainingPeaks virtual.
[00:30:42] Abby Jorgensen: Yeah, there have to be.
[00:30:44] Abby Jorgensen: Because that's what I use now too, so.
[00:30:47] Gerard Donnelly: Yep.
[00:30:48] Gerard Donnelly: So this is the start of the climb here.
[00:30:51] Gerard Donnelly: So this bit here, Abby, is the start of the climb.
[00:30:54] Gerard Donnelly: Oh, okay.
[00:30:55] Gerard Donnelly: Oh, yeah, I guess you can see it go back and forth.
[00:30:58] Gerard Donnelly: Yeah, so just...
[00:30:59] Gerard Donnelly: You...
[00:30:59] Gerard Donnelly: I'll just...
[00:31:00] Gerard Donnelly: This is the real afterwards, and it goes to there.
[00:31:04] Gerard Donnelly: so anybody, so the good guys can do, our really good guys can do it in 48, 50, 52 minutes.
[00:31:12] Gerard Donnelly: And so given your perspective, the really, the novice riders are a 110 to 120.
[00:31:20] Gerard Donnelly: So, you know, we're not asking him to ride hard.
[00:31:23] Gerard Donnelly: He's riding an 80% there.
[00:31:24] Gerard Donnelly: So if that's right, you know.
[00:31:29] Gerard Donnelly: And, you know, he's doing well there.
[00:31:30] Gerard Donnelly: That's good.
[00:31:33] Gerard Donnelly: That's a good session.
[00:31:38] Gerard Donnelly: But you're confident with him?
[00:31:40] Gerard Donnelly: Yeah.
[00:31:41] Gerard Donnelly: Yep.
[00:31:43] Gerard Donnelly: Good.
[00:31:43] Gerard Donnelly: Chris did the half marathon.
[00:31:45] Gerard Donnelly: Yeah, he did amazing.
[00:31:47] Abby Jorgensen: It's a PR forum.
[00:31:52] Gerard Donnelly: Yeah, he executed it perfectly.
[00:31:54] Abby Jorgensen: He, like, texted me so happy.
[00:31:55] Abby Jorgensen: And then he called me today.
[00:31:57] Abby Jorgensen: We had a chat, but.
[00:31:59] Abby Jorgensen: Yeah.
[00:32:00] Abby Jorgensen: He said it was a lot hillier than it looks on like Strava and everything, but he managed it really well.
[00:32:07] Gerard Donnelly: Jeez, 200 metres of elevation, that's a lot.
[00:32:10] Gerard Donnelly: Yeah.
[00:32:13] Gerard Donnelly: That's the minimum we would give for a long run, 200 metres.
[00:32:20] Gerard Donnelly: That's silly.
[00:32:22] Abby Jorgensen: I mean, it looks silly, but sometimes you just never know.
[00:32:28] Gerard Donnelly: PRs and everything.
[00:32:30] Gerard Donnelly: 10 mile, half marathon.
[00:32:31] Abby Jorgensen: He wasn't far off on his 10K and 5K either.
[00:32:38] Abby Jorgensen: He broke 50 minutes.
[00:32:40] Gerard Donnelly: Yeah.
[00:32:46] Gerard Donnelly: So 48, yeah, a minute 30.
[00:32:49] Gerard Donnelly: That's great.
[00:32:51] Gerard Donnelly: Really well done.
[00:32:53] Abby Jorgensen: Yeah, and he didn't know, like we had talked Saturday and he was like, I don't know, my group ride, my legs are a little heavy.
[00:32:58] Abby Jorgensen: And I was like, well, you have permission.
[00:32:59] Abby Jorgensen: Okay.
[00:33:00] Abby Jorgensen: like, I know you said you just want to do it for fun.
[00:33:03] Abby Jorgensen: So, like, if you need to abandon ship, like, just do what you need to do.
[00:33:09] Abby Jorgensen: And then he texted me Sunday and he's like, well, I just PR'd.
[00:33:17] Gerard Donnelly: That's brilliant.
[00:33:18] Gerard Donnelly: Well done.
[00:33:18] Gerard Donnelly: So, yeah.
[00:33:21] Gerard Donnelly: Good stuff.
[00:33:22] Gerard Donnelly: All right.
[00:33:24] Gerard Donnelly: What's his goals?
[00:33:25] Gerard Donnelly: I've forgotten.
[00:33:27] Gerard Donnelly: He has Oceanside in, like, nine weeks.
[00:33:31] Gerard Donnelly: Yeah.
[00:33:32] Gerard Donnelly: Okay.
[00:33:34] Gerard Donnelly: So you're happy that he's on track?
[00:33:36] Gerard Donnelly: Yeah.
[00:33:37] Gerard Donnelly: Yeah.
[00:33:37] Gerard Donnelly: He's fun to work with as well.
[00:33:39] Abby Jorgensen: Yeah.
[00:33:40] Gerard Donnelly: He's traveling.
[00:33:43] Gerard Donnelly: Friday, yeah.
[00:33:45] Gerard Donnelly: Yeah.
[00:33:45] Gerard Donnelly: Okay.
[00:33:46] Gerard Donnelly: Yeah.
[00:33:47] Gerard Donnelly: So is it nine weeks, is it Abby?
[00:33:49] Gerard Donnelly: What date is it?
[00:33:54] Gerard Donnelly: So March 28th.
[00:33:56] Gerard Donnelly: Okay.
[00:33:57] Gerard Donnelly: So you're going to start him with the race ready soon, yep.
[00:34:00] Gerard Donnelly: Yep.
[00:34:01] Abby Jorgensen: I told them we'll get through basically this next cycle or next block and then right after.
[00:34:09] Abby Jorgensen: Yep.
[00:34:10] Gerard Donnelly: Okay.
[00:34:12] Gerard Donnelly: And I told them.
[00:34:14] Gerard Donnelly: Has he done many?
[00:34:15] Gerard Donnelly: Has he done many Half-Heiners?
[00:34:18] Gerard Donnelly: What is it?
[00:34:18] Abby Jorgensen: I think he's done two.
[00:34:20] Abby Jorgensen: He's done a full and then, yeah, he's done a couple.
[00:34:25] Gerard Donnelly: Yep.
[00:34:26] Gerard Donnelly: Okay.
[00:34:27] Gerard Donnelly: Um, so this is week two.
[00:34:32] Gerard Donnelly: Can you give him a race ready session here, please?
[00:34:36] Gerard Donnelly: Yeah.
[00:34:37] Gerard Donnelly: Um, and then that's week three and then that's testing week.
[00:34:43] Gerard Donnelly: Can you give him a 60 minute here?
[00:34:47] Gerard Donnelly: Where does he live?
[00:34:48] Gerard Donnelly: California.
[00:34:50] Gerard Donnelly: Oh, great.
[00:34:51] Abby Jorgensen: Pasadena area.
[00:34:54] Abby Jorgensen: Okay.
[00:34:54] Gerard Donnelly: I'll just, I'll make a note for you.
[00:34:56] Gerard Donnelly: Okay.
[00:34:58] Gerard Donnelly: Yeah, I told him today on the phone.
[00:35:00] Abby Jorgensen: Because he does all those, he does bunch rides on Saturdays, and I was like, enjoy those for like one or two more, and then we're going to get into some race-ready stuff.
[00:35:12] Gerard Donnelly: And, you know, this is the, this is the, you know, do the 4x30.
[00:35:19] Gerard Donnelly: Yeah, one of those.
[00:35:21] Gerard Donnelly: This is telling the reason, you know, we just need to give you as many practice opportunities as possible.
[00:35:28] Gerard Donnelly: And, you know, we'll go back to the bunch rides.
[00:35:32] Gerard Donnelly: You know, you'll have, out of the year, you'll have plenty more bunch rides, but during this period, in order for you, you've engaged us to get the right outcome, you need to be on board with this for the next eight weeks.
[00:35:44] Gerard Donnelly: And we've got a race in Geelong the week before, and I've got most of the guys already doing race-ready.
[00:35:52] Gerard Donnelly: They started last week, so, and they're only a week apart, so, okay.
[00:35:58] Gerard Donnelly: Yep.
[00:35:59] Abby Jorgensen: Yeah, he's of.
[00:36:00] Abby Jorgensen: Full on board with whatever.
[00:36:02] Abby Jorgensen: I just wanted to give him a heads up so he could.
[00:36:05] Abby Jorgensen: I'm just hitting that so he can't say that.
[00:36:12] Gerard Donnelly: Kevin?
[00:36:13] Gerard Donnelly: Kevin Good.
[00:36:14] Abby Jorgensen: He tested FTP 11 watt or 9 watt, 10 watt increase, something like that.
[00:36:23] Abby Jorgensen: And then his swim was almost 25, 30 seconds faster.
[00:36:27] Abby Jorgensen: Oh, wow.
[00:36:28] Abby Jorgensen: I don't think it's in the spreadsheet yet, but I was given Marv.
[00:36:31] Abby Jorgensen: Didn't Marv say he was finishing everything?
[00:36:34] Gerard Donnelly: That should have been.
[00:36:36] Gerard Donnelly: Is the FTP in the spreadsheet?
[00:36:38] Gerard Donnelly: It wasn't like an hour before I talked to you.
[00:36:41] Gerard Donnelly: Yeah, no, he should have done that.
[00:36:44] Abby Jorgensen: Where's Marv located at?
[00:36:46] Gerard Donnelly: He's in Indonesia.
[00:36:49] Gerard Donnelly: So Bali.
[00:36:50] Abby Jorgensen: Yeah, he's not actually in Bali, but it's like me saying he's in America and you're saying he's in LA.
[00:36:57] Gerard Donnelly: Well, he's somewhere in America.
[00:37:02] Gerard Donnelly: I mean, America.
[00:37:05] Gerard Donnelly: We're a mess over here.
[00:37:07] Gerard Donnelly: Don't.
[00:37:08] Gerard Donnelly: Yeah.
[00:37:10] Abby Jorgensen: of the world.
[00:37:12] Abby Jorgensen: Yes.
[00:37:14] Gerard Donnelly: Uh, okay.
[00:37:14] Gerard Donnelly: So you're happy with Kevin?
[00:37:16] Gerard Donnelly: Um, testing well.
[00:37:18] Abby Jorgensen: He's testing well and, uh, he's supposed to meet with his physical therapist this week.
[00:37:23] Abby Jorgensen: I believe Wednesday, maybe Tuesday.
[00:37:25] Gerard Donnelly: Yeah.
[00:37:27] Abby Jorgensen: I mean, he does fine on the runs.
[00:37:30] Abby Jorgensen: There, but yeah, I'm just like, I don't feel like, or it can't really progress you until.
[00:37:36] Abby Jorgensen: Yeah.
[00:37:37] Gerard Donnelly: What's his race, Abby?
[00:37:39] Gerard Donnelly: July.
[00:37:43] Gerard Donnelly: Fine man.
[00:37:44] Gerard Donnelly: .
[00:37:45] Gerard Donnelly: Okay.
[00:37:48] Gerard Donnelly: That's a full line man.
[00:37:49] Gerard Donnelly: Yeah.
[00:37:50] Gerard Donnelly: Yes.
[00:37:51] Gerard Donnelly: Oh my God.
[00:37:53] Gerard Donnelly: Okay.
[00:37:54] Abby Jorgensen: I mean, his biking obviously is done a lot of biking.
[00:37:58] Abby Jorgensen: Yeah.
[00:38:00] Gerard Donnelly: Yep.
[00:38:01] Gerard Donnelly: He's going to get ready for a marathon.
[00:38:03] Gerard Donnelly: That's the thing.
[00:38:04] Gerard Donnelly: Yeah.
[00:38:05] Gerard Donnelly: Yep.
[00:38:06] Gerard Donnelly: Keep progressing his long ride if you can.
[00:38:09] Abby Jorgensen: Okay.
[00:38:10] Gerard Donnelly: Um, we, we want to be starting to do, uh, he's training indoor with.
[00:38:15] Gerard Donnelly: Yeah.
[00:38:15] Abby Jorgensen: He's in nor Norway or.
[00:38:19] Abby Jorgensen: Yeah.
[00:38:20] Gerard Donnelly: Okay.
[00:38:20] Gerard Donnelly: Yeah.
[00:38:21] Gerard Donnelly: It's cool.
[00:38:23] Gerard Donnelly: Yep.
[00:38:24] Gerard Donnelly: So, uh, is he on Zwift, Abby or any.
[00:38:29] Gerard Donnelly: He's on Zwift.
[00:38:30] Gerard Donnelly: Yep.
[00:38:31] Gerard Donnelly: So, you know, how we talked about the treadmill where you can, we can muck it.
[00:38:35] Gerard Donnelly: Well, how we've got the indoor stuff.
[00:38:38] Gerard Donnelly: You, can get him, you can get him to do his youth race and then do some of the training peak session and then maybe finish with elk du es or something like that.
[00:38:47] Gerard Donnelly: You know, he can really mix it up so that he's during the winter period, he's going to get three to four hours of riding.
[00:38:54] Gerard Donnelly: Um, so tell him we want to progress it and we want you to have a mixture.
[00:38:58] Gerard Donnelly: If you want to jump.
[00:39:00] Gerard Donnelly: You know, do a 40k, 50k endurance race or a 100k endurance race or a 140k endurance race.
[00:39:07] Gerard Donnelly: Great.
[00:39:07] Gerard Donnelly: Get in the race or event.
[00:39:11] Gerard Donnelly: But if you want to do a 60k race, then do some of the TrainingPeaks session we give you and then finish off with another race, 40k, 30k.
[00:39:19] Gerard Donnelly: Okay.
[00:39:20] Gerard Donnelly: Just make it sure that they're not sitting there on the trainer, bored out of their brains where there's no stimulus.
[00:39:30] Gerard Donnelly: Yeah.
[00:39:32] Abby Jorgensen: I feel that.
[00:39:34] Gerard Donnelly: Yes.
[00:39:36] Gerard Donnelly: Yeah.
[00:39:36] Gerard Donnelly: So try to, yeah, try to explain to him that we're, you know, we, this TrainingPeaks session is perfect, Abby, but, but it's still only two hours 50, you know.
[00:39:51] Gerard Donnelly: Um, and, you know, we want to, we want to push you into three to three and a half to four hours as we progress.
[00:39:58] Gerard Donnelly: Did I say it was 23 weeks ago?
[00:40:00] Gerard Donnelly: Is that what I thought?
[00:40:00] Gerard Donnelly: I think I saw.
[00:40:02] Gerard Donnelly: Yeah.
[00:40:03] Abby Jorgensen: Yeah.
[00:40:04] Gerard Donnelly: So we're not panicking, but just want to keep pushing it each week, the endurance, so that when we get to the end of the next four or five weeks, he's been able to cope with three and a half to four hours on the indoor trainer.
[00:40:17] Abby Jorgensen: Yeah.
[00:40:18] Abby Jorgensen: All right?
[00:40:19] Abby Jorgensen: Yep.
[00:40:21] Gerard Donnelly: It's really good to plant the seed now of why we're doing things, because, you know, the race will be here before you know it, and we've got to progress, progress, progress all the time.
[00:40:33] Gerard Donnelly: And that's not every single week.
[00:40:35] Gerard Donnelly: Obviously, during the recovery weeks, you know, you drop that back and let him recover.
[00:40:40] Gerard Donnelly: Anything else on Kevin?
[00:40:42] Gerard Donnelly: Nope.
[00:40:43] Abby Jorgensen: Other than I just hope he can run here soon, or at least more than what is.
[00:40:49] Gerard Donnelly: I think he can run too, so.
[00:40:51] Gerard Donnelly: Yeah.
[00:40:53] Gerard Donnelly: Okay.
[00:40:54] Gerard Donnelly: Richard?
[00:40:56] Abby Jorgensen: Richard's, yeah, he's doing well as well.
[00:41:00] Abby Jorgensen: He complained a little bit about some tight calves, so I pulled back, so I kept his volume the same this week and just kind of see how it goes.
[00:41:10] Abby Jorgensen: But otherwise, he said he's been feeling the best he's felt in a while.
[00:41:15] Gerard Donnelly: Fantastic.
[00:41:17] Gerard Donnelly: And look, same principle, if you feel that they're not coping with any changes in intensity in the running, explain to them.
[00:41:25] Gerard Donnelly: If you're starting to get tightness in your calves, we've got example after example of athletes who just ride hard and just run steady, just run, you know, run.
[00:41:35] Gerard Donnelly: Not easy, but just getting the volume in from just aerobic running.
[00:41:41] Gerard Donnelly: So if we have to, Richard, we'll do that so that you keep your running volume.
[00:41:45] Gerard Donnelly: We need to push it, you know, each week into the 30 to 40 Ks or, you know, 20 miles, 25 miles.
[00:41:52] Gerard Donnelly: So, yeah, what's his race?
[00:41:57] Gerard Donnelly: He has...
[00:42:00] Abby Jorgensen: Like a sprint and some Olympic distance on the calendar.
[00:42:05] Abby Jorgensen: Okay.
[00:42:11] Gerard Donnelly: Yep, he looks like he's going well.
[00:42:13] Gerard Donnelly: That's great.
[00:42:16] Gerard Donnelly: All right.
[00:42:19] Gerard Donnelly: Michaela?
[00:42:22] Abby Jorgensen: She's doing well.
[00:42:25] Abby Jorgensen: Well, I think by the end of the week, she was finally, finally put everything together for that Saturday ride.
[00:42:32] Abby Jorgensen: She was struck.
[00:42:33] Abby Jorgensen: It's really hilly, whatever that race is there.
[00:42:38] Abby Jorgensen: So she was struggling with learning how to like ship with her TT bike.
[00:42:45] Abby Jorgensen: But her race ready ride was, I was happy with it after the beginning of the week.
[00:42:54] Gerard Donnelly: Well, that was good.
[00:42:57] Gerard Donnelly: Jeez, that's good.
[00:42:58] Gerard Donnelly: Yeah.
[00:42:59] Gerard Donnelly: Yeah.
[00:42:59] Gerard Donnelly: Because the...
[00:43:00] Gerard Donnelly: Put up the elevation.
[00:43:05] Gerard Donnelly: Yeah.
[00:43:06] Gerard Donnelly: Yeah, so.
[00:43:13] Gerard Donnelly: Hey, Lani.
[00:43:15] Gerard Donnelly: I'm just in the middle of a call.
[00:43:16] Gerard Donnelly: Is that okay?
[00:43:18] Gerard Donnelly: Okay.
[00:43:24] Gerard Donnelly: That's good.
[00:43:25] Gerard Donnelly: 280 meters.
[00:43:26] Gerard Donnelly: There's actually not that much elevation.
[00:43:28] Gerard Donnelly: Oh, really?
[00:43:28] Gerard Donnelly: I mean, it seemed.
[00:43:30] Abby Jorgensen: Yeah.
[00:43:30] Abby Jorgensen: Well, said the whole course.
[00:43:32] Abby Jorgensen: Like, she rode it once.
[00:43:34] Abby Jorgensen: Yeah.
[00:43:34] Gerard Donnelly: It's rolling.
[00:43:35] Gerard Donnelly: Definitely rolling heels.
[00:43:37] Abby Jorgensen: She just used to sew flat where she lives up in wherever that it was a struggle for beginning of the week.
[00:43:45] Abby Jorgensen: Yeah.
[00:43:45] Abby Jorgensen: Yeah, that's fine.
[00:43:46] Abby Jorgensen: She's starting to feel more comfortable on the bike or on the TT bike, at least.
[00:43:50] Gerard Donnelly: Yeah, it's good.
[00:43:51] Gerard Donnelly: So.
[00:43:52] Abby Jorgensen: And her running's coming along.
[00:43:53] Abby Jorgensen: She saw a doctor today, and the doctor just tells her what everybody else does.
[00:43:59] Abby Jorgensen: And she's
[00:44:00] Abby Jorgensen: just needs more strength.
[00:44:03] Gerard Donnelly: So she's got challenge in four weeks.
[00:44:07] Gerard Donnelly: Yeah.
[00:44:08] Abby Jorgensen: Yeah, good.
[00:44:17] Gerard Donnelly: Is she coping with, is she training indoor or outdoor?
[00:44:20] Gerard Donnelly: Indoor today with that one.
[00:44:24] Abby Jorgensen: She got back home.
[00:44:26] Abby Jorgensen: Yeah, she's making that.
[00:44:28] Gerard Donnelly: Yeah.
[00:44:31] Gerard Donnelly: Okay, very good.
[00:44:33] Gerard Donnelly: Anything else on here?
[00:44:35] Gerard Donnelly: No.
[00:44:37] Gerard Donnelly: Blair?
[00:44:39] Abby Jorgensen: Blair's back on the, back on the train.
[00:44:44] Abby Jorgensen: Yeah, just eased into it.
[00:44:46] Abby Jorgensen: You missed Monday because it's travel and, but yeah, back into it.
[00:44:52] Abby Jorgensen: We'll test them this week and get some numbers and get back to it.
[00:44:56] Gerard Donnelly: Okay.
[00:44:57] Gerard Donnelly: Pemberton?
[00:44:58] Gerard Donnelly: I'm what?
[00:44:58] Gerard Donnelly: I'm to I not that's
[00:45:00] Gerard Donnelly: If I'm going to each athlete, I'll be yelling out if I'm going too quick.
[00:45:04] Gerard Donnelly: Yeah, you're fine.
[00:45:04] Abby Jorgensen: Most of them this week has been pretty quiet with most everybody.
[00:45:09] Gerard Donnelly: Yeah, second week.
[00:45:11] Gerard Donnelly: Yeah, she did pretty good.
[00:45:13] Abby Jorgensen: She was traveling and still hit everything.
[00:45:16] Abby Jorgensen: Yeah.
[00:45:19] Gerard Donnelly: That was a lovely message she sent.
[00:45:22] Abby Jorgensen: Yeah.
[00:45:23] Abby Jorgensen: Yeah, she she's doing good.
[00:45:25] Abby Jorgensen: You thought we thought we'd have a challenge with her, but she really hasn't been.
[00:45:28] Abby Jorgensen: No, I got that wrong.
[00:45:31] Gerard Donnelly: Yeah, absolutely.
[00:45:33] Gerard Donnelly: Well done.
[00:45:34] Gerard Donnelly: Yeah.
[00:45:34] Gerard Donnelly: Glenn?
[00:45:37] Abby Jorgensen: Glenn, he's I mean, he's doing good.
[00:45:40] Abby Jorgensen: I think he missed the swim today, but he told me to move it.
[00:45:45] Abby Jorgensen: But.
[00:45:48] Gerard Donnelly: Sprint.
[00:45:50] Gerard Donnelly: Yeah, and then nothing really on the calendar yet.
[00:45:52] Abby Jorgensen: I mean, he wants to do a 70.3, but his work right now is a little crazy.
[00:45:59] Abby Jorgensen: There's a.
[00:46:00] Gerard Donnelly: There's a 70.3 in May in Busselton, Busso, in West Australia, which is only a three-hour flight from Bali.
[00:46:13] Gerard Donnelly: So tell him about that one.
[00:46:15] Gerard Donnelly: It's called, I think it's the Busso 100.
[00:46:19] Gerard Donnelly: Oh, okay.
[00:46:20] Abby Jorgensen: So it's not an Ironman event?
[00:46:21] Abby Jorgensen: It's just a?
[00:46:22] Abby Jorgensen: No.
[00:46:23] Gerard Donnelly: Just another?
[00:46:24] Gerard Donnelly: Okay.
[00:46:24] Gerard Donnelly: It's the closest one to him.
[00:46:29] Gerard Donnelly: It's May the 2nd.
[00:46:31] Gerard Donnelly: It's called the Busselton Festival of Triathlon, Busso 100.
[00:46:36] Gerard Donnelly: So that's something you can think about.
[00:46:39] Gerard Donnelly: Okay.
[00:46:40] Gerard Donnelly: Yeah.
[00:46:41] Abby Jorgensen: He has some 5K this weekend.
[00:46:45] Abby Jorgensen: So he's going to jump into that.
[00:46:47] Abby Jorgensen: then after 5K, should I add a little bit more onto that run later?
[00:46:53] Abby Jorgensen: Yes.
[00:46:54] Abby Jorgensen: He's running at 4 a.m., so I was like, well, do the run, and then you can run later.
[00:46:59] Abby Jorgensen: into that.
[00:47:03] Gerard Donnelly: If he does the warm-up properly, you'll get 10 or 15 minutes of warm-up and then cool down.
[00:47:17] Gerard Donnelly: That should be enough, Abby.
[00:47:19] Gerard Donnelly: So I'm reluctant to give them a set pace sometimes because they come back at me saying, I could have run faster.
[00:47:28] Gerard Donnelly: Well, he thinks he can run faster than that, so I had to pull back on him.
[00:47:32] Gerard Donnelly: Yeah.
[00:47:34] Gerard Donnelly: Normally I grab the 10K session.
[00:47:37] Gerard Donnelly: It's got the warm-up in it.
[00:47:40] Gerard Donnelly: And then I just change it just to read 5K.
[00:47:48] Gerard Donnelly: 5K.
[00:47:50] Gerard Donnelly: 5K.
[00:47:51] Gerard Donnelly: It's not a park run.
[00:47:53] Gerard Donnelly: And then I'd get him to walk five minutes, change that.
[00:47:59] Gerard Donnelly: Walk five five minutes.
[00:48:00] Gerard Donnelly: And then easy 15 to 5 to 20 minute cool down and then change the distance of the run and then you've got a 5k session where he's got the warm up and then you're giving in this range 4 minute k pace to 4.28 and it's up to him.
[00:48:17] Abby Jorgensen: Okay.
[00:48:18] Gerard Donnelly: And that way you're not forcing him into, you want him to start slow, that's your advice.
[00:48:25] Gerard Donnelly: And this gives the onus on them rather than them just following a script.
[00:48:29] Gerard Donnelly: You know, the script is great.
[00:48:31] Gerard Donnelly: That's a perfect session if you feel that the person will follow it and that they've got enough intelligence to say this is too easy, I can go harder down the end of the session.
[00:48:42] Gerard Donnelly: But people, I've had them come back to me saying I could have gone harder at the end but you said I need to run here.
[00:48:48] Gerard Donnelly: I was going, no, that's not what I meant.
[00:48:50] Gerard Donnelly: You know, if you can run harder at the end, run harder.
[00:48:55] Gerard Donnelly: The idea is to set you up early so that you can run as hard as you like.
[00:48:59] Gerard Donnelly: This is just the guide.
[00:49:01] Gerard Donnelly: So I think sometimes that's a better session, Abby, than that one.
[00:49:04] Gerard Donnelly: Okay.
[00:49:06] Gerard Donnelly: We'll just hide that one anyway.
[00:49:10] Gerard Donnelly: Okay.
[00:49:11] Gerard Donnelly: Anything else on Gwaine?
[00:49:13] Abby Jorgensen: No, other than sometimes I have to  him down from what his expectations sometimes.
[00:49:19] Abby Jorgensen: He thinks he can run like a sub-20, 5K right now, and I'm like, hmm.
[00:49:23] Abby Jorgensen: Well, my answer to that is, great, show me, but you never, you know.
[00:49:30] Abby Jorgensen: I pulled out the blackmail and did some calculations.
[00:49:33] Abby Jorgensen: I'm like, technically, this is about where you will be.
[00:49:37] Abby Jorgensen: I'm not saying that you can't do it, but I'm just, you know, you want to get ahead of yourself.
[00:49:42] Abby Jorgensen: Has he run, what's the best 5K?
[00:49:44] Gerard Donnelly: So you know how you can go into dashboard and you can see his PB, 5K, you know, that's for a whole year.
[00:49:52] Gerard Donnelly: 4.11 is his PB.
[00:49:54] Gerard Donnelly: 4.12, he did that in 12K.
[00:49:57] Gerard Donnelly: That's not to say he can't.
[00:50:00] Gerard Donnelly: 411.
[00:50:01] Gerard Donnelly: That was off the bike, you know, so his form in a 12K run, that was his 10K.
[00:50:09] Gerard Donnelly: Did you do that?
[00:50:10] Gerard Donnelly: Did you do that, think?
[00:50:12] Gerard Donnelly: It must have been, was it a test?
[00:50:14] Abby Jorgensen: No, it was his 10K just two weeks ago, last week, two weeks ago.
[00:50:19] Gerard Donnelly: what did run?
[00:50:24] Gerard Donnelly: 43.
[00:50:25] Gerard Donnelly: So you plugged in McMillan 43, and what did that give him?
[00:50:27] Gerard Donnelly: 21, was it?
[00:50:28] Abby Jorgensen: Yeah, 21 or, yeah, right around there.
[00:50:32] Abby Jorgensen: So you did plug that in, yeah?
[00:50:34] Gerard Donnelly: Yep.
[00:50:35] Abby Jorgensen: Yep, okay.
[00:50:37] Abby Jorgensen: Yeah, it was, let's see here, I have it still pulled up, actually.
[00:50:42] Abby Jorgensen: Yeah, 2103 was his predicted.
[00:50:46] Gerard Donnelly: Yeah, but I would say he's running that second half at 2102 in that 10K.
[00:50:57] Gerard Donnelly: So you would say that he could run better than that.
[00:51:00] Gerard Donnelly: That fresh for 5K, wouldn't you?
[00:51:02] Gerard Donnelly: We think, yeah.
[00:51:03] Gerard Donnelly: Has McMillan got that right?
[00:51:05] Gerard Donnelly: That's what it says.
[00:51:07] Abby Jorgensen: It says 2103 current.
[00:51:15] Gerard Donnelly: Yep, that says.
[00:51:17] Gerard Donnelly: But that's the trouble with these predictors.
[00:51:20] Gerard Donnelly: He's actually run a 2102 in the second half of his 10K.
[00:51:25] Gerard Donnelly: So I would give him the benefit of the doubt, Abby.
[00:51:27] Gerard Donnelly: I'd say just start around at 4.12, 4.15 pace.
[00:51:33] Gerard Donnelly: Yeah, I think that's what I told him.
[00:51:34] Abby Jorgensen: And then I was like, if you can finish just up your 4.
[00:51:38] Abby Jorgensen: What, like 3.64?
[00:51:40] Abby Jorgensen: We didn't go for it.
[00:51:41] Gerard Donnelly: Let go for it.
[00:51:42] Gerard Donnelly: Yeah, just tell him.
[00:51:43] Gerard Donnelly: Show me that you can run close to 20 minutes.
[00:51:47] Gerard Donnelly: That's what I'll be saying.
[00:51:48] Gerard Donnelly: But you must start off conservatively, okay?
[00:51:51] Gerard Donnelly: Yep.
[00:51:53] Gerard Donnelly: So this is given in 3.59 to 4.28 pace, all right?
[00:51:57] Gerard Donnelly: Okay.
[00:51:58] Gerard Donnelly: Let's go.
[00:51:58] Gerard Donnelly: Let's go.
[00:52:01] Gerard Donnelly: And I think that I would agree with him, Abby, that's too conservative.
[00:52:05] Gerard Donnelly: Okay.
[00:52:06] Gerard Donnelly: You already run 21.02 in the second half of a 5K.
[00:52:10] Gerard Donnelly: So, and that's kind of a little bit of coaching you needed to have looked at so that he could say, this coach doesn't know what he's talking about, doesn't know what she's talking about.
[00:52:23] Gerard Donnelly: Because I've already ran, you know, if I knew my own data and I was, I was Glenn, I'd say, hang on, I've already run a 21.02, 5K in that last 10K.
[00:52:34] Gerard Donnelly: What's she talking about?
[00:52:37] Gerard Donnelly: Okay.
[00:52:38] Gerard Donnelly: Yep.
[00:52:39] Gerard Donnelly: All right, Mario.
[00:52:44] Gerard Donnelly: Doing good.
[00:52:47] Abby Jorgensen: I up to his FTP again, just a little bit, because he said this week, well, still a little easier.
[00:52:58] Abby Jorgensen: Like his heart rate doesn't get.
[00:53:00] Abby Jorgensen: Like super high.
[00:53:01] Abby Jorgensen: Yeah.
[00:53:05] Gerard Donnelly: And he's got the cadence, right?
[00:53:07] Gerard Donnelly: Mm-hmm.
[00:53:08] Gerard Donnelly: And he's going well.
[00:53:09] Gerard Donnelly: That's good.
[00:53:09] Gerard Donnelly: Yeah.
[00:53:13] Gerard Donnelly: He's just starting to get it up there in the end.
[00:53:17] Gerard Donnelly: No, that's right.
[00:53:18] Gerard Donnelly: That's good.
[00:53:19] Gerard Donnelly: If you think he's coping.
[00:53:21] Abby Jorgensen: Yeah.
[00:53:23] Abby Jorgensen: Because I messaged him and he's, yeah.
[00:53:27] Abby Jorgensen: It's easy at times.
[00:53:29] Gerard Donnelly: That's a worry.
[00:53:30] Gerard Donnelly: Yeah.
[00:53:30] Gerard Donnelly: That's why I was like, well.
[00:53:32] Gerard Donnelly: Yeah.
[00:53:33] Gerard Donnelly: That does look like Erg mode to me.
[00:53:35] Gerard Donnelly: Erg smoothing.
[00:53:36] Gerard Donnelly: Yeah.
[00:53:39] Abby Jorgensen: I'm going to figure out his trainer.
[00:53:43] Abby Jorgensen: Yeah.
[00:53:43] Gerard Donnelly: to figure out his trainer.
[00:53:56] Gerard Donnelly: See his range, 150 to 160.
[00:53:59] Gerard Donnelly: Yeah.
[00:54:03] Abby Jorgensen: He's doing 153.
[00:54:04] Gerard Donnelly: If someone says to me it's too easy, tell them to go higher, the upper end of the range.
[00:54:12] Gerard Donnelly: What's he doing?
[00:54:14] Gerard Donnelly: He's doing it at lower end.
[00:54:17] Gerard Donnelly: I want to see him at 160.
[00:54:21] Gerard Donnelly: Okay?
[00:54:22] Gerard Donnelly: Okay.
[00:54:23] Gerard Donnelly: He can't write it's too easy.
[00:54:27] Gerard Donnelly: If it's too easy, go higher, the end.
[00:54:33] Gerard Donnelly: So for Tuesday's session, tell him, oh, you forced him into the 158 anyway.
[00:54:42] Gerard Donnelly: Yeah.
[00:54:43] Gerard Donnelly: So tell him, you know, it shouldn't be easy.
[00:54:47] Gerard Donnelly: It should be, you should be struggling.
[00:54:49] Gerard Donnelly: Yeah.
[00:54:51] Gerard Donnelly: Yeah.
[00:54:53] Gerard Donnelly: Otherwise, he's got it right.
[00:54:55] Gerard Donnelly: Yeah, he said his swim felt a little better today.
[00:54:58] Abby Jorgensen: So that's a positive for him.
[00:55:00] Gerard Donnelly: Yeah, he's not, he can't work out his watch yet.
[00:55:03] Gerard Donnelly: Yeah, I don't know.
[00:55:04] Abby Jorgensen: I kept telling him, like, just, I mean, I think they think that it's going to count some of the drills too, but some of the drills don't always count.
[00:55:14] Gerard Donnelly: Yeah, the drills get confused.
[00:55:16] Gerard Donnelly: The watch gets confused with drills.
[00:55:18] Gerard Donnelly: Yeah.
[00:55:21] Abby Jorgensen: Yeah, if I wear paddles, my watch doesn't know what's happening, which is weird, I think.
[00:55:27] Gerard Donnelly: It is weird, isn't it?
[00:55:28] Abby Jorgensen: It'll, like, always miss, like, 25 yards, 25 to 50 yards.
[00:55:37] Gerard Donnelly: Abby, was trying to work out why the swim session looks like that.
[00:55:42] Gerard Donnelly: Oh, yeah, he's never tested, so I guess we never put in.
[00:55:47] Abby Jorgensen: What pace is he?
[00:55:53] Abby Jorgensen: I don't know, like a 2.30 maybe.
[00:55:56] Abby Jorgensen: Yeah, okay.
[00:55:57] Gerard Donnelly: that's
[00:56:03] Gerard Donnelly: My screen's gone blank.
[00:56:05] Gerard Donnelly: Uh oh.
[00:56:06] Abby Jorgensen: Oh, here we go.
[00:56:08] Gerard Donnelly: Where are we?
[00:56:09] Gerard Donnelly: Screen speed.
[00:56:22] Gerard Donnelly: That could be contributing to something.
[00:56:28] Abby Jorgensen: Okay, yeah, I guess we'll see.
[00:56:35] Abby Jorgensen: I was wondering why those sessions were weird.
[00:56:41] Gerard Donnelly: It shouldn't look like that.
[00:56:43] Gerard Donnelly: So now it should change.
[00:56:50] Gerard Donnelly: Oh, come on.
[00:56:53] Abby Jorgensen: No.
[00:56:54] Gerard Donnelly: Yes, that's good.
[00:56:55] Gerard Donnelly: Okay.
[00:56:57] Abby Jorgensen: That makes sense, huh?
[00:56:58] Abby Jorgensen: Yep.
[00:56:59] Abby Jorgensen: Thanks.
[00:56:59] Gerard Donnelly: you.
[00:57:00] Gerard Donnelly: What is happening?
[00:57:02] Abby Jorgensen: But for him, I just want, yeah, I want him to get comfortable.
[00:57:08] Gerard Donnelly: Yeah, that's right.
[00:57:09] Abby Jorgensen: I told him to go buy a snorkel and fins, and he said that's next.
[00:57:13] Abby Jorgensen: He needs to go buy that, so.
[00:57:15] Abby Jorgensen: Yep.
[00:57:19] Gerard Donnelly: I just want to check one more thing on his swim.
[00:57:32] Gerard Donnelly: Yeah, it's showing right now.
[00:57:34] Gerard Donnelly: Yep.
[00:57:35] Gerard Donnelly: Okay.
[00:57:42] Gerard Donnelly: Right.
[00:57:43] Gerard Donnelly: Philippe, he's a good value, he?
[00:57:45] Gerard Donnelly: Yeah, he texted me this morning.
[00:57:50] Abby Jorgensen: He's like, I tried to take it easy in the mountains, but it was too nice of skiing.
[00:57:58] Abby Jorgensen: So, he's going to.
[00:58:00] Abby Jorgensen: Take the run off today, probably.
[00:58:03] Abby Jorgensen: His calves are tight and stuff.
[00:58:06] Abby Jorgensen: Yep.
[00:58:09] Abby Jorgensen: So, but other than that, yeah.
[00:58:12] Gerard Donnelly: Maybe we need to have no runs on a Monday and have that run on Tuesday.
[00:58:18] Gerard Donnelly: Okay.
[00:58:19] Gerard Donnelly: And then move the steady state to Thursday and then just do the easy run Friday, have back-to-back.
[00:58:26] Gerard Donnelly: Okay.
[00:58:27] Gerard Donnelly: Because we can't afford to miss that run.
[00:58:29] Gerard Donnelly: Yeah.
[00:58:31] Gerard Donnelly: Do you want to discuss that with him maybe?
[00:58:36] Gerard Donnelly: Yeah.
[00:58:37] Abby Jorgensen: I told him to let me know how he feels tomorrow.
[00:58:40] Gerard Donnelly: Yep.
[00:58:42] Gerard Donnelly: Yep.
[00:58:42] Gerard Donnelly: Figure out.
[00:58:43] Gerard Donnelly: I would rather he doesn't miss the run.
[00:58:48] Gerard Donnelly: And then just do back-to-back runs at the end of the week.
[00:58:55] Abby Jorgensen: Okay.
[00:58:55] Abby Jorgensen: Okay.
[00:58:56] Abby Jorgensen: Yep.
[00:58:57] Gerard Donnelly: Erin?
[00:58:58] Abby Jorgensen: Erin, she's, uh...
[00:58:59] Abby Jorgensen: uh...
[00:58:59] Abby Jorgensen: uh...
[00:58:59] Abby Jorgensen: you.
[00:59:00] Abby Jorgensen: Back in the States and back on it for now.
[00:59:08] Abby Jorgensen: So she has, we put her goals in, but.
[00:59:13] Abby Jorgensen: Good, very good.
[00:59:15] Gerard Donnelly: Other than that.
[00:59:17] Gerard Donnelly: Oh, my God, she's miles away from this.
[00:59:19] Gerard Donnelly: That is, that's crazy talk.
[00:59:27] Gerard Donnelly: Things will have to change if she's wanting to do an Ironman.
[00:59:31] Abby Jorgensen: Yeah.
[00:59:32] Abby Jorgensen: I mean, I think she's motivated.
[00:59:35] Abby Jorgensen: I mean, she does have some travel coming up, but I asked her what we're going to do.
[00:59:40] Abby Jorgensen: And she's like, just put in normal.
[00:59:42] Abby Jorgensen: should have access to a gym.
[00:59:45] Abby Jorgensen: And so.
[00:59:46] Gerard Donnelly: How long is she away in Dubai for?
[00:59:48] Gerard Donnelly: I think just the week.
[00:59:50] Abby Jorgensen: Yeah.
[00:59:50] Abby Jorgensen: Okay.
[00:59:51] Abby Jorgensen: Yeah.
[00:59:52] Abby Jorgensen: All right.
[00:59:52] Abby Jorgensen: Riley.
[00:59:54] Abby Jorgensen: Riley is testing this week, I believe.
[00:59:58] Abby Jorgensen: We had.
[01:00:00] Gerard Donnelly: We wanted to talk to him about, was it Cadence, was it?
[01:00:05] Gerard Donnelly: Discussing with him last week that we, he wasn't doing.
[01:00:12] Abby Jorgensen: I can't remember, don't remember anything.
[01:00:17] Abby Jorgensen: Yeah, I was worried about his Cadence.
[01:00:20] Gerard Donnelly: I know, that's him.
[01:00:22] Gerard Donnelly: Oh yeah, he's got that going good.
[01:00:26] Abby Jorgensen: Yeah, I, yeah, I don't know.
[01:00:28] Abby Jorgensen: He, he got outside this weekend for the first time on his TT bike, but I had a talk with him today about like, like his race ready stuff's going to come up and I'll need a different route because he said it's a nice trail, but it's a trail so that you have, you have a lot of little blind turns and stuff and get a lot of freewheeling time navigating that stuff.
[01:00:56] Abby Jorgensen: So, So, So, You
[01:01:02] Gerard Donnelly: Yeah, and so that's the thing that you would say, and you already have, I imagine?
[01:01:09] Gerard Donnelly: Yeah, I talked to him today, this morning about it.
[01:01:12] Gerard Donnelly: Yeah, that's just 40% of the ride is under 128 watts.
[01:01:18] Abby Jorgensen: Yeah, when he can ride like upper 200, so.
[01:01:22] Abby Jorgensen: And it's great, the big tick, 100k, fantastic.
[01:01:27] Gerard Donnelly: But yeah, we need to have more pressure on the pedals.
[01:01:33] Gerard Donnelly: And he needs to take off the settings, Abby.
[01:01:37] Gerard Donnelly: It's set for five miles.
[01:01:40] Gerard Donnelly: Yeah.
[01:01:41] Gerard Donnelly: So we want him to be in charge of the lap function, and it's automatically clicking every five miles.
[01:01:49] Gerard Donnelly: So, okay?
[01:01:52] Gerard Donnelly: Yep.
[01:01:53] Gerard Donnelly: But he's training well, isn't he?
[01:01:55] Gerard Donnelly: He's training really well.
[01:01:57] Gerard Donnelly: Yeah.
[01:01:59] Gerard Donnelly: Good stuff.
[01:02:00] Gerard Donnelly: Uh, how far away is his race?
[01:02:03] Gerard Donnelly: Uh, is it 12 this week?
[01:02:12] Abby Jorgensen: Or whatever, yeah.
[01:02:14] Gerard Donnelly: Ironman, Texas, .
[01:02:17] Gerard Donnelly: Holy dolly, it's 12 weeks away, Jesus.
[01:02:21] Gerard Donnelly: I know.
[01:02:24] Gerard Donnelly: That's good, you're getting a half hour done.
[01:02:26] Gerard Donnelly: So he's done a 4-hour, 150.
[01:02:31] Gerard Donnelly: So he's been doing 140, yep.
[01:02:39] Gerard Donnelly: We really need to ramp his endurance rides up.
[01:02:45] Gerard Donnelly: yeah, so these next two weeks after testing, um, I, how many weeks is it?
[01:02:54] Gerard Donnelly: 12, did I say?
[01:02:55] Gerard Donnelly: Yeah.
[01:02:56] Gerard Donnelly: Yeah, I would, I would keep pushing in for the long endurance ride.
[01:03:01] Gerard Donnelly: Like a five-hour bunch?
[01:03:02] Gerard Donnelly: Yeah, four and a half to five hours that week, and then five hours the next week.
[01:03:10] Gerard Donnelly: And his long run needs to be, you know, two hours 20, two hours 30, just like you were doing.
[01:03:19] Gerard Donnelly: So, yeah, so after this testing week, this next two weeks, yeah, keep the normal programming going.
[01:03:27] Gerard Donnelly: During the week?
[01:03:30] Gerard Donnelly: Yeah, during the week.
[01:03:31] Gerard Donnelly: Sorry, my screen just keeps going blank.
[01:03:37] Gerard Donnelly: So you did descending strength if it's 60 to 60.
[01:03:41] Gerard Donnelly: So do the threshold stuff over under the...
[01:03:50] Gerard Donnelly: Just the regular threshold over under?
[01:03:52] Abby Jorgensen: Yes.
[01:03:55] Gerard Donnelly: This one?
[01:03:56] Gerard Donnelly: Yeah.
[01:03:57] Gerard Donnelly: Let's start at session six.
[01:03:59] Gerard Donnelly: six.
[01:04:00] Gerard Donnelly: I can put it here for you.
[01:04:02] Gerard Donnelly: Okay.
[01:04:10] Gerard Donnelly: And you had him doing 60-60s, and what was he doing on the block before?
[01:04:20] Gerard Donnelly: Sorry, screen's gone blank again.
[01:04:24] Gerard Donnelly: He did 3x8, and yeah, that's good.
[01:04:29] Gerard Donnelly: So maybe we're giving him a block of 40-20s.
[01:04:34] Gerard Donnelly: And just check that he hasn't done that, Abby, when you get a chance.
[01:04:40] Gerard Donnelly: I know he's done it, but it's been a while.
[01:04:44] Abby Jorgensen: Yep.
[01:04:45] Gerard Donnelly: So it'll be a couple weeks of it.
[01:04:48] Gerard Donnelly: And the bunch ride?
[01:04:52] Gerard Donnelly: I call it bunch ride.
[01:04:53] Gerard Donnelly: He's not actually in a bunch.
[01:04:55] Gerard Donnelly: Wow.
[01:04:58] Gerard Donnelly: But we want it to be, you
[01:05:00] Gerard Donnelly: I'm just changing this to read 4 to 4.30.
[01:05:06] Gerard Donnelly: Okay?
[01:05:07] Gerard Donnelly: Okay.
[01:05:09] Gerard Donnelly: That doesn't make sense.
[01:05:12] Gerard Donnelly: 34 hours.
[01:05:15] Gerard Donnelly: And you're really encouraging him to pick a course where he can not have, so if he's looking at his power, it needs to be, what's his settings, Abby, can you remember what his zone two is?
[01:05:31] Gerard Donnelly: Zone two?
[01:05:32] Abby Jorgensen: Oh.
[01:05:32] Abby Jorgensen: That's hard to remember.
[01:05:34] Gerard Donnelly: I mean, I'm good at yours, but not.
[01:05:39] Gerard Donnelly: So telling him we want him in zone two the majority of the time.
[01:05:42] Gerard Donnelly: So just go into TrainingPeaks.
[01:05:45] Gerard Donnelly: And yeah, we want him up around that 170 for the majority of the time.
[01:05:51] Gerard Donnelly: Okay.
[01:05:52] Gerard Donnelly: Okay.
[01:05:53] Gerard Donnelly: If he's FTP set right at 2.30, is that right?
[01:05:56] Gerard Donnelly: Yep.
[01:05:56] Gerard Donnelly: Yep.
[01:05:57] Abby Jorgensen: Yep.
[01:05:58] Abby Jorgensen: So we want him We
[01:06:00] Gerard Donnelly: We want him in here for the majority of the time, know, 150 to 170, okay?
[01:06:07] Gerard Donnelly: And that's what he needs to be looking at.
[01:06:12] Gerard Donnelly: So if he comes to any hills, you know, try and let him get up to 200 watts.
[01:06:18] Gerard Donnelly: If it's downhills, it's okay to be, you know, above 129, but he can't be below 128.
[01:06:26] Gerard Donnelly: He's just got to keep the pressure on the pedals.
[01:06:28] Gerard Donnelly: No, nothing in zone one.
[01:06:30] Gerard Donnelly: All right, so that's kind of what you try to...
[01:06:33] Abby Jorgensen: Pretty flat out there, so...
[01:06:35] Gerard Donnelly: Yeah.
[01:06:40] Gerard Donnelly: All right.
[01:06:46] Gerard Donnelly: So testing this week, it's good.
[01:06:51] Gerard Donnelly: I would give him a bit more of an endurance ride after that.
[01:06:55] Gerard Donnelly: Okay.
[01:06:56] Gerard Donnelly: Even though it's recovery week, just that I didn't realize it's only 12 weeks away.
[01:07:00] Gerard Donnelly: Okay.
[01:07:01] Abby Jorgensen: So like zone instead of a recovery?
[01:07:04] Gerard Donnelly: Yeah, zone two.
[01:07:07] Gerard Donnelly: And if he can get outside, it would be great on his TT bike.
[01:07:11] Gerard Donnelly: Okay.
[01:07:13] Gerard Donnelly: And if he's going to train outside in the next 12 weeks, in the middle of the week, is it all going to be on the trainer, do you think, in the middle of the week?
[01:07:23] Abby Jorgensen: Probably the middle of the week, I would say, based off of his work.
[01:07:27] Abby Jorgensen: Yeah.
[01:07:28] Gerard Donnelly: We do need to test him outdoors, Abby, and indoors.
[01:07:35] Gerard Donnelly: So, you know, we could actually get him to do a 60-minute outdoor here, rather than an endurance ride, and swap this around, the run afterwards.
[01:07:46] Abby Jorgensen: Okay.
[01:07:47] Gerard Donnelly: And he'll go, two FTPs in the one week, and you go, yeah, one's indoor, one's outdoor.
[01:07:53] Gerard Donnelly: You okay with that?
[01:07:54] Gerard Donnelly: Yeah.
[01:07:55] Gerard Donnelly: Yeah.
[01:07:55] Abby Jorgensen: I'll text him and see if he can find, like, 50-minute.
[01:08:00] Gerard Donnelly: He only needs 15 minutes out and back twice, okay?
[01:08:05] Gerard Donnelly: And tell him, I don't want him to do 30 minutes out and back.
[01:08:07] Gerard Donnelly: I want him to do 15 minutes out and back.
[01:08:13] Gerard Donnelly: Oh, where is it?
[01:08:18] Gerard Donnelly: I've only used this 10 billion times.
[01:08:20] Gerard Donnelly: I'm going to find the damn thing.
[01:08:23] Abby Jorgensen: Sometimes there's a lot of them to go through.
[01:08:26] Gerard Donnelly: Yeah.
[01:08:30] Gerard Donnelly: Are okay with that?
[01:08:32] Gerard Donnelly: Yeah.
[01:08:34] Abby Jorgensen: And let's just get rid of that.
[01:08:36] Gerard Donnelly: The weather.
[01:08:38] Abby Jorgensen: It's Houston.
[01:08:40] Gerard Donnelly: And if the weather's bad, swap days, obviously.
[01:08:46] Gerard Donnelly: And you think he's capable of a 2.15 half?
[01:08:49] Gerard Donnelly: that...
[01:08:54] Abby Jorgensen: I mean, that was...
[01:08:55] Abby Jorgensen: I just pulled it over.
[01:08:59] Abby Jorgensen: I need to change.
[01:08:59] Abby Jorgensen: I need need need to change.
[01:08:59] Abby Jorgensen: change.
[01:09:11] Gerard Donnelly: He hasn't done further than 15K, is that right?
[01:09:16] Abby Jorgensen: Yeah, like his longest run is, what, two hours or 150?
[01:09:22] Abby Jorgensen: Yeah, okay.
[01:09:27] Gerard Donnelly: Yeah, he's, is that his PB, yeah, that's a 10K.
[01:09:34] Abby Jorgensen: Okay, he did PB in the last 10K.
[01:09:37] Gerard Donnelly: the way to check whether you think he can do this, is start in a McMillan.
[01:09:45] Gerard Donnelly: Put that in.
[01:09:47] Gerard Donnelly: Yeah, so you put a, yep, and then check what McMillan says, can you do that?
[01:09:52] Gerard Donnelly: Have you done that?
[01:09:54] Abby Jorgensen: I can't remember, I've done it for several people, I'm trying to remember who I've done it for.
[01:09:59] Gerard Donnelly: So, just start with you.
[01:10:01] Abby Jorgensen: Half Marathon, what was it, one?
[01:10:05] Gerard Donnelly: 101.26.
[01:10:12] Abby Jorgensen: 101.26.
[01:10:16] Abby Jorgensen: And then what do I have for the 216, 215?
[01:10:25] Gerard Donnelly: 215, yeah, 215.
[01:10:28] Gerard Donnelly: What's it, McMillan saying?
[01:10:31] Gerard Donnelly: Let's see here.
[01:10:36] Abby Jorgensen: Yeah, it has 216.57.
[01:10:40] Gerard Donnelly: Okay, so we'd probably say that's too hard for him, okay?
[01:10:44] Gerard Donnelly: And remember, McMillan is saying this is what you would expect to do in a race, and this is not a race, this is a training session.
[01:10:52] Gerard Donnelly: Okay.
[01:10:53] Gerard Donnelly: So can you manipulate this so that it adds up to 220?
[01:10:58] Gerard Donnelly: Yep.
[01:10:58] Gerard Donnelly: So you know how to do that, don't
[01:11:00] Gerard Donnelly: Yeah.
[01:11:00] Gerard Donnelly: Yep.
[01:11:01] Gerard Donnelly: Yep.
[01:11:02] Gerard Donnelly: So change this.
[01:11:04] Gerard Donnelly: That's setting him up for Fathom, Abby, and he'll lose confidence.
[01:11:07] Gerard Donnelly: So.
[01:11:07] Gerard Donnelly: Okay.
[01:11:09] Abby Jorgensen: Is that giving, am I, do I have that correct?
[01:11:12] Abby Jorgensen: That it gives you the middle of what you would finish if you hit the middle range of all those?
[01:11:19] Gerard Donnelly: Yeah, that's right.
[01:11:21] Gerard Donnelly: Exactly right.
[01:11:22] Gerard Donnelly: Yeah.
[01:11:23] Gerard Donnelly: So.
[01:11:25] Gerard Donnelly: So, so you would, you would say, okay, I'm going to pull this back to 90 to 94 and then pull this back 94 to 98.
[01:11:41] Gerard Donnelly: And then I'm continually checking.
[01:11:43] Gerard Donnelly: What does that give me?
[01:11:44] Gerard Donnelly: Right.
[01:11:44] Gerard Donnelly: I'll you 219.
[01:11:46] Gerard Donnelly: So I'm going to check, pull this back to 88 to 92.
[01:11:50] Gerard Donnelly: That's a 90.
[01:11:51] Gerard Donnelly: Maybe 92.
[01:11:52] Gerard Donnelly: I'll just check.
[01:11:53] Gerard Donnelly: No.
[01:11:56] Gerard Donnelly: Yep.
[01:11:56] Gerard Donnelly: I've now reached my goal.
[01:11:58] Gerard Donnelly: And.
[01:12:00] Gerard Donnelly: And that's 88.
[01:12:04] Gerard Donnelly: The screen's gone blank.
[01:12:06] Gerard Donnelly: 88.
[01:12:09] Gerard Donnelly: And then you just have to change these settings here, which you can do.
[01:12:14] Gerard Donnelly: Yeah.
[01:12:15] Gerard Donnelly: Yeah.
[01:12:15] Gerard Donnelly: So we've got him set at 220.
[01:12:16] Gerard Donnelly: And you need to have a discussion.
[01:12:19] Gerard Donnelly: Hey, you haven't run further than 18K or whatever.
[01:12:24] Gerard Donnelly: What's his longest run?
[01:12:26] Gerard Donnelly: 15?
[01:12:27] Gerard Donnelly: 15?
[01:12:32] Gerard Donnelly: 13?
[01:12:42] Gerard Donnelly: Yeah, this is going to be a big ask, Abby.
[01:12:45] Gerard Donnelly: That's what I was wondering.
[01:12:46] Gerard Donnelly: I didn't know, but it's to the point where...
[01:12:51] Gerard Donnelly: Yeah, this might be a bad idea.
[01:12:56] Abby Jorgensen: Should we just do the 60-minuter and then give him...
[01:12:59] Abby Jorgensen: Yeah.
[01:13:00] Abby Jorgensen: Just another long run?
[01:13:02] Abby Jorgensen: Yeah.
[01:13:03] Abby Jorgensen: Because he does have a half marathon in what?
[01:13:06] Abby Jorgensen: Yeah.
[01:13:07] Abby Jorgensen: How many weeks?
[01:13:10] Abby Jorgensen: Yeah, I think that's a better idea.
[01:13:15] Gerard Donnelly: Let's change that.
[01:13:17] Gerard Donnelly: Let's just make it one hour 50.
[01:13:24] Gerard Donnelly: Yeah, let's get him to do a 205.
[01:13:27] Gerard Donnelly: Yeah.
[01:13:33] Abby Jorgensen: Okay.
[01:13:34] Abby Jorgensen: Yeah, I think that was one question I had for you on him because he's just like such a slow runner that it's...
[01:13:41] Abby Jorgensen: Yeah.
[01:13:43] Gerard Donnelly: That when you...
[01:13:45] Gerard Donnelly: Okay, so give him the opportunity to run two hours to 210.
[01:13:50] Gerard Donnelly: Okay.
[01:13:52] Abby Jorgensen: If my screen will come back on, here it is.
[01:13:56] Gerard Donnelly: And say they've changed their mind, that's going to be too hard for you.
[01:14:00] Gerard Donnelly: And we'll do that another day.
[01:14:02] Gerard Donnelly: Okay.
[01:14:04] Gerard Donnelly: All right.
[01:14:08] Gerard Donnelly: Good.
[01:14:15] Gerard Donnelly: Peter.
[01:14:17] Abby Jorgensen: Did you guys get his email?
[01:14:19] Abby Jorgensen: No.
[01:14:21] Abby Jorgensen: He lost his job or he got laid off.
[01:14:26] Abby Jorgensen: So he said he sent an email.
[01:14:29] Abby Jorgensen: At least I got it.
[01:14:30] Abby Jorgensen: It had you guys attached to it.
[01:14:33] Gerard Donnelly: Did I miss it, Peter?
[01:14:52] Gerard Donnelly: That's August the 20th.
[01:14:54] Gerard Donnelly: That's the last.
[01:14:57] Abby Jorgensen: That's last email.
[01:14:59] Gerard Donnelly: That's.
[01:15:01] Gerard Donnelly: Here, let me see if I can forward it to you.
[01:15:04] Abby Jorgensen: So he wants to stop living?
[01:15:07] Abby Jorgensen: Well, he wants to pause it because he doesn't have a job.
[01:15:10] Abby Jorgensen: Right.
[01:15:11] Abby Jorgensen: But he doesn't want to stop training.
[01:15:14] Abby Jorgensen: So, because I was like, yeah, you finally just got in your groove.
[01:15:18] Abby Jorgensen: So I was like, well, I'll just send Jared and Jordan an email explaining your situation.
[01:15:28] Abby Jorgensen: Let's see here.
[01:15:30] Abby Jorgensen: When did he send that, Abby?
[01:15:31] Gerard Donnelly: He sent it Saturday, Sunday, I think.
[01:15:36] Abby Jorgensen: Let me see if this comes through.
[01:15:45] Abby Jorgensen: Thank you.
[01:15:47] Abby Jorgensen: Thank Thank you.
[01:15:55] Abby Jorgensen: Thank you.
[01:15:58] Abby Jorgensen: Thank you.
[01:16:09] Abby Jorgensen: Anything come through on your end?
[01:16:12] Abby Jorgensen: Yeah, I can't even get my screen to.
[01:16:29] Gerard Donnelly: Okay, yep, it's come through.
[01:16:55] Abby Jorgensen: Thank you.
[01:17:14] Gerard Donnelly: So what is he saying?
[01:17:15] Gerard Donnelly: On the plus side, I'll be able to train more, which is fine.
[01:17:19] Gerard Donnelly: Any chance we can draft a plan to keep me going in the right direction?
[01:17:24] Gerard Donnelly: What did you mean, Abby?
[01:17:25] Gerard Donnelly: Do you want us to...
[01:17:28] Abby Jorgensen: Yeah, I mean, he says that he wants to pause it because he can't, he probably can't afford it until he gets another job.
[01:17:35] Abby Jorgensen: Yep.
[01:17:37] Abby Jorgensen: But also doesn't want to stop training, so it's...
[01:17:41] Gerard Donnelly: But when he says, can we draft a plan, would you want us to do that for free?
[01:17:48] Gerard Donnelly: Yeah, I don't know.
[01:17:50] Abby Jorgensen: Like, I was like, I mean, can't really keep training or, like, training you without pay, but...
[01:17:59] Abby Jorgensen: ...
[01:17:59] Abby Jorgensen: ...
[01:17:59] Abby Jorgensen: ...
[01:18:00] Abby Jorgensen: I was like, I don't know what else to tell them.
[01:18:04] Abby Jorgensen: Well, I don't know why that didn't come through to me, or Jordan.
[01:18:09] Gerard Donnelly: Yeah.
[01:18:14] Gerard Donnelly: I'm getting so distracted because this screen is now just staying off.
[01:18:22] Gerard Donnelly: Your computer or the internet?
[01:18:23] Gerard Donnelly: Yeah.
[01:18:25] Gerard Donnelly: No, I've got a lead that seems to be.
[01:18:37] Abby Jorgensen: Hey, morning, mate.
[01:18:39] Gerard Donnelly: I'm in the middle of a call.
[01:18:40] Gerard Donnelly: Can I call you back?
[01:18:41] Gerard Donnelly: Yeah, no, drive it, mate.
[01:18:43] Gerard Donnelly: See you, I'm sure I'll just call you back as soon as I can.
[01:18:45] Gerard Donnelly: Yep, okay.
[01:18:46] Gerard Donnelly: See you, mate.
[01:18:46] Gerard Donnelly: Bye.
[01:18:50] Gerard Donnelly: That's a real Aussie talking there.
[01:18:55] Abby Jorgensen: I like that.
[01:18:56] Abby Jorgensen: that.
[01:18:57] Abby Jorgensen: Oh.
[01:18:57] Abby Jorgensen: I like you.
[01:19:00] Gerard Donnelly: God's sake, on.
[01:19:03] Gerard Donnelly: Let's just give up.
[01:19:08] Gerard Donnelly: This is just a joke.
[01:19:18] Gerard Donnelly: Okay, we'll start on your screen.
[01:19:50] Gerard Donnelly: It's very hard to work.
[01:19:52] Gerard Donnelly: It's not working.
[01:19:55] Gerard Donnelly: Technology.
[01:20:00] Gerard Donnelly: It's like there's a short in the code or something.
[01:20:21] Gerard Donnelly: Yeah.
[01:20:23] Gerard Donnelly: There it is.
[01:20:24] Gerard Donnelly: Sorry.
[01:20:27] Abby Jorgensen: There we go.
[01:20:28] Gerard Donnelly: Yep.
[01:20:28] Gerard Donnelly: So let me let me talk to Jordan.
[01:20:34] Gerard Donnelly: What did you how did you respond?
[01:20:37] Abby Jorgensen: Oh, I mean, I was like, well, I mean, I was like, like, feel bad for him because it was like, you know, what do you say?
[01:20:43] Abby Jorgensen: Like, you lost your job.
[01:20:45] Abby Jorgensen: I'm like, and he had just just gotten into a groove.
[01:20:50] Abby Jorgensen: And I felt like we were, you know, kind of kind of clicking.
[01:20:54] Abby Jorgensen: And then, you know, it comes with that news.
[01:20:56] Abby Jorgensen: So it's like, I don't, you know, I didn't know, really know what to say.
[01:20:59] Abby Jorgensen: don't I know.
[01:21:00] Abby Jorgensen: But I was just like, you know, explain your situation and we'll go.
[01:21:04] Abby Jorgensen: I was like, already have your next week planned out, so you can go ahead and train.
[01:21:08] Gerard Donnelly: But after that, I don't know.
[01:21:13] Gerard Donnelly: Okay.
[01:21:21] Gerard Donnelly: Sorry.
[01:21:26] Gerard Donnelly: I can't even concentrate.
[01:21:27] Gerard Donnelly: It just comes on and off.
[01:21:28] Gerard Donnelly: It just comes on and it comes off.
[01:21:30] Abby Jorgensen: Give you a seizure.
[01:21:34] Gerard Donnelly: All right.
[01:21:35] Gerard Donnelly: I'll talk to Jordan.
[01:21:36] Gerard Donnelly: Let's just go ahead with coaching him as normal.
[01:21:40] Gerard Donnelly: And we'll...
[01:21:44] Abby Jorgensen: I mean, he's confident he'll find another job.
[01:21:47] Abby Jorgensen: Yeah.
[01:21:48] Gerard Donnelly: But I felt bad, too, because I was like, this is what happened kind of last year.
[01:21:53] Abby Jorgensen: He started late with us and didn't get a full block.
[01:21:56] Abby Jorgensen: And I don't want him to...
[01:21:59] Abby Jorgensen: to...
[01:22:07] Gerard Donnelly: Dan, Dan, Dan's doing good.
[01:22:18] Gerard Donnelly: I'm just going to try a new screen.
[01:22:20] Gerard Donnelly: This is just driving me insane.
[01:22:33] Gerard Donnelly: Stop sharing.
[01:22:36] Gerard Donnelly: Share new screen.
[01:22:46] Gerard Donnelly: Sorry, Abby.
[01:22:47] Gerard Donnelly: Oh, bye.
[01:22:49] Gerard Donnelly: You're okay.
[01:22:50] Gerard Donnelly: See you then.
[01:22:54] Gerard Donnelly: My dogs like it when I just sit here on the couch.
[01:22:57] Gerard Donnelly: It doesn't happen too often.
[01:23:11] Gerard Donnelly: Yep, I think I found a screen.
[01:23:17] Gerard Donnelly: Okay.
[01:23:19] Gerard Donnelly: A whole new screen.
[01:23:21] Gerard Donnelly: Right.
[01:23:22] Gerard Donnelly: Let's get to Abby.
[01:23:26] Gerard Donnelly: Dan.
[01:23:36] Gerard Donnelly: He's trying well, isn't he?
[01:23:38] Gerard Donnelly: Yeah.
[01:23:39] Abby Jorgensen: He's kind of got his mojo back, especially on the run.
[01:23:42] Abby Jorgensen: He had a moment with the run where he had a couple niggles, but now he's feeling good there.
[01:23:54] Gerard Donnelly: I'm in Texas as well.
[01:23:56] Gerard Donnelly: But that's a 70.3.
[01:23:59] Gerard Donnelly: Oh, great.
[01:23:59] Gerard Donnelly: He's just.
[01:24:00] Gerard Donnelly: Different.
[01:24:00] Gerard Donnelly: He's 70.3.
[01:24:01] Gerard Donnelly: Yep.
[01:24:01] Gerard Donnelly: Okay.
[01:24:02] Gerard Donnelly: Uh, okay.
[01:24:03] Gerard Donnelly: Uh, testing week.
[01:24:04] Gerard Donnelly: So nothing different there.
[01:24:05] Gerard Donnelly: That's great.
[01:24:09] Gerard Donnelly: anything else on, anything on Dan that I'm skimming over here?
[01:24:12] Gerard Donnelly: Uh, no.
[01:24:14] Abby Jorgensen: Um, no, he's good.
[01:24:15] Abby Jorgensen: I just had to have a, he's one that struggles with anxiety with testing.
[01:24:19] Abby Jorgensen: So I kind of had a talk with him today.
[01:24:21] Abby Jorgensen: Just, it's just a normal session.
[01:24:22] Abby Jorgensen: Just go, you hit all your normal sessions.
[01:24:25] Abby Jorgensen: So yeah, don't worry about anything.
[01:24:27] Gerard Donnelly: Did you give him a little bit of a race plan strategy?
[01:24:31] Gerard Donnelly: Yeah.
[01:24:31] Abby Jorgensen: I'm going to talk to him about, um, his FTP a little bit because he, his last couple have not been great, even though his training leading up to it has been good.
[01:24:42] Gerard Donnelly: He just gets it ahead.
[01:24:44] Gerard Donnelly: So.
[01:24:44] Abby Jorgensen: Yep.
[01:24:46] Gerard Donnelly: Um, what other?
[01:24:53] Gerard Donnelly: So 283, he did the last test and 302 before that wasn't it.
[01:24:58] Gerard Donnelly: Yeah.
[01:24:58] Abby Jorgensen: And he's been sitting.
[01:25:00] Abby Jorgensen: Sitting still at, like, 302 is, like, where he should be.
[01:25:03] Gerard Donnelly: Like, he hits all the numbers in training.
[01:25:13] Gerard Donnelly: Yeah, just tell him to start conservatively again.
[01:25:16] Gerard Donnelly: Yeah.
[01:25:18] Gerard Donnelly: Start in the low 280s.
[01:25:19] Gerard Donnelly: Definitely start in the low 280s, all right?
[01:25:21] Gerard Donnelly: Good, okay.
[01:25:22] Gerard Donnelly: High 270s.
[01:25:24] Gerard Donnelly: Just forget what you've done before in the 300s, that we have to have a successful session, okay?
[01:25:31] Gerard Donnelly: Yep.
[01:25:32] Gerard Donnelly: Yep, so just tell him, you talk to me and suggestion is you start 275.
[01:25:40] Gerard Donnelly: Does he have the same problem with the run or does he cope well?
[01:25:44] Gerard Donnelly: He's done a lot better with the run recently.
[01:25:47] Abby Jorgensen: He didn't test the run last time because of the injury.
[01:25:50] Abby Jorgensen: Yes, okay.
[01:25:51] Abby Jorgensen: But he, yeah, he tends to, he's gotten to the point where he used to, because he ran the, like, the marathon, like, he was a...
[01:26:00] Abby Jorgensen: And so we had to change his mindset.
[01:26:02] Abby Jorgensen: Like he's not the same type of runner.
[01:26:05] Abby Jorgensen: He was just training for like a marathon.
[01:26:08] Abby Jorgensen: So that's fine.
[01:26:10] Gerard Donnelly: Okay.
[01:26:12] Gerard Donnelly: So Jen, is there anything to speak about her?
[01:26:15] Gerard Donnelly: Cause she's done nothing since we last talked.
[01:26:17] Abby Jorgensen: No, told her to message me when she gets back in Australia, which should be sometime today.
[01:26:22] Abby Jorgensen: think he left in the wee hours last night or it would have been last night for us.
[01:26:29] Abby Jorgensen: So I don't know how long, how long does it take to get there?
[01:26:33] Gerard Donnelly: 24 hours.
[01:26:34] Gerard Donnelly: Yeah.
[01:26:35] Abby Jorgensen: So she might be just now getting in or maybe later.
[01:26:41] Abby Jorgensen: I don't know.
[01:26:41] Abby Jorgensen: Her mom said she had to leave at like her flight kept getting pushed back.
[01:26:45] Abby Jorgensen: So.
[01:26:45] Abby Jorgensen: And they lose the whole day.
[01:26:47] Gerard Donnelly: So it's.
[01:26:48] Gerard Donnelly: Yeah.
[01:26:49] Gerard Donnelly: Um, okay.
[01:26:51] Gerard Donnelly: Uh, so it'll be interesting conversation with her too.
[01:26:54] Gerard Donnelly: Yeah.
[01:26:55] Abby Jorgensen: I told her mom before she left, I was like, make a bet with her or something that you're going to be.
[01:27:00] Abby Jorgensen: I don't know, Kidder, Kidder, Kidding, but.
[01:27:03] Gerard Donnelly: Good tactic.
[01:27:05] Gerard Donnelly: What about Bill?
[01:27:06] Gerard Donnelly: What's Bill training for?
[01:27:09] Gerard Donnelly: He has, was it May?
[01:27:12] Abby Jorgensen: There's a 70.3 in May.
[01:27:14] Abby Jorgensen: There's like an off-brand one.
[01:27:16] Abby Jorgensen: And then Augusta.
[01:27:20] Abby Jorgensen: I don't think that's in there, but Augusta, Georgia, 70, or maybe it is.
[01:27:25] Abby Jorgensen: 70.3?
[01:27:26] Gerard Donnelly: Yeah.
[01:27:27] Gerard Donnelly: Yeah, great.
[01:27:28] Gerard Donnelly: Yeah, he's not going to do a full or anything this year, 70.3.
[01:27:32] Gerard Donnelly: He's testing, but he's sick.
[01:27:34] Abby Jorgensen: Yeah, so I told him just keep me informed every day.
[01:27:38] Gerard Donnelly: We'll push back things as needed.
[01:27:40] Gerard Donnelly: We won't test him if he's sick, Abby.
[01:27:42] Gerard Donnelly: There's no way.
[01:27:43] Gerard Donnelly: Yeah, that's what I told him.
[01:27:44] Abby Jorgensen: I was like, just text me every day and we'll go from there.
[01:27:50] Abby Jorgensen: Yep, okay.
[01:27:51] Gerard Donnelly: Albert?
[01:27:52] Abby Jorgensen: Albert just tested and improved everything.
[01:27:56] Abby Jorgensen: So he was really pumped last night.
[01:27:59] Abby Jorgensen: He texted me.
[01:28:00] Abby Jorgensen: to me after his run and was super psyched.
[01:28:03] Abby Jorgensen: I think he said a 5K PB inside the...
[01:28:09] Gerard Donnelly: That's great.
[01:28:14] Gerard Donnelly: He doesn't have peak performance.
[01:28:18] Gerard Donnelly: So 29.35, good.
[01:28:21] Abby Jorgensen: Yeah, I think it was like something last time.
[01:28:24] Gerard Donnelly: Yep, and he's done a 101, so that's great.
[01:28:31] Gerard Donnelly: Is that indoor or outdoor?
[01:28:32] Gerard Donnelly: That was indoor on the Assault Runner, yeah.
[01:28:36] Gerard Donnelly: It's even colder up there than...
[01:28:37] Gerard Donnelly: Well, they got slow too.
[01:28:40] Abby Jorgensen: What's he training towards?
[01:28:45] Abby Jorgensen: 70.3...
[01:28:46] Abby Jorgensen: I want to say July.
[01:28:53] Gerard Donnelly: Yeah, 70.3, Maine, good.
[01:28:56] Gerard Donnelly: Okay, 26 weeks, fantastic.
[01:28:58] Gerard Donnelly: Lots of time.
[01:28:59] Gerard Donnelly: great.
[01:28:59] Gerard Donnelly: Yeah.
[01:28:59] Gerard Donnelly: Yeah.
[01:29:00] Gerard Donnelly: That's my big worry, is if someone says an Ironman and I don't see enough endurance riding and running, I go into panic mode straight away.
[01:29:09] Gerard Donnelly: So you keep that in your mind, but, you know, what is this guy training for?
[01:29:13] Gerard Donnelly: Have we done enough endurance?
[01:29:16] Gerard Donnelly: Yeah, obviously 70.3 is a completely different story.
[01:29:18] Gerard Donnelly: We only run a half marathon there, only doing 90, 60-odd miles.
[01:29:26] Gerard Donnelly: Okay, but you feel that he's coping okay?
[01:29:30] Abby Jorgensen: Yeah, yeah, I think his FTP went up 10, maybe more than that, actually.
[01:29:44] Abby Jorgensen: Oh, 15.
[01:29:51] Abby Jorgensen: 15, fantastic.
[01:29:53] Gerard Donnelly: 15.
[01:29:54] Gerard Donnelly: He would be pumped with that.
[01:29:55] Abby Jorgensen: Yeah, he's pumped, and then his swim was like a minute.
[01:30:00] Abby Jorgensen: But he's a former swimmer, so everything started to re-click again for him.
[01:30:05] Gerard Donnelly: Yes.
[01:30:08] Gerard Donnelly: I'm just Googling him now.
[01:30:15] Gerard Donnelly: Albert.
[01:30:17] Gerard Donnelly: Yeah.
[01:30:18] Abby Jorgensen: Oof, 15 watts on the bike.
[01:30:22] Gerard Donnelly: Ah, that's great.
[01:30:24] Gerard Donnelly: Yeah.
[01:30:25] Gerard Donnelly: 29.38 and he did a 30.42.
[01:30:27] Gerard Donnelly: Oof, that's really good.
[01:30:31] Gerard Donnelly: Yeah.
[01:30:32] Abby Jorgensen: I feel like he's coping fairly well.
[01:30:36] Gerard Donnelly: Yeah.
[01:30:37] Abby Jorgensen: My only concern was like just the back-to-back running, but he seems to manage it pretty well.
[01:30:41] Gerard Donnelly: Yep.
[01:30:44] Gerard Donnelly: Karen, you happy with her compared to her daughter?
[01:30:47] Abby Jorgensen: Karen is, she's doing good.
[01:30:50] Abby Jorgensen: asks the right questions and wants to know if she's improving and stuff.
[01:30:56] Gerard Donnelly: Yeah.
[01:30:57] Gerard Donnelly: Did she test recently, Abby?
[01:30:59] Gerard Donnelly: Yeah.
[01:31:00] Gerard Donnelly: She has one more week left, and then she'll test.
[01:31:02] Gerard Donnelly: So she's in week three this week.
[01:31:06] Abby Jorgensen: She struggled in the beginning of this, but then once she found her right cadence and everything with that, she did good.
[01:31:13] Gerard Donnelly: Yep, all right.
[01:31:15] Gerard Donnelly: Well, she got away, is she?
[01:31:19] Gerard Donnelly: Yeah, skiing.
[01:31:20] Gerard Donnelly: Yep.
[01:31:22] Gerard Donnelly: So she might be able to do that.
[01:31:24] Gerard Donnelly: Has she got a race coming up?
[01:31:26] Abby Jorgensen: No, not till she has that one in July that she will do with Jen.
[01:31:32] Abby Jorgensen: Is that July?
[01:31:33] Gerard Donnelly: Yeah.
[01:31:35] Abby Jorgensen: Suncoast or whatever?
[01:31:36] Abby Jorgensen: Is that July?
[01:31:37] Abby Jorgensen: She's looking at doing some, like, Olympics and sprints once the summer hits here, but.
[01:31:43] Abby Jorgensen: I think it's September.
[01:31:45] Gerard Donnelly: Or maybe September.
[01:31:46] Gerard Donnelly: I know it's a ways away.
[01:31:48] Gerard Donnelly: There you go.
[01:31:50] Gerard Donnelly: Yep.
[01:31:52] Gerard Donnelly: Sunny Coast.
[01:31:54] Gerard Donnelly: Yep.
[01:31:57] Gerard Donnelly: Well, I'm confident Karen will do do that.
[01:32:00] Gerard Donnelly: I've got no confidence in general.
[01:32:02] Gerard Donnelly: I don't either.
[01:32:05] Gerard Donnelly: Now, Scott, I felt, was always going to be a problem because of his fatigue issues.
[01:32:10] Gerard Donnelly: How are you going with that?
[01:32:12] Gerard Donnelly: I mean, he's got sick.
[01:32:17] Abby Jorgensen: So, but other than that, like, I mean, he communicates really well.
[01:32:21] Abby Jorgensen: And he knows, like, that he's sick and we needed to pull back.
[01:32:28] Gerard Donnelly: Yep.
[01:32:29] Abby Jorgensen: And so he, you know, he's appreciative that we have, you know, that I'm not forcing him to, like, do anything when he's sick.
[01:32:36] Gerard Donnelly: And I was like, no, that's the whole point.
[01:32:40] Abby Jorgensen: And just give him rest days.
[01:32:42] Gerard Donnelly: I know you have, but.
[01:32:44] Gerard Donnelly: Yeah.
[01:32:45] Gerard Donnelly: He's got bronchitis.
[01:32:46] Gerard Donnelly: So I would say he shouldn't be training at him.
[01:32:49] Abby Jorgensen: Yeah, I told him, like, don't, like, I just had the stuff in there.
[01:32:53] Abby Jorgensen: And then because he's like, I feel better.
[01:32:55] Abby Jorgensen: And I was like, well, you can spin your legs.
[01:32:57] Abby Jorgensen: But, like, there's.
[01:32:59] Gerard Donnelly: Yeah.
[01:33:00] Gerard Donnelly: There's a point where resting is better off than spinning your legs.
[01:33:03] Gerard Donnelly: Yeah.
[01:33:06] Gerard Donnelly: Maybe I wouldn't get him in the pool when he's got bronchitis still.
[01:33:10] Gerard Donnelly: Okay.
[01:33:13] Gerard Donnelly: Yeah, stay away from germ-infested pools.
[01:33:19] Gerard Donnelly: If you feel like he's on the mend, did you say he's on the mend?
[01:33:22] Abby Jorgensen: Yeah, he said he felt good this morning.
[01:33:24] Gerard Donnelly: Yeah, I would just, when he wakes up, just send him a text message now to say, I've shared it with you, Andy.
[01:33:40] Gerard Donnelly: That we've changed their mind because of the illness with the swimming, and then you just adjust the sessions.
[01:33:50] Gerard Donnelly: And if you think he's good enough to swim, then let him, but say to him, look, you know, we don't think you should swim, we should just go for an easy run.
[01:33:58] Gerard Donnelly: Yeah.
[01:34:00] Gerard Donnelly: I want to know, is he okay?
[01:34:02] Gerard Donnelly: You know, today, on Monday?
[01:34:05] Gerard Donnelly: Yeah.
[01:34:06] Abby Jorgensen: I mean, I texted him this morning and he's like, I feel a lot better.
[01:34:10] Abby Jorgensen: So his heart rate goes back down to normal, like resting heart rate and stuff.
[01:34:16] Gerard Donnelly: Ask them, they 6 out of 10, 8 out of 10, 9 out of 10, 10 out of 10?
[01:34:21] Gerard Donnelly: That's going to be my gauge.
[01:34:23] Gerard Donnelly: Gauge, okay.
[01:34:24] Abby Jorgensen: Okay.
[01:34:25] Gerard Donnelly: Tell me on a scale of 1 to 10, where are you?
[01:34:27] Gerard Donnelly: Are you 6?
[01:34:28] Gerard Donnelly: Are you 8?
[01:34:29] Gerard Donnelly: If there's 6, I'm going to say, you're just doing easy rides and easy runs, no swimming.
[01:34:33] Gerard Donnelly: Okay.
[01:34:34] Gerard Donnelly: All right?
[01:34:35] Gerard Donnelly: So I've mucked up here, so I don't want him swimming anyway, regardless if he's 7 or 8 out of 10.
[01:34:44] Gerard Donnelly: Okay.
[01:34:45] Gerard Donnelly: So just send him a message.
[01:34:46] Gerard Donnelly: So when he wakes up, it's still nighttime there, so he might get it.
[01:34:52] Gerard Donnelly: It's probably 10, 10 p.m., is it?
[01:34:54] Gerard Donnelly: It's 7 hours, It's 10.30, isn't that much?
[01:34:58] Gerard Donnelly: Good night, maybe.
[01:35:01] Gerard Donnelly: You just adjust this week according to how you think he's going, okay?
[01:35:06] Gerard Donnelly: Yep.
[01:35:09] Abby Jorgensen: All right.
[01:35:09] Gerard Donnelly: I'm sorry for my computer.
[01:35:13] Gerard Donnelly: You okay with everybody else then?
[01:35:16] Abby Jorgensen: Yeah.
[01:35:17] Abby Jorgensen: Everybody else is going pretty good, I think.
[01:35:19] Abby Jorgensen: I feel.
[01:35:20] Abby Jorgensen: Yep.
[01:35:21] Abby Jorgensen: On top of it.
[01:35:23] Gerard Donnelly: Yeah.
[01:35:25] Abby Jorgensen: Yep.
[01:35:26] Gerard Donnelly: All right.
[01:35:26] Gerard Donnelly: Well, thanks for that.
[01:35:29] Gerard Donnelly: And we'll have a good week.
[01:35:31] Gerard Donnelly: Yeah.
[01:35:31] Abby Jorgensen: And then Floyd and or somebody will send me.
[01:35:35] Abby Jorgensen: Yes.
[01:35:36] Gerard Donnelly: James.
[01:35:37] Gerard Donnelly: Floyd and won't be waking up.
[01:35:39] Gerard Donnelly: Yeah.
[01:35:40] Gerard Donnelly: Another hour, maybe.
[01:35:43] Abby Jorgensen: And then should I just start him right away or wait till he gets everything or.
[01:35:49] Abby Jorgensen: Yeah.
[01:35:49] Gerard Donnelly: I would be giving him a hotel gym bike session on his bike and give him a 5k park run.
[01:35:59] Gerard Donnelly: Yeah.
[01:35:59] Gerard Donnelly: You
[01:36:00] Gerard Donnelly: And a 1K swim time trial and some steady state running, just easy runs, no intervals on the treadmill this week because we want to test him.
[01:36:17] Gerard Donnelly: And just you do that and I'll have a look at it and I'll move it around when I feel like it needs adjusting.
[01:36:26] Gerard Donnelly: But at the moment, we haven't got anything back from him yet.
[01:36:30] Gerard Donnelly: So I would say it might be a couple of days before, you know, maybe if we started him on Thursday or Wednesday.
[01:36:40] Gerard Donnelly: But that's really his athlete profile form, what days he normally trains.
[01:36:44] Gerard Donnelly: I think I wrote a whole page of notes, but yeah, let's wait and see.
[01:36:54] Gerard Donnelly: Okay.
[01:36:56] Gerard Donnelly: Sounds cool.
[01:36:56] Gerard Donnelly: Okay.
[01:36:57] Gerard Donnelly: All right.
[01:36:58] Gerard Donnelly: stuff.
[01:36:58] Gerard Donnelly: All right.
[01:36:59] Gerard Donnelly: All Bye.
[01:36:59] Gerard Donnelly: See you.
